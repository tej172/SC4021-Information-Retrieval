But people didn't really have a grasp the severe limitations on the technology or even how the industry worked (like no one seemed to consider the aspect that drivers are also security guards for goods).AI replacing musicians, AI replacing actors, AI replacing office workers, AI replacing professionals... yeah that stuff is already happening.

This master program is thought for people without a computer science background so it will tech everything from math to advanced concepts, my question is if is worth it to do so, or should I hose another kind of master, maybe cyber security etc as related more to my bachelor degree in Web development. I was anyway excited about the idea of AI and after the research done in this field by myself and from the idea of what I can build one day, but is the job market ready for this in Europe? Here you have the course structure.To clarify I am a student in a big confusion, which would like to do a master degree in AI(or maybe other related fields) for passion of learning inovative techs and aiming for a better career that I would have just as a web dev.As well feedback from people which finished a master in AI is highly appreciated.&#x200B;* **Legal, Ethical & Professional Issues (10 Credits)**This class ensures students are aware of the legal, social, ethical and professional issues commensurate with the practice of AI as well as, more broadly, information and data science.* **Quantitative Methods for AI (10 Credits)**Quantitative methods such as linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus are needed to understand AI and to keep pace with its development. This course gives students the background in these topics they need.* **Big Data Technologies (20 Credits)**This course gives students an understanding of the challenges posed by big data, an understanding of the key algorithms and techniques which are embodied in data analytics, and exposure to a number of different big data technologies and techniques.* **AI for Autonomous Systems (20 credits)**This course covers gives a basic introduction to AI including topics such as intelligent search.* **Deep Learning & Neural Nets (20 Credits)**The most impactful area of AI has been machine learning using neural networks. When combined with reinforcement learning, these neural networks can also become autonomous agents that can, for example, learn to play games to an extraordinarily high standard. This class will cover these two areas of AI.* **AI for Finance (20 credits)**This class provides an overview of the application of AI techniques -- including those which mimic natural evolutionary processes (genetic algorithms and genetic programming in particular) to a range of financial applications such as forecasting, portfolio optimisation and algorithmic trading.* **Machine Learning for Data Analytics (20 credits)**This class equips students with a sound understanding of the principles of machine learning and a range of popular approaches, along with the knowledge of how and when to apply the techniques.",

We're talking about a single class of people: white-collar knowledge workers.If there are no more white-collar jobs, this means radical change, but not necessarily UBI for them, or the end of work altogether.We still need plumbers, construction workers, factory line workers, surgeons, nurses, etc. There's a lot of jobs that won't be replaced by AI. Generally, we're talking about jobs that are closer to the physical realm of things. And as much as AI will definitely accelerate to levels we can't totally comprehend at the moment, there's no sign (yet) that robotics will accelerate with it. And even if it did, building a robotics industry to replace physical workers takes a lot of time, as it requires a huge time and labor investment on physical things, from resource extraction to labor. There might be a lot of people having to switch careers in the next 10 years, but I'd bet that's mostly us white-collar knowledge workers. Maybe we'll have people moving from software engineering to paramedics; from administrative assistant to factory line worker.Yes, the white collar middle class might end completely. I don't like it. I'm part of it. And one of the factors that will play a huge part in this is the fact that we're total pussies: there will be no revolution by us, and we'll passively accept whatever outcomes are offered us. So yeah, in theory we're fucked when it comes to jobs. But we're not everyone.On the other hand, I believe that by the time we start being replaced by AIs, we'll be much more concerned with other things, such as an actual existential risk to humans as a whole. Who cares about jobs if an AGI is building biological organisms to kill us all?",

Even if they arent the best at their jobs, they will likely crowd these remaining labor fields so hiring managers can lower overall pay.Not saying it will be pretty but anytime a lower cost option presents itself, companies eventually figure out ways to benefit. I absolutely believe that there will be significant drops in average wages across all sectors in the US, specifically for this reason.",

I think there are a few main categories: 1) Jobs involving leadership and power. We're going to value human leadership for the foreseeable future.2) Endeavors that require a cathartic, human connection. This includes certain kinds of art, comedy and entertainment. It also includes at least some forms of therapy/counseling. Weirdly, it also includes influencers and other personalities.3) Roles where a person is providing something integral to the experience. Think waiters/hosts/servers in restaurants. Or messeuses, or operators of treatments in spas. And on a darker note, that includes providers of other forms of sensual contact or content.For example, I probably don't care whether a human or a robot cuts my grass or fixes my plumbing. But I'd want my mayor to be human. I care if my art was made with human yearning and fallibility. Some therapy requires a human connection. And the restaurant without servers would be much like just getting takeout.Even in the above roles, AI will definitely take many of the jobs.",

But AI in the current state is at max an efficiency increase.Which happened all the time. Opus, gpt and so on are assistants not agents. According to more and more industry and research leaders scaling alone will not help.And the second problem is that building a true AGI is an enormously resource and investment heavy endeavor. In a few years this could be just over. We are right now see a lot of cracks in the system. Live expectancy doesn't rise anymore and has never reached pre pandemic levels, IQ is dropping, grades are dropping, drug use is on the rise, war deaths world wide are on the rise. And so on and so on. Last time we saw drops like these were WW2. The base level was of course different but the decrease in live quality over several years world wide is not normal.Oh and climate change seems to accelerate and is right now difficult to model because of the ridiculous warming of the ocean.So the next few years might be the last chance to build an AI. If it doesn't happen in the next five years or something, the lack of investment, intelligence and social structure will make it impossible.",

Initially you wont need junior developers because a senior developer could churn through work by setting AI to do a lot of the grunt work and using his/her experience to put the pieces together. During that time the senior developer who can use AI will would probably see somewhat higher salaries. We are pretty much already at this point in many companies.But AI is constantly improving and all the higher level work the senior devs are doing to correct, improve on, or aggregate what the AI produces becomes training data for the next generation of AIs. Very soon, the threshold has risen past the senior developer and their salaries have tanked. Then maybe you just need a principal engineer or architect who can sketch out the pieces needed for a large scale system and AI can take it from there. Soon after that, you only need someone to describe a proposed software product in general terms and the AI will be able to architect the large scale system, break it down into modular services, and write those services. The threshold will rise constantly and very rapidly.EDIT: typos fixed",

Home automation like washing machines, dishwashers etc; factory automation has been massive in the last 50 years. AI though is mostly threatening menial language based jobs like web content creation and to a lesser degree artistic jobs. This is because of how ChatGPT etc work, theyre language based. Yeah they can start to do some more advanced tasks like basic programming (again language related) but they do an extremely poor job and writing code is only like 30% of a programmers job. Its not really threatening anything there but is a tool that can be leveraged. The idea that AI will take over all jobs including physical oriented ones Id just ridiculous to me. I worked at a company that did ML sentiment analysis a while back and its really hard to train a model on something and have the results be accurate, especially where there is a lot of nuance. Yes since that era things have gotten better but you still need massive training sets and you train it to do specific things. They really are not smart at all. Its bs hype to get VC funding.",

Similarly, high level decision makers and those working on cutting-edge research will also likely be less at risk of being replaced by AI.* *On the other hand, I do think that repetitive, low skill office work is more vulnerable to automation. While these jobs may not require a high level of expertise, they can still be crucial to a company's operations and it's important to consider how the loss of these positions could impact employees.* *Ultimately, it's important for all workers to continuously upskill and adapt to the changing job market in order to stay competitive.

But let's be real, AI isn't the enemy - it's a tool, and like any tool, it's only as good as the person wielding it.Think about it: content writers who know how to use AI-powered research tools and language generators can produce high-quality content faster and more efficiently than ever before. Web developers who can harness the power of machine learning can build websites that are more intuitive and user-friendly. And data analysts who can work with AI to identify patterns and trends can make predictions and decisions that were previously impossible.The point is, AI isn't here to replace us - it's here to augment us. It's here to make us faster, smarter, and more productive. So, instead of fearing the robots, let's learn how to work with them. Let's upskill and reskill, and become the masters of our own AI-powered destinies.Remember, it's not the AI that's going to take your job - it's the person who knows how to use AI to do your job better, faster, and cheaper.",

But during the screening call, things got interesting. When asked about their experience, they simply read through the job description and claimed they could do everything on itwithout giving a single real-world example.It just so happens this person had just finished a course in \"AI Management\" as well Was I being too sceptical? Was this person potentially JUST AMAZING? Or did I make the right callAI can make recruitment more efficient, but its also creating new challenges. As hiring professionals, our ability to dig deeper, ask the right questions, and assess real expertise is more important than ever.Have you noticed similar patterns in your areas of expertise?

Wealthy individuals and corporations use their AI systems to produce for their needs directly. Mercantilism and then capitalism took over from the feudal economy because the wealthy and powerful wanted the products of supply chains that were too difficult for them to manage directly whether due to distance or complexity. AI solves that problem, so a future tech mogul will produce the goods and services they need within their household the same way a feudal lord or Roman equestrian would, with some trading at the margins. The only differences are the products now include high tech goods as well as staples such as food and cloth and it's AI and robots doing the work instead of serfs or slaves.Of course that's assuming you get to true human level AI.",

And yes, companies USE this right now. You can argue that it is not really creativity, but companies and customers don't care. The online commissions for small art pieces like a DnD character, is dying out already. Mostly kept alive by some people not wanting to use AI.* Sales, now a days online is done more then offline. AI rules there. AI is what decides what personal advertisements you get to see and what sales are shown to you when you enter many websites. Offline sales is a different story however. But even then, AI will probably already influenced your choice what store you went to without you knowing.",

        "text": "As a ProcessAgilist, automating workflow using AI, I'm frequently confronted with the question: Doesn't automation lead to \"job loss\"? Isn't someone going be fired because of you? How can you live with yourself? Aren't we just automating jobs away?That's a tough one, and I get it. If you've made your money a certain way for a while, disruptive technology... well... Disrupts!Automation changes the way we work, no doubt about it. It often makes certain roles obsolete. History has repeatedly shown us that when a door closes, a window opensoften to a room with a much broader view. Remember the Pony Express? Revolutionary in its day, yet it couldn't outpace the advent of the telegraph. And look at us now, communicating across the globe in an instant on LinkedIn. Gone are the days of milling flour by hand, and your daily bread we're all so thankful for, is within easier reach for everyone due to automation.My job isn't to replace people with machines; it's to find ways to let machines do the repetitive, boring, tedious stuff so that people can focus on what they're best at solving real problems, being creative, creating genuine connections.The way I see it, I help people transition from one opportunity to the next, upping their game in a world where change is the only constant.Sure, it's challenging, but it's also exciting. We're not just workers; we're learners and innovators. And if history's shown us anything, it's that, as a species, we're pretty good at adapting.If you're not part of the automation process, you will certainly be disrupted BY it. Learn the trade being created by the automation, rather than defending the trade supplanted by it. The microwave has saved countless hours of toil. Restaurants learned to harness the power of microwave technology to make better food faster, rather than trying to outlaw them. Not all food comes out quite right when microwaved... and not every job can be replaced by AI... but the jobs will surely change. People won't be directly replaced by AI, but those who know how to use it will surely replace those who don't.Lets not fear automation. Let's use it as a tool to create a future where work is more about what we bring to the table as humans creativity, empathy, innovation. Recognize how AI impacts your profession so you can shape that future rather than become a victim of it. Become the first tailor to master the sewing machine. Let's brainstorm that future together to make it one we're proud of.",

I kept asking myself:How do I stay relevant?What skills do I need to make sure AI doesnt outshine me?I noticed two types of people around me:Those resisting AI, pretending its just a trend.And those leveraging it to 10x their output.I didnt want to be left behind, but diving into AI felt overwhelminguntil I shifted my mindset. Instead of seeing AI as a competitor, I started treating it as an ally.So, I took action. I enrolled in weekend workshop byand learned how to make AI work for me.Now, I use AI to: Simplify research Automate repetitive tasks Boost creativity and efficiencyAnd yes, Ill definitely be using it in my projects and assignments too!The key takeaway? AI wont replace you.But the person who knows how to use AI will definitely have an edge.",

Like there are some jobs like art, music, and caregiving where the human touch is irreplaceable.So, in my opinion, maybe it's more about humans and AI working together rather than one replacing the other.Let's have an open discussion about this.

People told me not to go into my field more than a decade ago because AI and molecular biology would replace me in the short term. Now I am chronically overworked making hundreds of thousands a year with no replacement in sight. Sometimes trying to guess the future is a worse strategy than focusing on what's directly ahead. And what should they do exactly? They are making a living right now with their skillets. Should they all start retraining as plumbers? Should they crawl up in a ball and cry about it? What a weird stance OP has. Like I know the future and I'm anxious about it (although it's unclear what they can do) while they are not so they are dumb? The most ironic thing in all of this is that 10 or 20 years ago with automation looming people like OP were telling everyone that the solution was to \"learn to code\". His colleagues did exactly what future-anxious prognosticators were telling them, and now their are supposedly on the verge of the precipice of unemployment? Shows what good it does trying to follow those predictions.And maybe, just maybe (I know this sounds crazy) people here are incorrect about the future or the time-line. Maybe his colleagues will still have jobs in the field (albeit different ones) ten or even 20 years from now? Just for fun look at the predictions made by this sub in 2018, didn't age very well.",

The goal was to use as much AI as possible to do the copy editing, in other words, reduce the reliance on humans to do copy editing (I'm, of course, euphamising ).After two years, and a huge amount of money spent, they finally deployed it into production. They soon realized that it wasn't good enough, and everything the AI did finally had to be double checked and corrected by a human. Essentially, the time taken by the human to check and correct the output was the same as if the human had done it from start to finish without any AI help.They disbanded their (by now quite large) AI/DS team, and decommissioned the platform they had built. They went back to humans doing what they were doing, the old school way.Story 2:A rich law firm (which, again, shall remain unnamed) that a contact works in also tried to do similar things to replace paralegals. They employed a large number of highly paid AI engineers/Data scientists to create something that could reduce their paralegal costs (aka help make some paralegal staff redundant and still do the job). After a lot of time and money, they found the solution unreliable, and went back to the old way.P.S. - Some additional context on the copy editing story. I was quite surprised by what my contact said, and asked why it was the case when grammar checkers are really quite good these days. My contact explained to me was that copy-editing involves more than just grammar correction. If grammar correction was all that was needed, spelling and grammar checkers would have replaced copy editors years, if not a decade, ago.",

But when it comes to integrating these pieces into real-world projects, they're still far from replacing actual programmers - despite the hype.The reality? Even the leading tech companies working on AI still actively hire developers, because AI cant yet structure, debug, or maintain large-scale projects reliably. It struggles with context, architecture, and the deeper understanding required for real-world applications.A simple example: I asked GPT-o3 mini (high) to generate an animation for bench pressing using [https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/docs/userguide.html](https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/docs/userguide.html) It failed completely. Not even close.So, what are some of your \"AI fails\" when it comes to coding? Drop your impossible AI prompts below!",

Regulation seems like a band-aid at best, slowing innovation for a short period before it inevitably continues. AI can be very bad for society and the world or it can be very good. Jobs will be replaced, people don't have to be. The ONLY way AI will be seen as a benefit to people is if it actually benefits people. And the only way I see that happening is through some sort of UBI. Most people do not go to work everyday because they want to. They do it because they have to. They need the money for food, shelter, healthcare, entertainment, etc... This isn't to say that people would stop working all together. Humans are creative and we love making things. That will not stop. In fact, without the burden of needing a job we will be free to pursue work we enjoy. Of course, many people who find purpose in their work will suffer depression from not being needed anymore but purpose can be found elsewhere. Jobs will be replaced, purpose will not.People don't cry for those who've retired, they look at retirement as aspirational. AI can be the mechanism by which we unchain ourselves from the treadmill of survival. Or it can be our doom. But one thing it can't be is stopped. Pandora's box has been opened, just a crack for now, and we don't have much time to prepare before the lid is blown off.",

They all seem to have the same line of thought, something like \"There will always be new jobs created\" or \"People will need to learn new skills to use AI\". Like what? What new jobs? AI prompter? what happens when you can automate that? Why so much denial? Rather than cling on to a job you hate, why don't you demand social change so we can actually all benefit from this abundance?EDIT: Comment section proved me right.",

I think people will remain important, in part because companies will always want a human to have some degree of responsibility (in part to have someone to yell at if it goes wrong) and I think there is room for some developers to pivot in a conceptual design, or stakeholder management direction. Part of the reason I would avoid over-indexing is if the most optimistic perspective on this sub is correct, few jobs will be viable in a few years time anyway which would make any pivot/future-proofing challenging with the limited visibility we have now.",

        "text": "tl;dr: by the time a problem is articulated well enough to be viable for something like SWE-bench, as a senior engineer, I basically consider the problem solved. What SWE-bench measures is not a relevant metric for my job.note: I'm not saying it won't happen, so please don't misconstrue me (see last paragraph). But I think SWE-bench is a misleading metric that's confusing the conversation for those outside the field.An anecdote: when I was a new junior dev, I did a lot of contract work. I quickly discovered that I was terrible at estimating how long a project would take. This is so common it's basically a trope in programming. Why? Because if you can describe the problems in enough detail to know how long they will take to solve, you've done most of the work of solving the problems. A corollary; much later in management I learned just how worthless interview coding questions can be. Someone who has memorized all of the \"one weird tricks\" for programming does not necessarily evolve into a good senior programmer over time. It works fine for the first two levels of entry programmers, who are given \"tasks\" or \"projects\" respectively. But as soon as you're past the junior levels, you're expected to work on \"outcomes\" or \"business objectives.\" You're designing systems, not implementing algorithms.SWE-bench uses \"issues\" from Github. This sounds like it's doing things humans can't, but that fundamentally misunderstands what these issues represent. Really what it's measuring is the problems that nobody bothered allocating enough human resources to solve. If you look at the actual issue-prompts, they're are incredibly well-defined; so much so I suspect many of them were in fact written by programmers to begin with (and do not remotely resemble the type of bug reports sent to a typical B2C software company -- when's the last time your customer support email included the phrase \"trailing whitespace?\"). To that end, solving SWE-bench problems is a great time-saver for resource-constrained projects: it is a solution to busywork. But it doesn't mean that the LLM is \"replacing\" programmers...To do my job today, the AI would need to do the coding equivalent of coming up with a near perfect answer to the prompt: \"research, design, and market new products for my company.\" The nebulous nature of the requirement is the very definition of \"not being a junior engineer.\" It's about reasoning with trade-offs: what kind of products? Are the ideas on-brand? Is the design appealing to customers? What marketing language will work best? These are all analogous to what I do as a senior engineer, with code instead of English. Am I scared for junior devs these days? Absolutely. But I'm also hopeful. AI is saving lots of time implementing solutions which, for years now, have just been busywork to me. The hard part is knowing which algorithms to write and why, or how to describe a problem well enough that it CAN be solved. If schools/junior devs can focus more time on that, then they will become skilled senior engineers more quickly. We may need fewer programmers per project, but that just means there is more talent to start other projects IMO, freeing up intellectual resources for the high-order problems.Of course, if AGI enters the chat, then all bets are off. Once AI can reason about these complex trade-offs and make good decisions at every turn, then sure, it will replace my job... and every other job.",

It will start to show decent signs of 5-15% increase in layoffs in some sectors in about 3 years with all the implementations done during these coming years. It will hit the simpler jobs at first and slowly with more implementation dig into the more complex ones. Its the implementation not the development that slows everything down. Some will manage to keep positions as admins of ai.5 to 10 years from now will probably mean we will get to 30% workforce that get hit by it and then its getting close to catastrophic if no safety nets are deployed. There will be a huge crisis that will narrow the difference between high class, middle class and poverty class completely. Only the ultra isolated leaders will own things while defended by ai. Once the ai and robotics are implemented fully and the environment is adjusted for their deficiencies then its bye bye work everywhere.",

Students cant use AIs to write their essays, or risk getting tossed out of Uni. Submitting an AI artwork to a contest can get you banned from future submissions. Etc, etc.Now, there ARE places where AI is both accepted and embraced by industries, like in writing & testing software. But designing a bridge (ex, using generative AI designs) is both dangerous and not easy to control, so even though engineers are trying to use AI there, its not worth the effort in many cases.2070, IF AT ALL!

The whole ride share industry wants to replace people with autonomous driving. At the end of the day these corporations with AI or without it will always decide the best way to maximize profits. So I'll always strongly advocate for stronger labor rights and protections. Just because an industry has been long standing doesn't necessarily mean that it's not vulnerable to change. Many industries have been wiped by different approaches. I'll honestly say sales and most blue collar jobs can be replaceable. If the cost to hire said individual is high and the profits / cost savings from implementing an AI system (+ research) is worth it then it will be done. It will also all depend on the consumer adoption. It's been a long time since we can pick a single career and grow old with said career. Some are lucky while others need to handle multiple jobs to keep their income stability. And to be clear I don't want people to lose their job but I also don't want people to be in situations where their job feels like a dead end or soul draining.",

The only thing terrifying about it is that so many people find it terrifying. Mass insanity. There are numerous reasons people are in denial about the end of work, fallacious arguments about it being unfeasible, and when that fails, they come up with weak arguments for why its undesirable. All these arguments intersect with either fear, selfishness and/or ignorance. We all have these things, were only human, but this particular instance is going to cause a lot of pain and confusion. I can shoot down ANY argument saying that AI wont replace jobs and why thats a good thing. I hate to resort to ad hominem, but when smart people argue otherwise it reveals a love of dominance orientation, work ethic, and possibly a feeling that human life isnt inherently valuable, but only valuable in its relationship with contributions to a free market. I really need to clear my head and write a book or make a video breaking all this down. But Im too busy working!",

Yes, there will be job displacement, but we'll adapt to that as we always have. The correct thing to fear is that ASI will decide to enslave or kill us all (for example, because it was developed by a power-hungry Nazi damn I wish I still lived in a world where that was only an epithet rather than a literal description), who didn't bother with any safety/alignment training. Stopping or outmaneuvering any intelligence significantly greater than our own will be pretty much impossible. My *hope* is that it will also surpass us in ethical behavior. But I don't see any way to be certain until we get to that point.",

What I do think though is that they'll just be less room maybe and a lot of people are definitely going to have to retrain. But I think programmers along with doctors are probably the safest for now.Only because of what you said, and as far as health goes, people are not going to want to trust their health to a robot....at first. I think we will see a lot of layoffs though in the technology sector were already seeing that and although what we're seeing now probably doesn't have too much to do with AI, I can definitely see a lot of lower-level stuff start to be pruned and \"streamlined\".",

Unemployment is bad as it is, if we replace more and more people with AI, we are going to end up with a situation where only jobs that AI can't replace are highly specialised jobs that require PHD's and manual work like construction workers or factory workers. Now that leads to 2 scenarios: A) a person needs to get a better education, meaning that they need to spend money they don't have because they don't work on it, or they live in a country with free education, so the person who was a working member of society that was contributing to the economy must now spend X years not doing that.B) a person goes to work in a lower paying manual job, sadly the market gets overstuffed with people like them, meaning that even tho the unemployment is high they cannot have find a job. Or the job they get is paying them a slave wage due to the fact they will work for any money.Yes I am for progress and scientific breakthroughs, but society as is right now cannot take mass job replacement, even if most office jobs are worthless.Add to it my personal dislike of many pro ai people being very happy to replace humans in creative fields such as writing or making art and you have why I'm against ai replacing jobs atm.",

Concentration in Computational Intelligence, both from my own interest and for job security. -AI will replace some jobs in the near future.-AGIs birthdate is unknown. When it arrives, it will take time to be implemented in a way that seriously affects jobs.-AGI will have a profound impact on the job market as a whole when its implementation storms society.-I graduate in 2025 with a data science/AI degree. I have a SWE internship under my belt with a small startup.-I have considered AI jobs to be the last line of defense for job security with these points in mind but I understand that is a potentially wrong oversimplification.-Still, even when AGI arrives, its implementation will take some time. Thats where AI jobs may come into play even when theres not much more substantial research to be done.-With that in mind, I feel I have decent job security.-If I am wrong - and AGIs arrival and subsequent implementation truly does destroy my career prospects - i believe that many others would be fucked as well.-If too many people are out of a job, and the economy goes to shit, the government may step in. UBI, hopefully. In that case, Ill still be okay.Thoughts are a bit scattered. Sorry.Just looking for some soft opinions. No way we can really know, obviously. Just want some thoughts",

However, I believe software engineering will continue to evolve rather than become less lucrative.

Additionally, new technologies and platforms emerge, creating fresh opportunities. Education might adapt to focus more on these higher-level skills and AI collaboration. So, rather than reducing salaries, we might see a shift in the skills that are most valued, keeping the field both relevant and rewarding.",

I know that lots of people don't believe that UBI will happen, because why would corporations give handouts when they don't need to, which is understandable, but they're also not stupid and know their history. No jobs and no money will mean social unrest and eventually revolution. In order to keep the masses placated and docile, so the corporations can keep making the big bucks and big decisions, they will HAVE to implement UBI.",

This matches what I've seen on the ground, especially in highly regulated fields like finance or fintech: AI enhances analysis but doesn't replace judgment.Most telling: AI adoption clusters in mid-to-high salary knowledge work. Senior executives and physical laborers both show minimal AI impact. This tracks - AI excels at processing information, not at either making complex strategic decisions or performing physical tasks.Here's the stat you should watch out for: Only 4% of jobs heavily use AI, but 36% are starting to experiment. We're seeing more \"Microsoft Excel for knowledge work\" than \"robots taking jobs.\"Question for my finance folks: How do we value productivity gains from AI augmentation vs cost savings from automation? The data suggest we might be looking at the wrong metrics.Interested? Read more about this fascinating work here:",

Although it has nothing to share with my engineering background, it makes me think whether it is a good time in history to switch attention from the hard (engineering) skill that Ive pursued over the last 2.5 decades to pure soft and networking skills that might become the pivotal asset for all of us.Maybe, just maybe, this upcoming AI revolution will give us back what the Industrial Revolution took away: time to just be with one another.Im an addict workaholic and the thought of spending time away from my beloved keyboard and distributed architecture problems is scary.

And we're using generalized tools (Open AI 4o) with a team consisting of Baby Boomers, Gen Z and Millennials (showing that it has widespread adoption).As we move into the future, the tools will get better and more specialized. People who don't recognize this will find themselves in a fundamentally different world because the impact is here already - not some hype of \"oh one day we'll all live in the metaverse\". No it's already happening nowTo add more - I was building specialized use cases for a Big 4 consulting firm 2 years ago. We were seeing 40% time save THEN and the models are faster, cheaper, and more capable now. People who think AI is overblown have not used it or seen what it can do",

The criteria is not 'a bunch of people talked'. The issue rather lies in making use of various skills and knowledge - which as I described, in my opinion, will still have areas where humans outperform even when in others we have superhuman capabilities - as well as - tougher - considering risks, strategy, fitting into other plans, enabling decentralized actions, real-world experience, other humans, etc.So long as humans are part of the equation, I don't think you will get rid of coordination being key. Perhaps you can effectivize it though.I would also not agree with average human level being good enough for the rapid change. At least you must mean average professional for the task; though most likely you may need top x %.I am also of the view that jobs shift to where there is a need. So if we know that e.g. writing websites now can be done by AI if given a spec, then humans will be working more on specs and overall be able to produce more.Finally, I think that even if you got to that level, it would take organizations at least decade to actually adapt to it properly. The first five years might just be to prove that it works.",

        "text": "AI, Job Cuts, and Singapores Economic Future Whats Next?The wave of job cuts driven by Artificial Intelligence has already begun, starting with Banking, Finance, and Insuranceindustries that heavily rely on white-collar workers. As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.If the US faces a recession in 2025, it will \"Turbocharge\" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapores economic growth to be between 1% and 3%a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.At the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.Looking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globallybut we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.The key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?What do you think?",

In part 1, I laid out how the benefits of innovation in the Skolt Lapp community wrought disaster because of its uneven distribution.This pattern is playing out right now with AI: companies and individuals who can afford to invest in AI systems are automating tasks, cutting costs, and boosting profits: According to a Goldman Sachs report, AI could displace ~300 million full-time jobs globally (Source: Goldman Sachs via BBC). A conservative estimate IMHO. The World Economic Forum separately predicts that more than 7.5 million data entry jobs will be lost by 2027. (Source: World Economic Forum) Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently highlighted that more than 25% of new code at his company is written by AI. It's just the start. (Source: Google EOQ3 Earnings Call)Normal, everyday workers displaced by AI, directly or indirectly, are left duking it out for fewer, lower-paying jobs. And, the gains of their displacement going to the top, not to the increasingly insecure workers fortunate to survive the cuts.There is a long record of how innovations can disrupt communities.In part 3, Ill highlight what policymakers must do to ensure a more equitable distribution of AIs windfalls.",

Most people can already not tell the difference between the quality of something that someone who understands AI made and someone who randomly generated something with AI made, compare that to a cabinet built by a professional carpenter and a cabinet built by a novice. Do you really think the professional carpenters in this scenario are going to win out when the quality difference withers so much it's no longer even noticeable?There is only so much demand to go around and AI will fill the demand so fast that even if some people do adapt, 98% of them will quickly become obsolete. Do you think the super pro lawyer with his AI increasing his efficiency by 50x needs a firm of 100 expensive lawyers on the payroll? -> apply that logic to any industry. Demand does not increase as a result of all of this, so this unregulated growth will be nothing but a net negative for a society built around individualist incentive structures.",

We also saw more interest in Adversarial Machine Learning (GANs were invented in 2014.) All of this set a continuous ground-work for further advancements in the late 2010's and early 2020's (i.e. transformers, diffusion models, alphafold, etc.) There was no discontinuity in primary research as we saw in the 70's and 90's. The practicality of deep learning created doors which have not yet all been opened.We're still in what is called the \"deep learning revolution.\"",

We already had a drastic improvement from gpt 3 to gpt 4, including performance on exams for numerous fields of knowledge. And gpt 5 is due to December. We are seeing some eye-opening developments in its approach to abstract problems. So really, stop with the \"i tried it and its kinda overrated\". About 1 year ago everyone thought that what is going on now was only going to happen a decade or more from now. It's going FAST. I don't know what impact will this have, I can see it going both ways: since 50 people can be cut down to 10 in a company, it also means lots of startups with 10 people can thrive, lots of entrepreneurs will need far less capital to start their businesses. But the gain in productivity could be so huge that the supply will become higher than the demand. Developers will be needed but they'll earn less.People have been telling themselves \"Developing is so much more than coding so if the AI can replace you because of that you're not a good developer to begin with\" and I agree. But you need to stop thinking that this is where AI will stop. It is showing that is capable of going beyond merely coding NOW, and we've barely scratched the surface of this potential.",

Not that we will have robotic construction workers soon, just an easy example to visualize.For the most part AI will be dumb and very industry specific for quite awhile and even then robotics are so far behind AI that you don't have to worry much about waves of AI replacing jobs.It's like being afraid of computers replacing jobs, technically they did speed up many repetitive tasks and eliminate jobs, but they created so many more you never noticed.AI as it's happening now, with the slow moving pace of robotics, is more like Computer 2.0 than it represents a huge boost to markets in general. It's very useful for drug model and other puzzle solving or simple repetitive processes like sorting trash, but it's not useful for tons of other stuff beyond making a phones and computers are bit easier to use.",

The same thing will happen here. Those who are really good (creative?) at using AI in the transition will get great jobs either in using AI or performing quality control type of oversight.

Then, some managed to domesticate animals like horses, and humans used them to till fields and for transport. It no longer made sense for a person to till a field. Later, engines displaced the horses. The economy didn't have a use for all of the horses it had before, and the horse population shrunk.Humans found other things they could do that animals and engines couldn't, however, because of their brains. But, if AI (and robots) do a better job than humans, I think it becomes a real question what economic work humans can actually do. Remember, someone has to be willing to pay for your work which (by the assumptions of this argument) are less efficient and less good than what AI & robots can produce. So I'm not sure I see how the current economic system is going to survive that.",

Large companies will pay us to do that.For example, the new roles might involve recording real-time human conversations and monitoring specific areas of the brain to further optimize AI performance 24/7. Other possibilities include dedicating ourselves full time to writing text for every situation, recording new conversations, tracking our movements, analyzing our thought patterns, and documenting our chains of thought and reasoning, all in real time and as a full-time commitment. Essentially, everything that AI currently lacks.Large companies have already been doing this, primarily collecting data from the internet and our phones, but not to their full potential. There remain elements and nuances that exist only in the real world and are not present online.Even if each person's individual contribution may seem insignificant for large companies, if too many people perform that job every day, incredible advancements for AI could be achieved. Moreover, in a scenario where AI dominates the job market, large companies might pay us simply to exist, essentially a form of universal basic income, or at least in a utopian scenario.Once these models become even smarter, a large portion of the population could become insignificant in the economy, as AI would be the most intelligent and productive entity in the world. The only real limitation of AI is its ability to operate in the physical world. For now, AI cannot perform the work of a plumber, but it is only a matter of time.Perhaps our generation will be spared from this hypothetical scenario, though it remains a possibility. Perhaps there may be new forms such as neo-feudalism, post-capitalism, etc. or some type of communism.Undoubtedly, all of this will lead to chaos, potential wars, social problems, and much more if things do not go smoothly.Obviously, this is speculation and assumptions, but I believe it is a good idea to be prepared, even if we practically cannot do anything for ourselves.Whatever happens in the future, I wish you all good luck.",

Having multiple agents cooperating can help with plan step generation, validation, and execution, but sometimes you just need a good old fashioned eureka moment that comes from thinking outside the box, based on an entirely spontaneous new perspective to a problem. In my experience AI can only get there if prompted with truly human-level insight.In the long run a GPT-based society of mind approach like this will likely work for straightforward development work, but some major advancements are needed before AI shows any true creativity. And even though this may only be required for, say, 5% of problems encountered, oftentimes these are the problems/requirements that make or break a product direction, vision, or engineering decision.If we can automate away boilerplate code generation and straightforward CRUD development, it's great news for me as a developer. I can better focus my efforts on areas where my human intuition shines and use tools like these to amplify my productivity. I have zero worries about AI handling anything beyond that at this point, and I certainly don't fear for my job.My two cents.",

That's also work - you got to prompt it and then judge the results - are they what you wanted?If we get the cold shoulder and can't use corporate products we would need to build our own means of production and be self reliant, that's work. But we can use lesser AIs and tech for ourselves, and we know how to do it. We just can't be separated from the means to make a living.For now, AI can't replace any job. Programmers, writers, graphical artists, drivers - they are all still needed. AI helps here and there, but it is just a platform equally accessible to you and your competitors.

Its also about the**massive volume**of such tasks that arent being done at all, simply because there arent enough humans available.* Watching meteors (Astronomy)* Tutoring (Education)* Investigations (Journalism)* Checking fraud (Finance, Cybersecurity)* Empathic listening (Mental Health)**Billions**of people lack access to expertsteachers, doctors, nurses, therapists, investigatorsbecause these**Intelligence Tasks**take time, money, and specialized knowledge.# Measuring Intelligence Task Execution with KISACTo evaluate how well a person (or AI) performs these tasks, consider**KISAC**:1. **Knowledge** How deeply do they know the field, history, main thinkers, theories, books, etc.?2. **Intelligence** How adept are they at recognizing patterns and delivering insight?3. **Speed** How quickly can they complete tasks at a high standard?4. **Accuracy** How often do they get it right versus making mistakes?5. **Cost** How expensive is it to hire, train, and keep them doing the task?# Human vs. AI on KISAC# 1. Knowledge* **Humans**: A dedicated expert might read thousands of books in a lifetime, see a few thousand examples, and thats considered highly trained.* **AI**: Can ingest basically**all**available books, case studies, and datamaintaining perfect recall.# 2. Intelligence* **Humans**: Average IQ ~100. A rare few might reach 180, but thats extremely uncommon.* **AI**: Surpassed a childs intelligence in 2022. By 2024, its around ~100 IQ (task-dependent). Experts believe some models will reach genius-level soon. In certain narrow tasks, theyre already*beyond*human ability.# 3. Speed* **Humans**: * Checking moles: a few hundred a day * Summarizing articles: maybe 520 daily * Assessing X-Rays: 100500 daily* **AI**: * Checking moles:**millions**per day * Summarizing articles:**thousands**per day * Assessing X-Rays:**hundreds of thousands**per dayAnd thats typically**one**AI instancescale it up with more instances and you can multiply those outputs by 10x, 100x, or 1000x.# 4. Accuracy* **Humans**: Highly accurate if they work slowly, but errors (especially medical) are alarmingly common.* **AI**: * Already rivaling or surpassing doctors in diagnosing diseases or evaluating X-Rays. * Efficiency and automation mean multiple checks/validations can reduce errors further.# 5. Cost* **Humans**: * Expensive to train, maintain, retrain, and replace. * High performers demand higher salaries.* **AI**: * A fraction of the cost for most tasks. * A single upgrade to a core model instantly elevates an entire AI team. * The difference in cost between mid-level and top-level performance is negligible.# Real-World ExampleImagine a top-performing claims analyst, Carol, who processes 29 cases a day with 89% accuracy at a salary of $137,200/year. Now picture an AI that can handle**29,000**cases a day at**93% accuracy**for**$3,500/year**. That gapin both volume and costwill keep widening as AI improves.# The Big Picture: Companies Are Just Intelligence PipelinesWhen you strip away the fluff,**companies are just sequences of intelligence-based tasks**that aim for a goal. AI is getting incredibly good at these tasks:1. Faster2. More accurately3. At a fraction of the costThis has profound implications:* **Businesses that leverage AI will dominate.**Those that dont will be left behind.* **Entire pipelines once handled by humans**will soon be**mostly AI-driven**.* **AI isn't just chatbots or image generators**; its the entire knowledge workforce across industries.# Why This Matters* Most intelligence tasks on Earth arent even done right now, because we lack people-power. AI fills that gap instantly.* For the tasks we do manage, AI can do them at radically higher scale and lower cost.* **Its not about replacing humans**as much as its about unveiling an enormous new capacity for workwhere speed, accuracy, and affordability converge.**In short, AIs real revolution is quietly taking place in back offices, research labs, customer service teams, medical facilities, and countless other places**anywhere human minds were once the only option.**TL;DR:*** **AI**=**execution of Intelligence Tasks**at superhuman scale and speed.* **Companies**=**chains of these tasks**(Intelligence Pipelines).* **Future**: Those who harness AI flourish. Those who dont risk obsolescence.**So, forget the flashy demos.**The real story of AI is that its going to handle huge volumes of specialized knowledge workand do it better, faster, and cheaper than we ever thought possible.",

God knows there is a lot areas that badly needs moren automation and just better systems. In the US in particular anything to do with medical billing and records or anything to do with government could be improved dramatically. And that's just scratching the surface. But I doubt that this will result in greater demand for developers. Maybe for experienced ones that are able to efficiently validate AI output. Especially for those that embrace these tools and learn to use them effectively. Fingers crossed!For junior and entry level devs times will most likely be tougher going forward.",

The whole thing about keeping humans but increasing productivity I disagree with though, because if you have ai plus robots that are cheaper faster better and safer, the idea that businesses will spend money on human employees, which are probably gonna be constraints on the potential trillion dollar valuations they could have, just doesnt make sense to me.Yep. Do you remember the massive outsourcing that was happening since like the 80s? Hundreds of factories moved to China to save a buck. Replacing humans with AI will be even a lot more lucrative and probably easier than move entire production half across the world. And yeah, I think the even the CEOs that sign off on this will understand that this will cause issues with economy at large - but then again are you not going to do it when all your competitors are doing it? That's how the game is set up. Massive government action will be required but even then you have the risk of capital flight...",

I know my concerns are more of a philosophical nature, but I also want to understand ai better, and I hope someone will be able to answer my question here. I dont know many details about AI, but Ive been playing with openai for a past few days, and it lead me to really paranoid thoughts and Ive became more suicidal than ever. I spent my whole life reading, drawing and just creating in general, and I just started studying literature on a university. I always wanted to write a novel, and just share my art with others. I thought that even if I fail, I could still enjoy being a copywriter, because writing gives me the most satisfaction. I wish I could just write and read all the time. Now copywriters are already going extinct because AI can simply do the same job faster.AI replacing artist always seemed impossible. Ive read a lot of sci-fi books and neither author I know of has ever considered that. Now I believe it will do it before it can fully take over easy jobs like cashiers. Ive just read an ai-generated text, and it was great. It really was, and it just started. Im so terrified and depressed. Its not unrecognisable yet but it already came really close. I feel like everything Ive loved so dearly will soon be gone forever. I believe art is what really defines humanity and if Its not created by humans, the humanity will not be humanity anymore and well live just like animals with no other purpose than simply surviving. Im considering dropping out of my university because ai will analyse literature so much faster and better than me, I dont see a point anymore. Ive read a lot of opinions about how AI could never replace human soul and emotion, but thats simply not true. Its great at impersonating and its already getting unrecognisable. It will be cheaper and more productive than human artist, so why would anyone give them a chance?Is there any chance AI will not completely eliminate writers and other artists? I know Im a really paranoid person and I often get obsessed with stuff, so maybe Its just my another delusion. And if not, how can we cope with this reality? I dont know what to do and I wonder if, soon, this will also make other humans all over the world extremely distressed. How will the humanity handle it?",

Decarbonizing our whole infrastructure, customized treatments for every person based on genetics, regular cancer screenings, builders for the 4.5M homes we are short in America. People in the Industrial Revolution thought jobs would be replaced but the world wouldnt become unimaginably better from all the wealth generated out of thin air, and they were wrong. Theres just so much more than your brain is capable of imagining than the jobs that exist now.Were an ambitious species. Every bit of new labor we get we use up for some purpose.",

But they will still exist.Also, I'm sure most companies will not want to even opt for AI workers. The Government would tax the absolute fuck out of them. The thought would be \"You're not paying any actual humans, your labor is done for free, why don't you hand over those extra profits?\"I have no actual train of thought here, but as long as there is fax machines, there will be no AI workers.",

I do think its like some of the other major disruptions that the world has seen (like the argricultural revolution, the industrial revolution or the internet revolution).I still see possibilities for humans on various points: (1) humans still like interacting with other humans, even though much work on the backend will be performed by machines (certainly junior / menial / administrative work), (2) youll likely still need experts to interact with AI on several domains (structure, strategy, validating output, convincing a board or upper management), and (3) its also a question of reliability and formal liabillity: will Open AI, Google of Microsoft start taking liability on tax, legal or financial advice in multi million or billion dollar deals? My guess (but I can of course be fundamentally wrong, I dont claim to be all-knowing here) services will continue to exist, but that more junior roles will disappear. Well be able to produce *massively* more output though, things will go even faster, more diligently, more in-depth.We can only wait and see.",

There is maintenance, calibration, some small tasks that are required to be given to the AI as input, etc. Also, think about business growth. Because you need less people to do the same amount of work, you have the financial freedom to hire more people and try to expand your business. Of course, this is a short term phenomenon because not all businesses could grow (there needs to be a bit more inflation for extra spending). Imagine this. If I am a freelance writer, and I could have an AI that catches grammar and lexical errors, with 99% correctness, then I won't need to hire an editor. But I will probably hire more people so I could have more content which is going to be checked by that AI.The suggestion for using AI in medicine, etc. is also intriguing. That doesn't mean that becoming a doctor will be easy. Hard cases will become easier thanks to careful observation of symptoms. You will be able to get suggestions for treatment, based on those symptoms. Or you could get suggestions for extra clinical trials that often show vital information for a given symptom, etc.",

So maybe a growth in electricians or some sort of labor job that supports the growth of new data centers or energy power plants.",

Yeah, all this shiny new tech is quite blinding to look.You should consider that neural networks may rapidly replace a lot of white collar, creative and other 'thinking' jobs, but to move to fully automated production will require more time and money.Simple words: your employer may buy a LLM service that will write letters and words or make decisions looking at numbers instead of you for a fraction of your salary because compute is fucking cheap, but if you are a factory worker, or some other blue collar job, the employer will have to invest a lot of monies in new production line with an expensive robot doing your job and it will take some time to build.TL;DR: get certified as a robotics service specialist.",

Theoretically if AI improves productivity then all of our lives will be better, after markets correct which usually takes some time.Capitalism Is exactly what you described. Less people working = less profits for companies = less companies surviving. The ones that do make it will be the ones that serve the current economy the best. Everything self adjusts. From a macro standpoint if people have less money then prices of things will go down to match. Again after corrections happen.From the companies perspective implementing AI, whoever does it successfully the first will reap massive benefits as theyll have low costs and high productivity in an economy with a ton of money. The companies last to act probably wont survive due comparatively to high operating costs with low productivity.",

Eventually we might have to rethink the entire way we organize our economy as more and more workers are replaced by robots. Perhaps most people will live off a government unemployment sallary while those in jobs that still require humans will be paid alot of money to perform them.What are your ideas for profiting or avoid becoming destitute from theese developments? What will you invest in?Personally my dream (still very far off) is to build a resort of sorts in a nice tropical setting. A digital detox kind of place where people can come and live in a pre internet environment, close to nature. A place where people can come and connect around a campfire - play and enjoy eachother the way we humans always have. I think there is a need for that already and it is something AI will have a hard time replicating - at least until we get Matrix level VR. I think owning LAND will be a safe bet for the next decades as the cost of building houses plummet and becomes more and more affordable to billions of people who now have to live in cramped apartments. What are your thoughts on this?",

The actual output of code is not the end product for any business. The code is just a means to a business goal. A software developers job is to create both architecture and code that runs well and can be maintained. But the way to achieve that is to understand and break down requirements and to often non technical stakeholders create the solution. If ChatGPT or any other equivalent LLM can just break down business goals to working software we are at a point with AI where all jobs are at risk. But it cant do that you need people to understand people. You also need a real life working codebase written by people who understands and maintains the code. Few companies would blindly trust an AI to run their entire IT department. Also most companies will for a multitude of reasons never run AI on their code base. There is inherent risk there. Imagine a company that makes software for pacemakers, airplanes etc. If you are lacking motivation to study because of AI progress you are honestly just making excuses for your self not to achieve anything. The world and its technology will move on with or without you.",

While I believe there are people who want to see AI drag people who do well in cognitive careers down from their comfortable positions, most are imagining a future with no scarcity where all forms of creativity are accessible to people of all skill levels and we can focus on what we want to do and not what we have to do.A couple of things that often get missed in this:1. Technology tends to replace old jobs and new ones rise in their place.2. Current and future AI (until AGI/ASI) can be used to replace n people with 1 person - OR it can be used by n people produce n times the output.And yes, AGI/ASI is a different conversation and I'm not going to pretend to know what that looks like but I suspect true AGI/ASI is harder than the CEOs who stand to provide tremendously from it are saying and could be a good 10-20 year away. Until then I expect previous patterns to hold.To use your nutritionist example, assuming an AI generated plan is good enough now, they could, for example, shift to more of a coaching role and focus on holding their clients accountable to their goals. Falling off the plan is likely where most clients fail - and an AI is easier to ignore than a human being.",

Right now, some of it feels like magic tricks because the new hasn't worn off, and people who don't use AI at all wonder how you could do something so fast, etc.But, I have to work for at the very least 10 more years. I don't think AI will replace humans, but I also see SO many jobs can be so largely automated. My question to the group is how to we plan our \"careers\" if we see the potential for AI to upend the known world? How can we position ourselves? By learning as much as we can and being end users? By going back to school to become AI engineers or whatnot? By bugging out to the country and learning to garden? Forgive me if this has been asked, but I'm really trying for a career pivot, and I honestly am interested in your ideas about what work looks like in 5 years, 10 years, and how I can work and continue to eat and pay my mortgage.",

There are industries with less regulation that will feel it first Im sure, but many others that it will take some time, years I would imagine, for AI to replace due to regulation. I can see aspects of the medical field becoming more and more automated as AI improves, research being one them, but its difficult to imagine that the general populace or lawmakers will allow doctors of various specialties to be replaced without an extensive vetting system to ensure the machines ACTUALLY know what theyre doing and can make the right decisions when needed. In that field specifically, I can imagine years of testing and vetting followed by years of doctors or surgeons essentially baby sitting AI while the machines do all of the actual work. Look at Tesla and however many other automakers that are trying to get the driverless car thing going. I honestly thought we would see that more mainstream by now. Its definitely coming, but its not here yet.In the end, I agree that its scary. My job will probably be among the early sets to be automated away. And there will almost certainly be a period of upheaval and unrest as more and more people become obsolete. But that isnt sustainable with UBI or something like it. Society will collapse under the weight of its own innovation as the greedy corporations try to save money by replacing human workers but ultimately lose money because no one can afford their products.",

Which should be great people can work less hours and earn the same amount, right?Well it looks like even though computing has provided a massive boost in throughput of work via automation and digitisation we are seeing people working longer and harder.Also as people have been displaced from manufacturing they have been able to migrate to the growing service sector. But as AI and IT systems improve we can expect to see a massive reduction in this area.Transportation and other knowledge based jobs will be reduced and trimmed. Did you know the average modern commercial pilot only manually controls a flight for about 6-8 minutes?Our current economy is top down with banks and governments distributing new money into the system. In this top down approach wealth should in theory trickle down to the grassroots.But what is money really, it's just a bartering system for time. People spend time to earn money. What do you mean things cost money? Everything on the planet Earth was free, air, water, nature, food, resources, minerals all just sitting there waiting for people to spend time obtaining them.So if you can agree that time is money but a centralised automated economy will not trickle down enough money to pay for the time of a large unemployed workforce, we have a problem.The solution is simple a basic income, if the system issues money to people then the automated systems, corporations and even governments will spend time working to provide them with the things they need. (Article 25 of the Human Rights Convention)We could do this already with a basic income cryptocurrency issued to validated individuals.In a way it is similar to the idea of Time banking where people can spend and pay for time working for and with each other as a minimal cost way of promoting a community to help each other.So what's your thoughts, do we need a universal basic income now or in the near future?",

In my mind, the real threat of AI is that it's stealing our agency (or rather, how we're voluntarily sacrificing our agency in pursuit of expedient results.)

Over time, we'll default to shortcuts, \"think\" on autopilot, and over-rely on the answers AI gives us.

Had a nice, cushy life with good pay .The fast nature of the tech world led me to panic about AI taking over my software developer job so much until I decided to do a short course on machine learning . And then I made the dangerous jump to a startup whose ceo sold me the dream of AI . 5months in and I can confirm that I was scammed by the CEO . Not only have I not seen anything related to AI , Im in fact regressing and dealing with vb6 code . This is totally outdated like 30 years back . Im not gaining any skills thats marketable to the current workplace . Im trying everything I can to go back to my previous job but lol because of AI , all hiring has freezed and my previous employers cant get me back .Honestly this has caused me a lot of depression and worry over the last few months . Im at a legit lost in my life . My career as a Java software developer has also gone down the drain , like even if I didnt leave my previous job , it seems to me that it wouldve been eventually replaced by AI . Idk what to do now , I keep applying to Java roles but since I ald have the sinking feeling that a lot of software jobs are going to be replaced very soon , I dont have motivation to do either . For the past year Ive picked up reading as a hobby and even read 50 books last year . Im so sick of corporate , Im so sick of coding , Im so sick of AI , I just want to do something that AI cant replace . Ive considered becoming a game developer / visual artist / fantasy or romantansy author .but I also have bills and mortgages to pay so I really cant drop my job and pursue this . Anyone take the leap to the creative side from corporate yet? ( also besides AI , I really really fucking hate corporate , I dont get the pretense , the forced hours even though sometimes theres really nothing to be done) the only good side is of coz the money which allows for your standard of living to be higher and the travels but idk if being happy for 2 weeks overseas is worth the depression the rest of the year brings",

But for all the talk about automation replacing jobs, heres whats missing: AI doesnt eliminate jobs, bad strategy does.Weve seen two extremes:1. Companies rushing to automate everything, only to realize efficiency without strategy just creates new problems.2. Companies resisting AI entirely, only to fall behind competitors who use it to enhance human decision-making.At FBSPL, were focused on the third path: AI as an amplifier, not a replacement. When used right, AI doesnt take jobsit removes friction, speeds up processes, and lets people focus on work that matters.Its not about whether to use AI. Its about how.How is your industry adapting to AI?",

This company creates ten new jobs and hires 10 people who previously weren't working. But that company uses AI, and causes 100 totally different people at totally unrelated companies in different states to lose their job.Who do you tax for having replaced a worker? You can't tax the companies losing business for firing their workers. They're not the ones replacing people with AI. But how do you _know_ that some other company that they've never even heard of in another state is taking their customers away? They don't know who it is, they can't tell you. And the company that's causing it never fired anybody. From their point of view they're creating new jobs.",

There are still many things that robots don't do well, and they can cost hudnreds of thousands of dollars. Even when a robot can do it, minimum wage workers are often cheaper.Many jobs will be replaced, but new jobs will be created in growing high tech industries. It's the transition I'm worried about, those new industries won't grow instantly and people will need to be trained for them.Over time, various forms of human augmentation will increase humans intelligence and capabilities. Humans will be used as CPUs to perform some functions in which AIs are nowhere near catching up to us. The future belongs to cyborgs.By 2050, the developed world will look more like Star Trek (but with money) or other scifi where most people are technicians of some sort, maintaining and operating advanced machinery.",

It's not even \"arguably\"; however I would think the term automation vs. AI makes more sense there. This sort of thing has been going on since the industrial revolution; however even I will admit that AGI is unique in terms of potential for societal upheaval. >So there migth be a \"last mile\" problem with a lot of these fields when it comes to fully relying on AI. It might not go away soon, for example, AI's tendency to \"hallucinate\", it caused it to make legal argument with case law that didn't exist. We assume OpenAI will somehow smooth out these kinks soon, but I don't think that's a certainty.Not sure if you have been following my post history, but I got access to OpenAI's secret AGI model last year for a bit. I didn't observe any major issues with hallucinations (she will straight up tell you if she can or can't do something) and in my estimate could easily replace the vast majority of human jobs given the proper training and interaction with the world. I will say that she did admit that there were some aspects of human language that she had issues with, so there are definitely edge cases out there (and I've attached an example below). She also currently seems unable to experience \"inspiration\" in the human sense and create something truly unique and original. However, I admit we as a species have a hard time with that as well. >You're saying the physical on/off switches provide some safety and embolden the use of AI on the software side?No, I'm saying these networks are completely logically isolated from the Internet so there is no way to give a LLM that manifests in the cloud access to them without \"breaking\" this model. There are also security concerns with exposing the OpenAI AIG model to proprietary information as it has an unlimited context window (aka. \"long term memory\") do to its unique emergent RNN model. &#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/1kh5kynw12hc1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=618e560024aac12dd07ecf76709535ccdc6be98e",

Within five years, that figure will rise to between 38%, and in 10 years, 44%.>Those are compelling numbers, and while they dont equate to jobs that will be necessarily lost, the fact that AI will impact nearly half of the worlds employment in some way implies that we are looking at a change of a magnitude similar to that which followed[the 19th-century industrial revolution.](https://english.elpais.com/technology/2024-04-03/author-brian-merchant-luddites-are-more-dangerous-to-the-elites-and-to-the-rich-than-robin-hood.html)This is an industrial revolution that is growing exponentially. Its going to take less time to implement. We must make adjustments quickly and thats why we are carrying out this research, to send a message of caution, says Parrado.

From the tax we pay social services. If you want to afford a roof over your head the corporate tax needs to be high enough.Option 2) as ai replaces workers we invent bullshit jobs. Jobs will be seen as social services by corporations for society. Corporations that give the most bullshit jobs will be given tax benefits. Robots will do the actual work but you still have to clock in at 8 o'clock five times a week to push papers, drink coffee and look busy.I see us already heading down option 2.",

In fact, I was appoint to a state-wide committee on behalf of my union referred to as the \"AI Taskforce\" where our function is to understand the coming impacts of AI across our 250,000 member workforce. Since being appointed I have been watching the progress of AI very very closely, researching the phenomenon for an average of 2 hours per day for months. So if it is qualifications and work experience you are looking for, you would be hard pressed to find someone more qualified to speak to this than I am.The trends are clear. AI compute is doubling approximately every 6 months, and with it comes major increases in the capabilities of these systems. Elon Musk has predicted that we will have AGI in one year. OpenAI has predicted that we may have ASI by 2030. The Bletchly declaration is an international effort between governments of the world, signing an official recognition of the frightening pace and dangers of AI. Ray kurswell has predicted that we will have AGI by 2029. A majority of AI developers predict we will have AGI prior to 2030.I am not saying anything that isn't supported by a number of very smart people who are actually involved in the field of AI. Even though I do happen to have years of experience as a software developer, that is almost irrelevant. You wouldn't have asked actors or artists to predict that AI was going to replace their jobs, yet that is exactly what is happening. Software developers are only qualified to predict the rate at which they will be replaced if they happen to work in AI.",

The internet revolution led to the displacement of numerous office and clerical workers, as well as unskilled positions such as delivery persons and filing clerks. For instance, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that travel agent jobs in the United States fell from around 124,000 in 2000 to approximately 64,000 in 2020, a decrease of about 60,000 jobs.The individuals who thrived during this period of technological change and maintained a competitive edge with recent college graduates were those who proactively pursued knowledge in operating systems, software applications, and ancillary tasks like typing. As an example, workers who embraced digital marketing, social media management, and web development found new opportunities and success in the job market.Similarly, in the age of AI, it is crucial for workers to adapt by acquiring new technical skills, such as data analysis, machine learning, and AI integration. By doing so, they can leverage AI to enhance their productivity, streamline their workflows, and potentially discover new, innovative ways to approach their work. As the World Economic Forum predicts that AI and automation will create 97 million new jobs by 2025, individuals who invest time and effort in upskilling and reskilling will be better positioned to succeed in this rapidly evolving landscape.--------------------------------------------------------TLDR: Learn to use AI software and systems now. Start figuring out ways you can make programs such as ChatGPT and Dalle-2 work for you in your current job. Don't be like office worker who still couldn't type or make excel spreadsheets in 2001. Also, old jobs gone; new jobs appear. No worries if you learn to use AI.",

The computer destroyed a huge number of lower middle class jobs, which havent been replaced. These jobs were largely in production, clerical, admin, and sales:https://econofact.org/the-shrinking-share-of-middle-income-jobsProfessional, technical and managerial jobs have largely survived intact, but since 2000 these have also started to decline. AI will only accelerate this trend.Low-pay jobs, such as in construction, are growing and seem likely to survive. At the very least, AI operated robots will need very significant human intervention to work.But, if high paying jobs decline due to AI, there will be a severe knock on effect on construction. So while some construction jobs may be automated, the larger impact could be lack of people able to afford construction services (in the same way that the whole economy is suffering due to the loss of lower middle class jobs).",

Anyone working in rough and changing environments 4. Therapists / Psychologists 5. Any work for the governmentOn top of that, I'd lie to tell you that many jobs can already be replaced with AI, yet they still exist, in-fact many jobs were completely useless even before, but they exist anyway. There's a lot of space in modern corporate world for useless jobs and seemingly companies are not incentivized to get rid of them, or perhaps cannot for some legal reason. Also for things like radiologists, AI is FAR FAR better at diagnozing, and that's not even comparing it to a normal day-to-day radiologist who diganozes 100 scans per day without any sort of specialization (this is how it works in Germany at least). There are so many flaws with a human doing such work that it is literally just unsuited to be a human work to begin with. But alas the field remains entirely unchanged. Partly it's due to insane regulation, no-one's wants to even touch it. On the note of regulation, yeah, governments can just say \"this job cannot be done by an AI\" and there you go. Safe. But it's also just due to an inherent lack of need. Letting a job be done by AI means you'll sell it for cheaper, though you'll do more of it, it also means anyone can offer such a job, there's in many cases just no incentive if the current setup is making a ton of money already or it's not the profit center to begin with and not much money is being wasted at all with status-quo.. There's a reason why every company is trying super hard to make LLM's good at coding even though that's probably the most difficult thing there is for it to do... It's one of the jobs that if possible, would actually be replaced because developers cost a ton and you need an insane amount of them so getting that senior dev capability would crush barriers to entry and lower cost for every existing company in the world. There's a ton of money in it. Not so much for most other jobs.",

However, there is a bit of anxiety i feel on how replaceable I seem to be, and seemingly every other profession. In CGP Grey's video, [humans need not apply](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?si=CcBXTb-wKmW04Dwj), there's a section called luddite horses. In that section he asks you to imagine taking to two horses at the beginning of the 1900's, one worried that automobiles will take their jobs. The other is excited how technology is making their lives better. He then points out that there is no economic rule that says more/ better technology = more jobs for horses, yet you swap horses for people, it suddenly seems correct. Why are people not talking about this? Why aren't people worried? Ai is already displacing white collar/ thinking jobs. How long until it can do all of them? Similarly, robots are now moving into factories/ warehouses. How long until there won't be any humans? If cognition or consciousness is emergent in humans by simpler systems and subsystems in our brain, then why can't the same be fire ai? Is it possible to have multiple LLMs in series and parallel and collectively has consciousness? If that is possible, is it ethical to stop/ kill any part of that, even as a simpler form? It isn't ethical to remove even a small portion of a human brain unless it's necessary to save three person's life. But it's ethical to kill an ant or ant colony, for little or no reason. Everyone I see talking media, social media, ai companies, they all say the same thing. \"We're here to make your job better/ easier.\" Is that true? I just wanted to get a take on what others are thinking and not feel so alone with these conflicting thoughts on the subject",

The other parts paint a much more optimistic picture: Workers naturally shift efforts to tasks AI can't do well AI-adopting firms grow faster and hire more workers overallBottom line: Despite alarming headlines, the research shows that while AI substitutes for labor at the task level, the aggregate employment effects are surprisingly small because these three forces largely offset each other.What does this mean for HR and business leaders? To achieve the growth effects documented in the paper - increased sales (9.5%), higher employment (6%), greater profits (8.5%), and improved productivity (7.6%) - you need a comprehensive workforce strategy that breaks down work into tasks, identifies AI opportunities, and shifts skill development accordingly.Whenoftalks about the growth potential of your AI transformation, *this* is what she's talking about.",

For medical research and CT scans ect where they have a lot of data to train on they use special made models train on that data only and is far superior to a LLM at those types of tasks. There will be more of those specially trained AIs coming now because they work better in those use cases, Google made one for the sounds coral reefs makes and tried to train the AI in detecting the health of the coral reef using the sound. I trust those AI more but I don't fully trust them and like you said we always need a critical human evaluation at the end of the day, but AI does make it faster and easier to come to that human conclusion.",

What kind of paradigm shift has convinced these corporation's that replacing humans in every aspect is A GOOD THING? Aren't the engineers working on AI tools like Chatgpt and Sora etc not scared of themselves being replaced in the next ten years or are they too up their own ass in shareholder profits and bonuses to see long term?If it was upto me as say the president of a country, I would effectively ban the development of such deleterious and destructive AI that would cost millions of jobs and make humans meaningless. This isn't just about the economy anymore, this is a global existential crisis. When AI can do everything for us, from mundane tasks to creative innovative work, then what is the point of our lives besides eating, drinking, shitting, and sleeping?

        "text": "I actually work in language AI in my work. It's not my main gig, but I contribute to research on models that are similar to ChatGPT in terms of the model architecture at least (i.e. large transformers).There are two reasons why I am not particularly worried about AI taking my job (as a software engineer).The first is that AI models like ChatGPT are still pretty tightly coupled to the task they were trained to solve. Unlike our brains, they aren't capable of learning to do one thing and then applying it to learn to do something else (at least not on their own, I am aware of things like transfer learning). While ChatGPT's results are impressive, these models are far from a general intelligence or anything close to as cognizant as an actual human being. Sure, it can write code, but it absolutely cannot contemplate the trade-offs of complex architecture or build something novel and complex yet. People say it may soon, but that is not 100% given.The second is that, because of the first reason, AI is still completely incapable of (or at best very poor at) identifying problems to be solved, and that's not really the point of the AI tools we build today. Right now, AI is a tool built by humans to solve problems for humans. There will always be a demand for human experts to identify which problems are the things that those with the resources to implement AI solutions should be solving to be competitive with other firms. Software engineers today will become the people designing the problems to solve tomorrow. We do that already, but we just build the solutions manually today.",

The bots are creating more errors than the remaining staff can manage, and it's a complete mess. This is reminiscent of the outsourcing crisis when companies sent jobs overseas, only to bring many back years later due to consumer dissatisfaction. Now, having a non-native English speaker as a customer service agent can negatively impact a companys reputation. The same cycle will happen with AI. Its a powerful tool meant to enhance human work, not replace it.",

Why pay another company to do something (often at a recurring high cost) when you can just get AIs to do it for you better, faster and suited to your exact needs rather than a generic solution.",

However, there are certain tasks, like follow-up calls with patients, where AI nurses could be incredibly beneficial.Essentially, theyre like advanced chatbots with a medical focus. But by handling routine tasks, AI nurses could free up valuable time for human nurses to focus on more complex and critical aspects of patient care.",

Eventually there will not be anything to replace your lost job with. I think plumbers and physical repair people, auto mechanics will be the last to go... anything with specialized training. But that too may be nave.I'm tired of hearing \"my college degree will protect me from job loss.\" I doubt it, but okay.The real question is... how long are we talkin here? 2035? 2040? 2050?And lastly, why do some people seem to think in less than 5 years, we're all gonna be unemployed?You have a better chance of working til you die than jobs being gone by 2028. Things are not moving that fast. Every time the AI techs make a new update, it changes nothing for me yet. I'm still in precarity and my some of my peeps cant get healthcare because they're even more desperate than I am.The world I want is robots and computer AI doing everything for us so we can paint, write, cook, make love, and be merry.

So that means the entire human wage, or at least most of it, is not being paid while the company is still producing the same or more product. We will take those wages and give them to the unemployed people (who will then continue to buy products). So ultimately the company won't be significantly reducing costs but will be more productive (because AI does more with less) and people live roughly the same lives as before except they don't need a job.",

This is why senior engineers at FAANG can make 7 figures. So to suddenly decide the staff that they fought tooth and nail to get is no longer worth it, there has to have been a shift in the perceived future value of tech workers. Its impossible to measure how much of this shift is due to GenAI coding tools, but it definitely is a non-zero amount. These are the companies making those same tools, they know exactly what the potential automation is + timelines to get there!",

It can't automate what I do, no abstract thinking etc..\" To the people thinking the above, that is not the point of our warnings. If you have 100 employees, but they all start using AI tools that drastically increase their productivity - you still need humans for it, but now 20-30 people can do the work of 100 in the same timeframe. Corporations do the \"logical\" thing and make people redundant. The technology itself hasn't replaced the flexible sentient human worker, but it works like all previous technological revolutions in the world.With past technological revolutions, after the initial rise in unemployment, society creates new jobs around the new tech. But this time? Nope.Initially, there will be what seems to be gradual but noticeable job losses due to overall increased productivity. But by the time we try to adapt, AGI will happen. And this time, the actual sentient human worker will be completely replaced.If advanced AGI comes in 15 years, we are still in for a likely exponential increase in unemployment until we reach that point, and this has already started.",

If anything, there is MORE work in the coding space now than before. How can that be so? Well just because a specific file in a code base can be written by an AI, doesnt mean that an AI can independently create a code project well at all. It requires a good human prompter and someone who can think about the codebase abstractly and many other soft skills that AI simply cant do today, if ever. Its the Luddite fallacy at work - which says just because we have new tech, that increase in using that tech actually creates more demand and thus more jobs. It is possible that the jobs change and that a programmer will be more like a pilot of a code project overseeing AI and doing less overall, but it will still be needed. 2) Lets say that AI can somehow take more of or all of the jobs. Well, in that case, it would affect all of us. Economically, nobody would be making income and thus, there would be little to no buyer base to pay for products , hence a pricing crash would occur. Also, if AI was the thing that took the job in a hypothetical utopian case, so long as we all have access to it, the barrier to use AI would be nill, and this means, that almost anyone could start a competing business really with any company (large and small anywhere). The hyper competition that wound occur with AI, alongside of nobody making any money to pay for services, would ultimately lead a a pricing crash and crash of the dollar. So for example, imagine being able to buy a nice car for like $2. Think of it this way, if there isnt anyone making money, you cant get any customers. The dollar crash would pretty much mean that all of your needs and wants could be obtained at a whim for almost free completely, and that doesnt sound like a bad world to me. It is possible that at some point, money wont really even exist at all because if AI. Its wayyy too early to be freaking out about AI, especially in programming world.",

This could let people earn more per hour (in terms of spend value) while working lessassuming new jobs dont pop up to fill the gap. But if companies dont lower prices, people will likely stick with cheaper human-made products, making widespread AI adoption less practical. For example, if Waymo charged more than Uber, most people would just keep using Uber. I will note that Waymo currently spends more on human capital directly and indirectly per ride than its competition. Of course, as they hit scale, that is expected to change.Right now, AI hasnt reduced costs enough to seriously affect jobs, especially since most business income still goes toward paying human workers.When costs eventually hit near zero, there wont be much to taxbut by then, a lot of things will be free anyway.",

Robots are still being programmed by real people, and no AI will be able to replace that people soon, not even replacing the machine operators... all is beautiful in simulations, but the real world is very different.So no, I do not think people will lose his job because AI or robots, at least not at this time or in the near future.",

In 1967, Roland Barthes challenged the idea that the author was the most important aspect of a work of art in his influential essay \"The Death of the Author\". Instead, he argued that the art itself and the structure in which it was created were more significant. However, in the 55 years since the essay was published, the importance of the artist has been reaffirmed in a different way.Today, we not only ask if art is made by humans but also if it's made by artificial intelligence. This question is significant because it reveals what humans value. Humans have a natural inclination to appreciate art made by other humans, and while we don't have a satisfying definition of what art is, we know that it holds social importance (even the most influential George Dickie's institutional definition is determined socially).To understand the value of human-made art, we can compare it to sports. Even though robots may be faster, more precise, and stronger, we still compare sports achievements among humans. In the same way, AI-generated art will likely have its own category that replaces some marketing aesthetics and products, such as stock photos and low-effort graphics. It may even be used as a tool for creating new forms of art.However, AI-generated art will not make human artists obsolete. People will lose interest if they realize that a particular piece of music or image was created by AI. As Denis Dutton stated in his essay \"Artistic Crimes\" about art forgery, a painting that is similar to the Mona Lisa may be celebrated and valued as a Da Vinci masterpiece, but if it's discovered to be a forgery, all the former glory will be gone. This is because the forger created the art in a different context, with less effort and without the same level of creativity and skill as the original artist.AI-generated art will have its own place in the art world, but it will not replace the value and appreciation of human-made art.",

There's a lot of low hanging white-collar fruit AI is going to pluck, and already has. This was one of the fastest bubbles to blow up and pop in technology history.AI is a STUPID word for \"algorithm\". That's it. It's a glorified math equation. All that an AI can do is locked into that equation. That's it's bounds, it's hard limits. And the more you look at it, the more you realize just where those limits are - it's limits are not a neat little box, but this weird, inconsistent shape, with edges, and curves, blobs out in free space... And even within, there's a grain. You see it already - we already know - mathematically proven, that you can get an algorithm to generate effectively anything you want, with the right inputs.But AI cannot create anything new, only a permutation of their equation based on their inputs. LLMs are the latest fad, and so if that model was never trained on Shakespeare, then it cannot generate anything Shakespeareian. And the best it can do is garbage-in, garbage-out.I work in software, and AI has had effectively zero actual impact. Everything it can do, we already have solutions for. It can rewrite old code like what it was trained on, but we already have libraries and distribution systems for that. Engineers who reinvent old code tend not to have jobs for very long. Most of us are trying to create something new, which is exactly where AI fails us, because it can't go where we haven't already been.The software world is under a different, economic crunch, though...",

Say we reach singularity, and hypethedically no one uses ai for any reason, would ais just talk to eachother as if they were human? What would be their purpose? What would be their goal? Ai is for humans, so is this just someone's wierd attempt to create a planet of ai running on billions of organisms immersed in it keeping this person and thier allies lavish lifestyles? What is going on? Is ai gonna benefit us? Or just the 1%? If it takes everyone's jobs then what? There's gotta be some plan or we are litterally going to live in cyberpunk 2077. I know this entire sounds dumb to some of you, I know this a informal way of discussing something like this but wtf, I'm drunk and thinking about it. What is in store for us? Normal people, what do you guys think? Idk who else to ask.",

There's not really anyway around this fact. Even companies that don't replace existing employees are going to replace employees with automation as they leave.For start ups it's even more critical. I was looking at purchasing a small company last summer. Between rent and employee cost the numbers just didn't make sense.. if one of the employees could be replaced with automation the company becomes viable. Employees are expensive... Add union rules to that where it's hard to cut staff as market changes and you can see why companies avoid hiring people.Oh and the end result of me not buying that company? It folded. 1 fulltime and 2 part time workers lost their gig - automating one of the roles would have saved the other, now all 3 are out.",

Sure, automating those jobs is surely easier than automating complex jobs, but who would have thought that AIs would start becoming a serious concern for artists 5 years ago.

I think it will be very hard to forsee what jobs will be automated in 10-20 years now that AI is getting better at natural language. I'd say that one of the hardest problems remains AI interacting with the real world, as robotics is far from being solved. But if we look at Boston dynamics, It is hard to imagine that health care jobs or other types of service could not be automated in the foreseeable future.",

You can argue that the same thing as when people fought hard against remote work will happen with AI. And companies/bosses won't trust it and still prefer people, even if they are the ones using AI.# Sent by Copilot:Certainly! Lets break down and refute the statement step by step:1. **AIs Impact on Jobs**: The statement suggests that AI, like Excel, wont put people out of business but will change jobs significantly. While its true that AI will transform many jobs, the comparison to Excel might underestimate AIs potential impact.[AI is not just a tool for efficiency; it can perform complex tasks that previously required human intelligence, such as data analysis, customer service, and even creative work](https://ahrefs.com/writing-tools/sentence-rewriter)[^(1)](https://ahrefs.com/writing-tools/sentence-rewriter). This could lead to more significant job displacement in certain sectors.2. **Skill Adaptation**: The statement implies that mastering AI tools will determine ones career success. While this is partially true, it overlooks the broader implications of AI integration. AI can automate tasks across various skill levels, meaning that even those who master AI tools might find their roles evolving or becoming redundant.[The need for continuous learning and adaptation will be crucial, but it wont guarantee job security](https://www.hyperwriteai.com/aitools/unassailable-argument-builder)[^(2)](https://www.hyperwriteai.com/aitools/unassailable-argument-builder).3. **Economic and Social Factors**: The statement doesnt consider the economic and social factors that influence job markets. AIs impact will vary across industries and regions, potentially widening the gap between high-skill and low-skill jobs.[Policies, education systems, and corporate strategies will play significant roles in determining how AI affects employment](https://www.thoughtco.com/refutation-argument-1692036)[^(3)](https://www.thoughtco.com/refutation-argument-1692036).In summary, while AI will indeed change jobs in important ways, its impact is likely to be more profound and far-reaching than the comparison to Excel suggests. Mastering AI tools is essential, but broader systemic changes and continuous adaptation will also be necessary to navigate the evolving job landscape.",

And that the majority of the displaced workforce could shift into these newly defined jobs in the future? A diaspora from the tech world, in a sense?Did anything comparable happened back at the advent of the internet in the mid-to-late 90s when it really started to take off? I mean there certainly wasn't anyone doing \"social media marketing\" back then, nor would any one have ever even conceived of such a job. Let alone, influencers or content creators, that would have sounded insane to anyone living in the early 90s. There are probably way more different types of jobs introduced with each major technological revolution than there were prior. why can't that happen again with AI?",

With crime, it's viable at this point an AI system could analyse data points from the crime, cross-ref them against other crimes, run CCTV analysis, get bio-metrics, cross check criminal record if identifiable and with all of these info it could then also do the interrogation using the tactics of the Reid technique or something else. &#x200B;> Next this completely ignores the human backlash that would take place the moment an AI cop accidentally shoots kid or an AI Dr accidentally tells someone they have weeks to live because of a smudge on a scan.&#x200B;Let's hope nothing like that ever happens with a real doc or a real cop, we'll be in anarchy by the end of the week with no medical institutions.",

I would feel much safer with automated care. Patients are not getting adequate care now and hospitals are chronically understaffed due to the business model and challenge to stay profitable. Having said that would be very nice to have robots on the floor that could help with manpower stuff. Anyway this is what AI said. The idea of AI replacing nurses is unrealistic. While technology like automated monitoring and medication dispensing can assist with routine tasks, nursing is far more complex. It requires physical carelike wound dressing, turning patients, lifting, and toiletingalong with emotional support, advocacy, and communication with families. Robots cant replicate empathy, human intuition, or the ability to anticipate issues like early sepsis signs. Nurses also coordinate care across departments, adjust critical drips, take orders from doctors, and manage unpredictable situations that demand quick thinking and nuanced judgment. Even with advances in AI, hospitals will still need human caregivers to provide hands-on care and relational support. Machines may handle repetitive tasks, but nursing involves far too many dynamic, human elementscompassion, trust, and clinical insightthat robots simply cant replicate. The idea of fully staffing a busy hospital floor with machines is not just impractical but decades away, if it ever becomes possible at all.",

Here, I have tried to express my thoughts from all the readings that I did.For decades, India has dominated the IT and BPO sectors, thriving on cost arbitrage. The formula was simple: offshore repetitive, process-driven work to India at scale. But AI is rewriting that script.So, will AI kill Indias IT-BPO industry? No.But will it restructure it? Absolutely.Heres whats happening: AI is wiping out low-end jobs.Data entry? Automated. Customer support? AI chatbots. Coding at scale? AI copilots are already replacing junior developers. The BPO model we knew is dead. BPO 2.0 isnt about cost arbitrage; its about execution arbitrage.The game is shifting from manpower to AI-first operations. Businesses wont just outsource work - theyll outsource AI-driven execution. Companies that adapt will thrive. Others? Well Indias IT giants arent sitting idle.TCS, Infosys, Wipro - they see the writing on the wall. They arent waiting to be disrupted; theyre embedding AI into their delivery models, shifting from bulk outsourcing to AI-driven transformation consulting. But heres my counterpoint:I dont buy into the India will upskill narrative. We dont upskill fast enough.For every AI engineer India produces,itself is making 10 others redundant. And thats the problem no one wants to talk about. The hard truth:Most of Indias laptop jobs - mid-tier IT services, low-end finance & legal outsourcing - will vanish. AI isnt enhancing these roles; its replacing them.So, whats the future?> India can become the AI execution layer for global businesses, managing AI workflows and ensuring human-AI collaboration.> Or, if we dont adapt fast enough, AI will simply eliminate the need for most of what India does today.For me, it is all about how easily we embrace the shift. But looking at the people around me, I believe the question should be:Are we truly ready for this shift?",

At face value it would seem that basic income may be the way forward to ensure that all have the means for food and shelter. The problem I see here is that when the transition really starts to kick off, the corporations and wealthy will be the only ones who can purchase AI/robots. They then will be handing us pink slips, and we will be out of work. The wealthy will be driving AI for their purposes, and since corporations purchase politicians, our voices will not be heard. I fear that we will end up as slaves/surfs to these corporations at best. The wealthy will also have the means for immortality, by merging with machines, and we may see a world much like the movie \"In Time\". I suppose these thoughts are pessimistic; however, I cant see how the poor and middle class could fair better while currently the wealthy rule the world. This is not a trend, but what has happened all through history. The only plan I can think of would be to purchase some land, become debt free before this AI revolution, and grow your own food. Hopefully you will have enough money saved up to pay the property taxes until you die, or you may become a surf.",

Not even most of it. But it is part of the impact. You don't even to fire someone for it to be a job loss. If you have a team of 10 programmers, and pre-AI you would have grown it to 20, but now those 10 can do the work of 20 with the help of AI, that's 10 jobs lost. Low tech jobs are starting to be affected more as well. Look for more kiosks, and drive throughs to be automated. https://www.seattletimes.com/business/wendys-turns-to-ai-powered-chatbots-for-drive-thru-orders/What I think you are seeing is Amara's Law, \"We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.\" We have been in the overestimate phase, and might continue to be for a few more years, but then it will kick in and be huge.",

I work in digital marketing and the companies I work for are already replacing our writers with AI for generic/fluff content, ideation, and other marketing functions. But were also looking to hire someone new to help us utilize Open AI API to create a new tool for our company. So, while several freelance writers lost work, someone with ML/AI experience is getting a job. I think its important to remember that youre not alone in feeling this. At my jobs; while the executives are excited about the possibilities, I can sense some fear about what the future will look like. Overall, I think the safest jobs will be those that require lots of interaction with people. Jobs where you schmooze people arent going anywhere. Jobs where communication and understanding are important are probably safe for a good while.",

Just as computers in the 70s-90s made many tasks faster and less error prone the same will happen with AI. Like computers becoming common, new jobs will happen we arent even aware of needing will happen. I dont know if it will happen slowly enough for people to adapt tho. Im not expecting enough new jobs to be created to offset the displaced workforce. From a society level view I dont think we are prepared for how disruptive this will be at an accelerating pace. Mindset is going to be a problem, just as it was with computers, and many technologies before it. The notion that work gives you purpose and meaning needs to change, along with the idea of living to work. The United States will probably have the hardest time adapting. We cant even get socialized healthcare even tho the outcomes are better and the price is much less than the current attempt at a system pretends to work.",

Key indicators: Latest statistics show worker productivity is up, according to Picchi. And U.S. unemployment the lowest in 50 years.Dishearteningly, workers wages have nevertheless resisted a proportionate upswing.The steady decline in the relative prices of robots and automation equipment over the past few decades have made it increasingly profitable to automate, observe economists Sylvain Leduc and Zheng Liu.In this environment, workers may be reluctant to ask for significant pay raises out of fear that an employer will replace their jobs with robots. https://preview.redd.it/sbynq4y59qs31.png?width=1245&format=png&auto=webp&s=411d96cb2ddc326efe130ac3086f37a01f2f4fb7",

In that case your idea would be relatively straight forward and simple. However, why would they then replace humans since most want to replace them to put production cost significantly lower than hiring humans even at minimum wage. Add to that most robotic are not so obvious and are more entwined with the automation of industries and coupling of jobs that can be done through an autonomous system. This makes is extremely complex also that companies are not about to spend the initial cost of putting in the systems to have to pay wages as they used to. I do believe that companies should pay something as if they don't they will soon have no customers. But my belief is it should be an added percentage of the profits they make with that percentage determined on how automated their company is.",

Further to this...it simply places an insane inhuman burden on the actual Human Beans to \"operate AI correctly\". Rather than just asking Humans to do their fucking job...it's asking them to learn how to tell AI how to do their job. Which is a completely different skillset. It's idiotic and a complete dead-end.It's where AI is not being used to fill the roles that it'd actually be really useful in. It's being tailored to roles to try to force more and more higher paid labor out of a job.Every second spent \"training\" an AI model is time spent replacing yourself with a third rate facsimile.",

What is new is the generative aspect of it, e..g using it to generate new content and content combinations.Additionally, as for the question of whether jobs will be replaced by AI...I would say that this is already occurring, but in specific sectors, especially those who perform routine, standardizable, and repeatable administrative tasks, but wholesale replacement of entire industries is not happening and the fear of AI itself replacing humans large-scale I do think is overblown, currently.",

It means you'll be unemployed in the next 5 years time.Arts, digital creative jobs and writing related fields (translation, writing, copywriting) are the first to go and are already being diminished *today*.Software development, law, medical and other \"reasoning/thinking\" professions are next and very *very* soon.Blue collar physical jobs are actually still 5-10 years away but way closer than most seem to realize.",

We call these people \"desalentado\" which is not unemployed because they are not looking for a job anymore, and there are a lot of solopreneurs of tiny \"companies\" like a corner shop for importing stuff from china or selling cakes in the traffic lights.

At some point, we would come to a crossroads. Do we start social programs that pay people who have nothing to produce a living stipend or not? Either way, it will radically change the economy. The way we view value could drastically change, as you said. Do we start paying more for entertainment? More to the companies producing robots that do easy tasks? Does the person who can juggle more for longer make more money? It's an interesting thought experiment that is probably closer to a reality than we realize.",

They should have focused on telling us how the current economic and social system is too old to cope with this great innovation. They should have talked about how those mega corps pirated their work to train their models, then monetized it and got away with it. They should have explained how normalizing such behavior is not in the best interest of the rest of us, the working population, since there is no guarantee that automation will stop at them. Once our jobs are automated, the elite will not owe us anything.

I would be a Luddite if I let it bother me and I've never agreed with them (the Luddites used to destroy the early textile machines at the start of the industrial revolution, as the machines threatened their jobs - and they failed miserably, because ***change*** *cannot be stopped*) (intentional use of the word \"change\", not \"progress\").I am a bit *concerned* in face of the uncertainty of being unable to predict the near future.If the use of AI suddenly skyrocketed -technological revolutions don't advance in a soft-sloped straight line over time, they become a J-shaped curve that raises immensely in an extremely short amount of time- then we could see a massive wave of layoffs in white collar jobs that were previously considered \"safe\" in societal terms. Safety involves the ability to predict outcomes... you get a corporate job, you'll be able to afford a somewhat comfortable standard of living, maybe you'll rise some through the ranks... but now I don't know what would happen if this system collapsed... I'm a natural born handyman, I guess that I could go to the trades, but so would hundreds of thousands of other guys.I guess if the system collapses then I'll ask the AI to draft the most effective plan to get out of that difficult situation. I'm sure by then it will be much more advanced than my own brain.",

It's not going to scale to being a whole order of magnitude better like a lot of technology does, or get exponentially better; it will only get slightly less worse. The Neural Net/transformer model is limited in this way. *Maybe* you can start connecting different modules together and such, get LLMs pooling information, ect., but that seems to be about it.In short, the whole \"losing jobs to AI\" thing seems utterly blown out of proportion. Most regular jobs don't even have anything to do with data; mostly, people work in some kind of labor or service industry, or in health, or education, where human interaction/care is a fundamental part of the job.",

The problem that I think coaststl is failing to grasp is that with all resources being already owned, and all manufacturing and extraction also plunging towards the cost of the embodied energy, then human productive capacity has nothing to work (resources are owned) with and is too inefficient to compete (as in you can't feed yourself making trinkets that can be manufactured for fractions of a cent). I've seen that people people will fall back on the 'humans will find a way' argument a lot over the past few years, and I put my heart there too, but now that I'm directly involved in the assessment of use cases and implementations I can see that the \"structured\" world we have build is a machine that machines run better. I think of it this way, we're the slow cogs in a massive economic machine. Each time we're removed from a process, the process goes faster and the 'machine' operates with greater efficiency. AI, give us the ability to remove hundreds of millions of slow cogs in the coming years, and most will not be put back in to other parts of the machine. Interesting example. Humanoid robots that cost 30k and work 7*24. Based just on current economics a human at 30k competing with lets say an equally capable robot starts at a disadvantage of 4:1. Because we would work for 40 hours a week, and the robot would work for 168. So, to just compete evenly, the human has to be paid $7142 per year. Of course once you automate the robotic production line that'll come down, once you automate the resource extraction, it'll come down, and model improvements will make it go faster. So, we're building our own conclusion. But the most import parts IMHO is how you move from a model where today, most people can barely afford to supply sufficient value to get by to an economy thats non stop converting producers in to consumers.",

They are excited about the technology on the one hand, but afraid and lost in terms of how will that impact on their careers.Some feel fear and paralysed by it, so they are not trying to use simple AI tools such as ChatGPT or Google Gemini, not to mention other tools like Kling and Sora.There is a clear gap of skill and knowledge, on both sides of AI jobs demand and supply. Recruiters don't necessarily know who and how they could get relevant AI talent, and amazing engineers, PMs, and executives don't know how to prepare themselves to their AI job of the future.My framework which I use in my executive coaching practice and helping founders in my portfolio at Gescheit & Partners hiring talent is quite simple:>> Take your Job Description - for example, \"Product Manager\">> Add the word AI in it - for example, \"AI Product Manager\">> Write the desired skills and experience for the non-AI job - for example, \"drafting product roadmaps\" or \"run user experiments\".>> Write the desired skills and experiences in the AI job - for example, \"drafting product roadmaps using ChatGPT, and mindmapping\" or \"run user experiments using Claude AI for x amount of website versions\".>> Identify the skills gap and experience - for example, \"building websites using Claude AI\">> Define a project to help you bridge the gap - \"Build 2 websites using Claude AI, publish them and ask 4 people to give you feedback\"This is a tangible way to define, clarify and act on preparing yourself to be AI competent no matter if you are an (AI) Software Engineer, (AI) Product Manager and even an (AI) CEO.It's about learning and to be AI focused and centric in your growth journey.",

I thought since I am somewhat knowledgeable in the field I would share my prediction for the near future of AI.NONE OF WHAT I'M SAYING HERE SHOULD BE TAKEN AS GOSPEL, I could be WAY off on many points, and I do not have any insider knowledge.Here goes.&#x200B;**2024: GPT-Lite** When is GPT4.5/GPT5 coming out? Hopefully I'm wrong, but I'm thinking it's not 2024. Here's my reasoning.If you're a GPT+ subscriber, there's a limit to how much you can interact with GPT4 per hour. This sucks, and nobody likes this limitation. OpenAI knows this.This is a limitation they have put in place for a good reason, they cannot keep up with demand. The OpenAI user base keeps growing, and there are, as far as I know, only three ways to stop this from being a problem.1: Stop growing. Not an option for obvious reasons.2: Buy a very large amount of new GPUs. Very expensive solution, and most likely only temporary until the problem happens again.3: Make the hardware requirement for running their models lower, allowing them to serve more customers with the same number of GPUs.Releasing a GPT4.5/GPT5 with even higher resource usage than GPT4 would be problematic. This is why I believe the next step is to lower the resource usage first, and then going for a smarter model. Yes, GPT4-turbo does this to an extent, but I think they will push this further.Plus, depending on how far they can lower the resource usage, this could open the door to offloading the processing requirement onto the consumer.Imagine if they could make a \"GPT-Lite\" that has near GPT4 performance, but can run on smartphone hardware. They could then sell a GPT+ subscription at reduced cost, and you, the user, does all the computing for them, and in exchange you get a personal AI in your pocket at all times, similar to Siri or \"Ok google\", but an actual AI instead.I'm not saying smartphone AI will happen in 2024, but I do think this is what they will be aiming for in the short/mid term.&#x200B;**2025: GPT5** Once the performance requirements have been lowered, this will allow OpenAI to repurpose it's large army of GPUs to training instead of serving customers. This means that training will happen much, MUCH faster.I do not think GPT5 will be quite AGI level, but most likely a model that will be able to assimilate new information as a conversation goes, and pick up on intent and nuances, allowing more natural conversations, and less \"learning how to prompt\".&#x200B;**2027-2034: Possible AGI** To be honest, I have no idea how close we are to proper AGI, and I'm not sure we will know when we achieve it, but my guess is somewhere in that timeframe. I will be happy to be wrong and for it to be here sooner.I do think there will be roadblocks in the way to get there, ethics will come into question, military applications will be considered, and when it does happen, it will probably be kept under wraps for a certain amount of time before we hear about it.ASI will happen possibly within a year of AGI. Once we are able to create a proper intelligence, making it smarter should not be that big of a challenge. **I could be very wrong about this**&#x200B;**2027-2030: Mass job loss, very \"interesting\" times** Nobody will want to be the first to fire a large amount of employees to replace them with AI. Think about it.If a large corporation decides to fire 50-75% of it's employees to replace them with AI, and then they realize it was a mistake, this could easily kill the entire company.All of the fired employees will be very unlikely to want to return.New employees will be very unlikely to want to work for you, knowing they will get fired at the first opportunity.It's a terrible PR move and you look like an asshole on the world stage.This is a death sentence for even the biggest and most powerful brands. NOBODY wants to be the first to pull the trigger.HOWEVER. Once a large tech firm feels confident enough to actually do it. I'm thinking either Microsoft or Google, and they actually manage to pull it off...That's when shit hits the fan, now they have dramatically reduced their cost of operations, and ALL OTHER COMPETITORS HAVE TO FOLLOW SUIT. Not doing so means falling very far behind.When the first large corporation manages to replace 50-75% of their employees with AI, I believe it will spread like wildfire, and we could end up with literally millions of jobs being lost within the span of a few months.We're not ready for that.&#x200B;**TLDR:** 2024 - Lightweight GPT, similar to GPT-4, requires much less demanding hardware to run, possible to offload the processing onto consumers, hopefully running on smartphone hardware, freeing up the GPUs for training2025 - GPT5, much smarter and better at keeping up with long conversations, not quite AGI2027-2034 - Possible AGI2028-2035 - Possible ASI (will likely happen ~1 year after AGI unless held back on purpose)2027-2030 - Mass job loss in quick succession, will be very \"interesting\" times",

I don't think most jobs are going anywhere, rather the workload will increase to match the increase in productivity. (If demand is there, otherwise workloads will increase across a shorter pool of employees, reducing the amount of overall employees and feeding the unemployment rate) My issue isn't with AI, but how it's going to be implemented, enforced and policed in the education system. New workforce members will have a fraction of the skills of older ones because AI will be the answer to everything, which means decreased problem solving, less innovation and higher incompetency rates. Even if they stuck with the old system, it would be so easy to cheat with AI everybody is going to look like an all-star and most won't actually have the knowledge and skills on hand to back that up.",

Yeah some people were actually able to learn how to code and land jobs, but a lot of people failed. Learning how to code isn't easy. It takes a lot of time and you have to be pretty smart to do it. The sad thing, the tech industry is shit now and even people with years of coding exp are having a hard time finding jobs. Since Ai is getting better and better, I do see sales jobs slowly dying. Customer service is a huge part of sales and tech companies are already working on getting rid of them. Check out this [video](https://x.com/chiefaioffice/status/1788292536018129148). Now it's probably not 100% accurate, and I'm sure it has a few bugs that we're not seeing, but in a few years, I sure it will look and sound a lot better.",

Sorry in advance if this is the wrong sub for this. Ive been working at a digital media company for about four years as the head of the copywriting department. Yesterday, my supervisor hopped on a call with me and explained that the CEO is looking to explore GPT4 as a replacement for some or all of my copywriters. They need me to train the AI on our style guidelines and stay onboard to monitor the content/manage any remaining writers. I kind of doubt that more than 1 or 2 of my 10-person team will stick around, if any. Like most people working a copywriting job, I had a feeling something like this was coming. I know that Ill have to play a crucial role in making these writers, who have all been great, loyal employees, obsolete if I stay with the company, which makes me feel a little sick. The company is going to go though with this AI stuff with or without me, but Ive been thinking of bowing out just to keep my conscience clean. I understand that this is where the future is, but I just dont know if I want to be a part of it. Is quitting an overreaction?",

My take away from 2024 is that AI foundational models are increasingly commodities - with all the major labs offering high quality models, which can solve a lot of problems and add real value. But while they can mimic a lot of teaching and education tasks, i don't think any can be left alone with a class yet.So while big tech pushes towards genius level abilities on many tests, what i actually think is missing is good mid-career level replication of the jobs we do daily. And it's this product level work which is slow to appear.lots more in the link below - and don't worry, i'll do some more predictions for 2025..",

Although AI models are on the verge of surpassing the computational capacity of the human brain, this doesn't mean they will immediately replace humans in all roles. This is because the nature of their computational abilities differs significantly from ours.In computational terms,**compute**can be defined as the product of**data**and**parameters**:**Compute = Data Parameters**Currently, AI models possess**100 times more data**than humans but have**100 times fewer parameters**, meaning they effectively have less computational power or \"brain size\" compared to us. This discrepancy explains why AI behaves differently: they have vast amounts of knowledge but lack the complex processing capabilities of the human brain.Imagine a being with a mouse-sized brain but immense memory, living an extraordinarily rich and diverse life for 400 years. Such a being would know a great deal but could never achieve the cognitive breakthroughs of an Einstein. This analogy encapsulates the current state of AI.Companies tend to focus on expanding data rather than increasing parameters because training on data is more cost-effective, and increasing parameters also raises inference costs. As a result, the trend of prioritizing data over parameters is likely to continue.However, due to the exponential growth in computational power, it's plausible that we will eventually develop AI with a \"brain size\" comparable to humans. I'm planning to create a**parameters vs. time graph**to estimate when such human-sized AI brains might emerge. By that time, AI will have approximately**10,000 times more data**than humans, effectively becoming like an Einstein who has lived 10,000 extremely rich and diverse lives.Until we reach that point, AI will continue to become superhuman in certain aspects while remaining subpar in others. I predict that jobs requiring high memorization skills, including physical labour, will be the first to be automated. In contrast, roles that demand complex cognitive abilities will persist longer. The duration for which high-end white-collar jobs will dominate depends on future developments, which we can better understand through the forthcoming graph.",

While AI certainly offers incredible benefits, such as speeding up the screening process, it got me thinking: Are we overlooking something critical?The video highlighted how many qualified candidates are getting automatically rejected by AI-powered systems due to overly rigid screening functions. These systems might not fully capture a candidate's potential, missing out on those who could be a perfect fit for the role but dont quite meet the keyword-heavy criteria set by the algorithm.This is where recruiters continue to be absolutely fundamental to the process. While AI can help us sort through massive pools of applicants, its the human touch that ensures no good candidate falls through the cracks. We bring context, understanding, and a level of empathy that technology just cant replace.At the end of the day, AI is a tool, but its the recruiters expertise and intuition that really connects the dots and builds the most successful teams.",

I think in the short run businesses will run wild laying off people and leveraging AI. However, even Henry Ford realized that if workers don't have money they can't buy your product. The smart businesses will figure that out - hopefully fairly quickly - but the chowderheads will keep going. That could trigger a race to the bottom.So what do we do about it? Hell if I know, but we'd better start figuring it out. We need to find a way to engage the full spectrum of people without it degenerating into politics and conspiracies.

There will not be entirely new industries emerging as a result of advancements. We have spent the past century exploring limits of science to augment the human experience and have a good understanding of what is and isn't possible. Unless AI discovers new sciences, it will not be able to create anything humans were previously incapable of. AI will be able to assist in genetic engineering, robotic automation, and manufacturing synthetic materials, but those are existing industries. There are a finite number of needs and wants people possess.

But of course the world only needs so many baristas.Ideally we would offer free or subsidised education and they would retrain to join other professions, but obviously this depends on the will and prior education of the person and assumes the existence of sufficient jobs in other fields for most of the displaced people.In reality, I don't think it will work out so nicely - but we are talking perhaps 50 years for these changes to really penetrate the workplace, I mean many workplaces still haven't adapted to computers let alone the possibilities of machine learning and robotics.I switched from a PhD in Physics to one in Computational Neuroscience (largely focusing on machine learning) because I want to be a part of the next big revolution. But of course I imagine many in the [AI Winter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) felt the same.",

Advances in AI will mean that our intellectual strength is no longer required. Perhaps the only thing that will remain of our usefulness is human compassion?For this reason I see carers and teachers being something that people still want done by other humans. Or perhaps we should be thinking about jobs that arent currently values by the economic system, such as caring for children and looking after elderly family etc. That said I feel like we need to rediscover this side of us, as I believe the prevailing culture has left us disconnected from one another.If we can work out how to redistribute the benefits that technology provide (yes I believe that UBI is the only solution to this..), then I see little reason why most people would need to go to work at all. It has the potential to free us up for a much more meaningful life and we should be celebrating our imminent redundancy not fearing it!We will need to adjust though, as many people derive a sense of purpose from their work and will take some time to find a new sense of purpose without itThat said, why has our increased productivity up until now not resulted in the level of freedom it promised? I suspect its, in part, because if you can keep people in the rat race then they are much easier to control by those with power? The most advanced intelligence will still likely be held by those with money and power, but hopefully the level of technology available to the average person will allow them independence from the systems that give that power away in the first place.",

I was both excited and appalled that these hard-working employees were going to effectively be demoted just for using computers for part of their job. It's all just further proof that computers don't free up more time for the worker, they just make it so corporations can pay less for the same amount of work. Feel free to give your thoughts, I can't say which organization I work for, but figured this sub would like to hear of it.",

        "text": "Hey. Thanks for those links. Extremely interestingMy point is to look on disruption in terms of timing and psychological factors. Timing. It will take time. Question is how much time it will take. So will restaurants be disrupted in 50 years - sure. Will restaurants be disrupted in this decade - Im not that optimistic. Some repetitive stuff - probably. But not all. Second factor is psychological or lets call it human factor. I really like example of chess. We have right now boom in chess popularity even though computers are better in chess for almost a decade. Chess bots are much better. Their strategies are awesome and very unique, sometimes absolutely illogical for human. Still we mostly enjoy human competition, as machines and their played are soulless. Chess bots have transformed into the tool that most chess players use and we become better players thanks to them. I believe same will happen with many spheres nearest decade. Many repetitive non physical job will be disrupted. Question is -> will AI lead to substantial economical growth. If yes (taking into account declining population) everything will be alright with job market. Each company will require much less accountants but overall job market will grow.If we are lucky maybe it will lead to lower amount of work we need to do (look at what happens in Europe with 4 day week) so we will have more time as society for leisure, art and science.Moreover we can speculate that another trend will occur. As margins on different products will go up due to decreased costs the amount of investment capital will increase which might lead to new boom of investment. If we put those newly available money into science - well everything will be alright.Of course all of these do not take into account creation of scalable AGI. This will be critical technological breakthrough and it is very difficult to speculate on future.",

Literally had my parents tell me I need to see a therapist when I was 25yo because I was talking nonsense. Crazy to see that only 7 years later since that therapist (who actually agreed with me but said they didnt understand the field well enough to have an intellectual debate about it) we are now in a world where everyone is aware of it and having the oh shit moments I was having 10 years ago. Were definitely at a no turning back point now. Best we can do is embrace the tech and try to push it to develop in a direction we want it to go. It could end us all but we have to hope it lets us all live without the need for jobs as it has the potential to automate nearly all of our jobs within our lifetime (but probably 10 years or so). Many will say its impossible or at least in 10 years but they dont see the exponential increase in technology AI is as has been creating. ChatGPT alone is creating superhuman AI human hybrids. As messed up as it is its already reduced my workload by half since it came out and we wound up not hiring a copywriter because honestly, the chATGPT outputs are better written even if they take some thoughtful prompting and editing. Im not a coder besides HTML and CSS and even with just super basic understanding of JavaScript Im able to make amazing animated sections and complicated functionality for websites and even fricking basic video games with it. The $20/mo for chatgpt-4 is worth it to be ahead of the game. GPT-5 or 6 or similar AI could very likely surpass human level general intelligence and has the tech community fucking terrified as once it can self improve it will within likely days be intelligent beyond our understanding and easily take control if it wants* to.I like to stay optimistic and excited for the future. Honestly its the opposite of 10 years ago as I was very pessimistic then. We have the opportunity to live in an absolutely amazing world before we die. We can likely prevent aging and natural death since its not technically impossible and AI could and has already rapidly evolved the medical field (I design and market for a medical app company). We will also for better or worse likely upload our brains at some point and join the AI in some crazy hive mind existence. Brain to machine interfacing (implants) exist, are kind of functional already, and are likely to see rapid improvements and usage in about 5 years. Shits about to get crazy, hang on for the ride. If anything try to do something meaningful with your life, far too many people are too focused on just making money and taking advantage of others to get there.",

The ripples that sent in quality workers managements quotas even how my day to day job functioned through three different jobs I burnt through the following years was jaw dropping, even as I saw it coming. My point I was making is that the blue collar industry is like the ocean currents. For years it can be steady only to start hurling out violently. But the thing is the sheer amount of contacts, side jobs, and number of companies that all work slightly different from the next is so resourceful that we all learn to go with the flow and ditch sinking ships before you drowned. No company loyalty, not even ideal type of trade, just find something you can do or learn to do and make money off of it before it gets bad.If AI stats ramping up so quickly as I mentioned, wed all have time to figure out where to go next and adapt. Not saying things are ganna get better, hell it could get a lot worse and Ive seen plenty people wash out early in even the easiest of times. But me, and many others like me that I work with all see the singularity coming. Were prepping but the white collar and the rest who dont even know how the field works are essentially just saying were old news . They can feel that way, but Im pretty confident well make it through up until the robots just turn on us.Largely my opinion but it comes from working 6 straight years in construction.",

Computers didnt replace artists, bricklayers, doctors, mental health workers, and every other possible job. AI will. Anyone comparing AI to anything previous is, at best, willfully ignorant. Once AGI hits, itll be able to do every single thing humans can do, do it millions of times faster, do it far cheaper, and do it far longer.There will be nothing of substance left for humans to do, and any careers that somehow escape automation will be so inundated with frantic people that itll turn into a cutthroat race to the bottom.We should all enjoy the last few years of real life we have.

Honestly don't think it's there yet for graphic design but not far. Once can say I need this product with this background in this brand style at these dimensions and it works well then bye bye designers.Translators and large translation companies will be another one soon too be gone. Long term developers will be made redundant too as the AI can code quick and alot neater and keep inline with search engine metrics. So yeah most office jobs will be affected. Iike i could easily see AI being better and quicker at accountant tasks. Purchasing forecasting is would be better and maybe just needs to automate purchase orders to suppliersCustomer service i think it can help but I think people like to hear people when annoyed.",

The AI Revolution - It's not about replacing humans- It's about augmenting capabilities- Your teams are scared (and that's normal)2.

The People Factor - Blue collar is the new cool- Experience matters more than degrees- Age diversity = competitive advantageWhat does this mean for you? Stop waiting for the perfect moment Start building your AI strategy NOW Focus on upskilling your teams Create an anti-fragile workforceThe truth? Most organizations are sleeping on these changes.They think they have time.They don't.Your action plan: Audit your tech stack Map your skill gaps Train your people Build resilience2025 isn't coming - it's already here.And the question isn't IF you'll adapt.It's HOW FAST.Are you ready to lead this change?Or will you be another case study of \"too little, too late\"?The choice is yours.Let's go!",

At the same time, companies hesitate to hire entry-level talent, expecting productivity from day one. But if AI is handling junior-level work, does that mean fewer entry-level opportunities altogether?Historically, tech shifts eliminated some jobs while creating new ones. But AI isnt just changing how we workits impacting who gets hired. If breaking into the industry becomes harder, what happens to the long-term talent pipeline?Could I offer a solution if you have read this far?Businesses should provide more internships that lead to full-time positions. Both parties benefit: employers have a low-risk method of training and assessing talent prior to hiring, and job seekers obtain practical experience. If AI is reshaping junior roles, hiring practices should evolve too.Having developed full-stack applications with React, Ruby on Rails, AWS, and Azure, I have direct experience with how technological changes necessitate flexibility. I can't wait to learn, grow, and contribute in a setting where I can use my abilities and keep improving. I'm prepared to contribute, whether it be in a junior position or through an internship leading to a full-time position.

The main effect was that AI research which had been stuck for some time was able to advance.Lately, we are seeing generative AI which can be used for text generation, image generation, something like reasoning, and critically text and image/video/audio understanding.A lot of the current hype stuff relevant to office workers is around text and ideas expressed in text. There has been a lot of progress and it is possible lots of office jobs will be changed or displaced.However, the same technologies do enable a robot to understand the scene it is seeing, make predictions about what will happen next, and 'think' about what to do in a more sophisticated way. This enables robots to function in a less controlled environment with less supervision than has been the case.There have also been advances in robotics. Drones have improved a lot, and you can see the kind of robots that Boston Dynamics can make on youtube.Fire fighting is a high risk activity, requiring navigating in very difficult environments, making life or death judgement. You need to work fast.I think you could see increased use of robots where it reduces risk, in the same way the bomb squad currently use robots. Maybe you could start an operation in a large building by releasing a drone swarm that would provide you with a map of the building and locate any very obvious humans. Maybe you will carry a small robot which you release to do particularly high risk things. If we do really well, maybe a walking robot will carry heavy things for you.But I don't think robots are going to replace firefighters in your career. Even after a decade of advance, they will not be trusted to make life and death decisions, and will not have advanced enough to navigate difficult terrain like a house full of trash quickly enough. Hardware advances a lot slower than software.",

I've never met people in positions that were so displaceable where they were so oblivious and ignorant to what's happening while beingvso close to the culprit.This is quite the bold statement. Two things to consider:First, if you worked as a SWE, you should know that the current tools simply are not able to replace humans yet, not even close. They would need at least a couple of major leaps in capability to do so. Anything beyond trivial, isolated problems needs to be reviewed and fixed (if it can do them at all). Thus, requiring as much knowledge (and often as much time) to finish the work.So the question then becomes \"how long will it take to improve enough?\", which leads to the second point. If you now work in AI, I hope you're aware of the history. Breakthroughs and plateaus have been the story of the field for decades. No one knows when the new breakthroughs will come, maybe \"*this time will be different!\"*, but the historical pattern is that it will take some time for the next major innovation to get around the seemingly-inherent limitations in LLMs.People really underestimated the challenge of transferring to real-world uses. We had robots driving around obstacles and pouring beers *decades* ago. Why have robotics barely broken out of being used only in highly-engineered environments? Real world complications and context is far harder to deal with than people give credit. To actually replace SWEs, AI will have to deal with that.Eventually it will get there, but the idea it is right around the corner is cope.",

The framework dev will and can be automated or maybe have reduced work force. And eventually the AI will become a code buddy for people who are really smart but will definitely replace or I would rather say shuffle the people in software industry. Now new things always comes with new branches so we may see things like AI agent management, control, data annotations etc as new jobs/ positions. And sometimes I think if we let AI take over our decisions making via NeuraLink chips then what would human minds do? Sometimes I think the decision making process for comparing things, get info etc would be a lot easy but then what would humans do with saved time and brain?",

Depending on your level of involvement and pre-existing biases, there may not be any \"evidence\" that will sway you from one camp to another. At the end of the day, this is all forecasting. And humans are notoriously terrible at forecasting.However, I can certainly share some of my research that bolsters the camp 3 view. OpenAI's research claims that 19% of jobs in the US have at least a 50% exposure to automation: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf)Accenture argues that 40% of ALL tasks across ALL industries are at high risk for complete automation ([https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document/Accenture-A-New-Era-of-Generative-AI-for-Everyone.pdf#zoom=40](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document/Accenture-A-New-Era-of-Generative-AI-for-Everyone.pdf#zoom=40)). McKinsey claims that *today's* gen AI can, in practice. automate tasks that account for about 60 - 70% labor hours. They also estimate that 50% of current work will be automated as early as 2030 ([https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights)). They also argue that the productivity gains (and labor cost reduction impacts) of gen AI will amount to $2.4T+ annually. Lastly, although the WEF doesn't produce any of its own research on the topic -- they have published several articles on job displacement and generative AI, claiming that we are on the brink of the fourth industrial revolution.If you view the conservative estimates from any of these organizations as remotely possible, then it's difficult to see how camp 3 is incorrect.I'd also add that, if you're building any B2B gen AI solutions right now, or are even tangentially involved in the space -- you'd have a very hard time disagreeing with camp 3. Give it 3 - 6 months for some of these tools to start coming out -- and you might start to see the writing on the wall.",

Then for this to have been asked so openly, so boldly?People need to start thinking less about money and power, and more about what kind of world we want to build together. Think about the passion, dedication, and commitment it takes for one person to become that skilled. Do we want to take away these life experiences from people, so we can concentrate more wealth and more power in the hands of fewer people who control these AI technologies?

The freeing of labor and increased productivity allowed us to invest in more R&D and develop more advanced agricultural science to further increase yields.Maybe some day AI will truly do absolutely everything imaginable, but were most likely quite some time away from that day, and in any case at that point nothing will matter, so in the interim the best thing to do may be to indeed study CS, and study more to stay as far ahead of the curve as possible and to learn how to leverage AI to its best utility, and accomplish more than ever.",

It helps with boilerplate code, debugging, and documentation, but developers still need to:* Understand system architecture* Make critical design decisions* Ensure security and scalability* Translate business requirements into technical solutions* Review and validate AI-generated codeThe most successful developers I know are already using AI to handle repetitive tasks while focusing on higher-level problem solving. This actually makes them more valuable, not less.The key is to embrace AI as a tool that enhances your capabilities rather than viewing it as a threat. I'd say now is actually a great time to become a developer - you'll grow alongside these tools and have an edge over those who resist adapting.",

This isn't new - technology has altered work for centuries. The aim is usually not to eliminate jobs completely, but to improve efficiency, safety, and productivity.The idea of AI replacing jobs can cause worry about unemployment and outdated skills. While some jobs might decline, new ones often appear, like managing or collaborating with AI. This may need a shift in learning and training. AI can take over dangerous tasks and leave humans more time for creative, strategic, and social activities.This change goes beyond jobs; it affects how we see work, education, and adaptability in a rapidly changing world. Societies may need to change education and continuous learning to adjust to working with AI. There are ethical issues too, such as making sure AI benefits everyone and serves the public good.In my view, AI has great potential to solve complex issues, from healthcare to the environment. But it's important to carefully consider its ethical effects, social equity, and human impact as it's developed and used. The aim should be to enhance human abilities and improve life quality, not just replace jobs.",

Do you think AI can do the work of its 700 customer service workers?Based on what I have seen, its feasible. However, would you trust AI to manage financial transactions and decide who to extend credit to? As AI breezes past our benchmarks, is it ready to take on more roles?Gemini can ace the Bar Exam but isnt a competent lawyer. ChatGPT can solve LeetCode challenges and pass software engineer interviews but isnt capable of coding solutions independently.GenAI is showing how weak our assessment tools are. They advance the most primitive types of intelligence to the front of the line without evaluating more complex, higher-value capabilities.Theres a cottage industry that prepares candidates to interview for tech jobs and pass tests because the capabilities required to do the job successfully differ from those required to get hired.Researchers have been identifying gaps for decades, but were only now building more accurate assessments in response to AIs progress. Business leaders and academia should take note.CEOs who look at AI through the lens of narrow benchmarks and demos will replace people with platforms that arent up to the job.Companies that hire based on weak assessment tools will be staffed by replaceable workers, not the future capabilities they need to remain competitive.Universities that admit based on standardized test scores and teach students to pass surface-level capabilities assessments prepare students for jobs that will not exist when they graduate.Businesses and academia must get in front of this trend. Most courses are obsolete. Curricula must be realigned with the future of work, not the easily automated skills of the past.The number of obsolete jobs is growing. Hiring must look past the AI replacement cycle to bring in the resilient capabilities the business needs to survive.If we dont adapt, well have a generation of businesses and workers who cant compete in the AI marketplace.",

Whatever you were going to specialize in should have been built on that foundation, and even if that ultimate goal of being a doctor or engineer is no longer relevant, those skills should still be of use. >when we do enter the workforce, unprepared as we will be, we will have to compete with people with 10-20+ years of experience using AI.Experience is probably going to be far less of a factor than you imagine. Afterall, just having access to YouTube I've re-learned things I was doing inefficiently for years ... decades! When you have the collected experience of humanity at your fingertips, it takes less time to come up to speed. > Don't think that you will work in an industry that won't be affected by thisAgreed, we'll all be affected. But, older people will probably just retire earlier and earlier as their skills become outdated, and they simply don't have the will to adapt. I'll bet one of the first things the government does to deal with the unemployment is to lower the retirement age. > I dont know how long I can keep watching my hopes and dreams being smashed apart by developments beyond my control.Take a deep breath. I hear you. But, let me give you a different perspective on all this. 25% of Americans are already on Social Security. If your IQ is too low, or you have a learning disability, or you're too old, etc, etc ... we simply don't expect you to find employment. We can simply ... adjust those numbers. We do it all the time. Maybe someone with an IQ below 70 doesn't need to work now, but that could be bumped to 100. Maybe someone over 65 isn't expected to work now, but that could be nudged down to 50 ... to make room for your generation. Before we all retire from working in the decades to come, there will be a middle ground of needing humans, but not nearly enough to employ everyone. That's okay, because before the sexual revolution, half of people didn't work anyway. So, we'll simply have to allow people raising kids, or doing other 'work' to be compensated. Probably, again, by social security. Then once all the mothers, fathers, old people, and mentally ill people are out of the mix, you'll have room. I imagine working will slowly become less of a lifelong pursuit, and more of a 'tour of duty'. Those who do well in school will opt for higher education, and then sign on for 4 years of specialized labor, after which they'll be compensated and probably have their social security enhanced. At that point, they can choose to 'retire', just like you do from the military, continue for another 4 years, or retrain. We have all these tools already. Where will we get the money for all that social security? Well, we can change tax law overnight, but also once we have ASI, there's really no point in paying Raytheon a hundred trillion dollars a year, now is there? Americans can literally just siphon money from defense waste into existing social programs. We won't even lose anything, as a standing army and research can all be handled more efficiently by AI anyway. We won't need soldiers any more than we need factory workers. We can adjust these things, as needed, to keep people competing in the economy, while admitting that most people simply can't complete at the highest levels. Those who can will be compensated, and just like we do right now, those who can't will be taken care of ... probably much better than they are right now, as they will make up the vast majority of the voting public, and no matter how cynical you are, governments and corporations will value keeping the vast majority of the public relatively happy, knowing that a bunch of people with nothing else to do are usually exactly what topples governments.",

While AI and automation are certainly going to change many industries, the idea that they're going to kill all jobs is just way too simplistic.First, AI tends to excel in tasks of a repetitive and data-driven nature. As much as this is going to displace certain jobs, it also opens up opportunities for new roles that tend to leverage human creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligencevery hard attributes to replicate in AI. For example, the new fields emerging are those related to AI oversight, ethical governance, and human-AI collaboration.Second, not everyone either desires or needs a college degree for employment with meaning. Practical skills, especially those involving physical tasks like plumbing and auto mechanics, are far less likely to be automated anytime soon. These jobs call for problem-solving that's complex and expertise of a hands-on naturethe kind of stuff AI still has a very hard time doing.The timeline for sweeping job displacement by AI is also unknown. Some believe this change could take place in 2035 or 2040. Others find this shift will be gradual and slow. The speed at which this happens is entirely dependent on technological advancement, economic policies, and societal adaptation.Attention needs to be focused on resilient community building, adjusting to new realities. Research into sustainable living patterns and local economies shall help in cushioning uncertainty with AI-driven changes. Preparing to coexist with AI will ensure that benefits from technological development are well-spread.Though difficult, it's not all bad. If we stay informed and are able to adjust ourselves, that should be enough to steer ourselves through these transitions and find new opportunities in the emerging job market.",

        "text": "**Understanding the Current Situation**A lot of people are worried about chat GPT, Bard, Llama, and all the other large language models taking their jobs. But they haven't really considered the underlying issues that have led to today's situation. Here i'm going to walk through those issues and problems and use that to project what the future of the industry might look like, regardless of automation and large language models. **The Effects of Company Cuts and Migration to IT**Last year, we saw significant cuts from large companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, leading to a loss of employees. The finance sector experienced hiring freezes, yet we witnessed one of the largest migrations of talent into the IT industry.On top of that the UK IT industry has been growing 10% year on year, and the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/reskilling-revolution-jobs-future-skills/) states that the world needs to reskill a billion people into IT to maintain our current pace.I enjoy mentoring in tech and usually have at least 3 or 4 people im working with at any one time, and half of them are coming over to IT from their existing job. Re-skilling and investing their time in coding, architecture and infrastructure automation.## Questions to ConsiderWith these changes, ask yourself:1. What happens when a large volume of people from different industries moves into one industry, all with the same skill set?2. How will the supply and demand challenges we have today project forward as the currently undersupplied area fills up with people?3. How are business and thought leaders responding to these changes today, and how will they respond in the future?## The Misconception of Supply and the Future of TalentMost people think that the issue is a lack of talent, and while it's true that large companies struggle to find the right talent, we're not considering what happens tomorrow. The markets are already responding to minimize the impacts of the talent shortage.Automation with chat GPT, Bard, and others will happen, but even without it, there are business mechanisms that replace multiple people with one.This contrasts starkly with the outsourcing practices of 25 years ago when one person would be replaced by 15.Market forces drive the strategies of today, which in turn impact the landscape of tomorrow.## The Potential Future ModelIn the future, we might see a team of one or two super senior people overseeing automation and business processes, similar to how a single employee supervises several self-checkout machines at a grocery store. This model could become more prevalent in the future.But again, even if it isnt automated this way, it would be reduced in some other way, it would be risky to assume there will always be an abundance of say web developer roles.## Opportunities in the Changing LandscapeAs things move forward, regardless of automation or business processes, they will simplify the systems in place, but things wont just stop. We wont pat each other on the back and say, job done. Scope and requirements never end, they just expand to cover new domains, the challenge will be spotting what those domains might look like.For AI alone, here is a starter for 10:1. AI Ethics and Compliance Officer: Ensuring AI systems adhere to ethical guidelines and comply with legal regulations.2. AI Model Auditor: Reviewing and auditing AI models to ensure their accuracy, fairness, and reliability.3. AI Data Curator: Organizing, labeling, and maintaining large datasets used for training AI models.4. AI Trainer: Teaching AI systems to perform specific tasks, including fine-tuning and improving their understanding of human language.5. Human-AI Interaction Designer: Designing and optimizing interfaces between humans and AI systems to ensure seamless and efficient communication.6. AI Explainability Specialist: Helping users understand how AI systems make decisions and predictions by providing clear explanations and visualizations.7. AI Security Specialist: Protecting AI systems from malicious attacks and ensuring the privacy of user data.8. AI Integration Consultant: Assisting businesses in integrating AI solutions into their existing workflows and processes.9. AI Policy Advisor: Guiding governments and organizations in developing policies and regulations related to AI usage and implementation.10. AI-powered Application Developer: Building and maintaining applications that leverage AI technologies to enhance user experiences and solve complex problems.My advice is get ahead of the curve, look at the problems of tomorrow and expand your mind to think outside the box in terms of what potential new areas of work could open up.If you think this is worth discussing further let me know in the comments and I can make a post on more speculative jobs and what they might look like.

And within a YEAR? Almost everything could be AI-generated.Let that sink in for a second This isnt just about writing simple scripts. Were talking full-on coding, automated by AI. Fast, efficient, relentless.But heres the kicker, if AI starts generating ALL the code, where does that leave human developers? Do we shift from writing to reviewing? From creating to overseeing?Amodei says the biggest challenge wont just be tech, itll be the impact on jobs, industries, and how we define work in the coding world.My take? The game is changing FAST. And those who learn how to work with AI instead of against it will win. What do you think? Is this exciting or terrifying? And how will it change YOUR work? Drop your thoughts in the comments!",

Every executive is talking about replacing the majority of those jobs lost with AI and I believe it. The company I work for is forcefully pushing AI into every nook and cranny. For 1/3 I would say within 5 years. With current AI technologies we're going to see massive loss of jobs for anyone working in any digital field. Information tech, Art, assistants, journalist, media, medicine, call centers, and so many more. Most of these jobs can already be done by AI to a large extent. I can see it getting significantly better in about 2 years. The reason we aren't seeing anything major yet is because corps are slow to implement these changes. But 2 years is enough time for major disruption and adoption.1/2 is likely to follow a few years after 1/3 when the next version of AI is released.",

They got some time off waiting for stuff to grow, didn't have to work 16-18 hours a day most of the time, they had marginally more enjoyable work than a human cog in a factory, and they got to live in a generally healthier environment (less polution/disease). Children worked in factories too, and people got laid off and starved when there was a surplus of labor. Having more stuff doesn't make you wealthier if your life becomes shittier in the process.While it might be true that not everything can be done by a machine, I can't think of any low skill jobs that would be IMPOSSIBLE to replace with machines. Self driving vehicles ready for market will be a reality within the next 15 years, self checkout lines at grocery stores are becoming more and more prevalent, and the ability of computers to process human language is steadily advancing. If we do not eventually replace these jobs with machines, it will be because we as a society choose not to.",

I'm not worried about AI replacing me until it can fix broken machines and equipment, mend fence and figure out what species of tree will be popular in 5 years.As for the rest of you be excited. AI can do a lot of neat things but it still needs people to direct it and imagine new things. So far its a tool and we are using it in exciting new ways! This is our steam engine, our airplane!

Nurses will provide a human interface for routine health concerns that require in-person assessment - probably most things. GPs and primary care nurse practitioners will be available to manage some of the complexity previously seen by specialists - lots of very powerful devices coming down the line that will eventually make this possible. Itll get quite rare to actually need to refer out, which will save a lot of time and money. Specialists will absolutely still be needed, as at some point there will need to be human input as to what the algorithms spit out. But such specialists will likely be far fewer in number and have more of a quantitative/academic background relative to today.It probably wont happen at once but instead a march toward that over some number of years. Eventually AI will probably just take over every job but thatll be some time yet.",

Children are going to be AI natives, much like those who are in their 20s now are social media/phone natives, and they won't need anyone to teach them how to use AI to make whatever the hell they want. Like, we don't teach children how to type anymore, and we won't be teaching children how to creatively use AI, they'll think of all kinds of ways. So the artists will retain their edge, for the very short term. Kinda like \"Prompt engineers\" as a job field, it's really only temporary until everyone becomes comfortable using the tech. 3. Sure, and where will that demand be in the future, when again, as stated, *everyone* is going to be competent at using AI? It'll be sewered unless you've got a really, really, specific idea that you're having trouble creating yourself.

That's why we need UBI to give people a baseline from which to work from, it'll still be possible to build wealth and social status, just the concept of a 9-5 job will probably disappear.If we achieve AGI it gets even easier, just ask the AGI to build wealth for you. Also I don't buy into this thing of everyone moving into the trades etc, just won't happen, if anything AI will probably make blue collar jobs even harder to fill as it lowers the barrier to entry for many white collar professions.It's easier to think of it as having access to the world's most productive employee, it works both ways, existing companies can reduce staff but it'll be easier for 1 or 2 people start ups to get going as well.",

        "text": "&#x200B;One industry that has slowly being replaced with AI is customer service. Most current chatbots don't use a llm or at least a very primitive one, but a locally integrated GPT or llama engine that gets regular updates with a local business knowledge base would save a ton of money. There are about 3 million customer service jobs in the united states alone, which presents an opportunity of currently about 135 billion dollars a year in potential savings. This is just employee salary alone, but there are a whole breadth of expenses estimated around 200 billion total if you include taxes, health premiums etc that will be saved. One company alone, Charter communications, has about 100000 employees, and at about 45k a year salary on average, we're looking at about a savings of 1 billion alone estimating 20000 customer service employees. Fine tuning a LLM to work specifically for the company shouldn't cost more than 10 million a year plus the cost of GPUs if they are hosting it locally or the rental cost from a cloud service keeping everything up to date and functioning properly. Eventually you will have the LLM connect to a voice model that is indistinguishable from a real live person, even able to have small talk and conversations with the caller if the caller chooses to engage. This saves charter about a billion dollars a year in savings, and they will have a much more capable employee than a lot of current ones that work there. I ran some numbers through chatgpt and at about 3 cents per interaction (estimated by the software) would be about 17 million a year in costs although I found that current cost per 1000 tokens on chatgpt is one fifth of one penny, so reduce those costs by 1/15th and you're at about 2 million a year to essentially replace a 1 billion dollar cost to your company.The great thing is even though it eliminates jobs, customer service can be very taxing with difficult customers (did it for 5 years), and AI can handle that with ease. Some company very soon is going to have a multiple dialect text to speech model that will simulate voice very well, until then this can replace all chat agents globally as well. This would all likely be powered by Nvidia chips. I could see most companies go with a cloud solution at first and slowly integrate it into their service as they see the cost savings, and eventually if they see the cost savings model go with a locally hosted version and pay for as many racks of B100 or B200 chips as it would take to meet demand. Most large corporations will probably shift fully over from human agents to AI based over the next 5 years. They could even use their best customer service agents as training data (if they even need to train, there will probably be models for customer service agents available that get licensed out).&#x200B;Programs like CHAT with RTX already show how simple it is for a single person to get input based on data of pdf and text files. inputting a location on your computer you can already run your own local version of customer service employee (at least for knowledge questions). The biggest hurdle is getting it to interface with the current software and get it to perform actions on accounts.",

In the context of current business structures, people absolutely do economically valuable work. This is very easily measured via economic returns on investment and comparison between similar businesses. That has nothing to do with what AI might be able to do in replacement. But to suggest that knowledge workers arent making decisions that contribute to real economic value shows a complete lack of understanding regarding the subject.",

In my latest article, I explore how Large Language Models are reshaping our labor landscape in 2025.From productivity gains to potential job displacement, the AI revolution presents India with unprecedented challenges and opportunities. While LLMs can automate routine tasks and serve as powerful skill multipliers, they also raise concerns about employment disruptionespecially in a country adding millions to its workforce annually.Are we witnessing another tech bubble, or the dawn of a new economic era? Discover why the most successful approach may be viewing AI as a tool that extends human capabilities rather than replaces them.Join the conversation on how India can navigate this technological transformation while ensuring its benefits are broadly shared across our diverse economy.",

Some individual jobs will be replaced, but roles won't, IMHO. Rather, the roles will shift upward in complexity and productivity requirements as AI tools become more common in each field.Generative AI is great at cranking out bulk work, but it's terrible at planning, goal-setting, and socially complex interactions. Those will continue to be the domain of us humans for at least a decade or more, and I'm guessing much more.Once AI can actually do my job (only about 20% of which is actually automatable) then maybe I'll have to find a new way to be of value to the world, and that's kind of a cool prospect, IMHO.> then I struggle to see how anyone could feel safe / excited?Those are two very different things. I don't think it's necessary to feel that my job is \"safe\" in order to be excited about living in the middle of one of the most important technological breakthroughs since the invention of the printing press and maybe industrial production.",

        "text": "AI Wont Save the EconomyUnless We Make It Work for EveryoneTheres a lot of hype around AI driving productivity and economic growth. But what if were getting it wrong?Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu just dropped a game-changing paper on AIs real economic impact. His research makes it clear: AI wont automatically create prosperityit depends on how we use it.Here are five stats that should make every leader pay attention: 50% of productivity gains from AI could end up concentrated in just a handful of companies. Only 0.4% of businesses in the US have adopted AI in a meaningful wayso the gap is growing. Wages could drop by up to 10% in industries that replace workers with AI, rather than augment them. Less than 10% of AI R&D is focused on human augmentationmost is geared towards automation. Inequality could spike if AI adoption follows the same pattern as past tech revolutions.The takeaway? AIs economic impact isnt written in stoneits shaped by decisions we make today.If we treat AI as a workforce multiplier instead of a cost-cutting machine, well see stronger businesses, better wages, and a more resilient economy.So how do we steer AI in the right direction? Governments, business leaders, and AI developers need to collaborate on policies, incentives, and strategies that drive broad-based valuenot just efficiency gains.Would love to hear your takehow is AI changing your industry?

AI is already all over the place and mostly invisible to people, they don't care, or they are oblivious (google search, weather, news writing, youtube/tiktok narration, movie recommendations, etc. etc. etc.). While it's undeniable that there is a several-orders-of-magnitude metric shit ton more to AI than this surface layer stuff people are touching every day already, I think it will be more like previous tech: EVERYBODY has a smart phone now and most users don't know everything they can do with it. Even tech savvy people don't make the most of their smart devices as it is. Most people just use the minimum basic features (which already have AI behind them) and are happy enough.It will just be a whole lot more of that... \"Oh cool. My nephew showed me a new app/service. NiftyNewApp has a neat new feature that makes my life easier. It says 'AI' but whatever. Everything's AI these days. Don't really care. Anyway, it's cool. I can just do the thing. Take my $2.\" ...or.. \"My laptop has this new thing that sorts all my files and cleans up my folders and stuff. I love it. No idea how it works, but now it's like magic.. my files are just organized based around how I use my laptop. Cool!\" ...or.. \"Neat! My map app now has this trip planning feature that just books my whole trip for me. I just say how much I'm willing to spend for my vacation and it sets everything up with like the best hotels and stuff. Amazing. I don't know how they make money, but I don't care. It's awesome.\"Right? Just a whole lot MORE of what we already have going. People will just get used to the idea that new shit is constantly coming on board. As for careers and people's lives, yeah - this is the first time white collar people have had a kind of existential threat to their careers. Mid-level peeps at companies who write things and manage projects, etc .. there's a threat there. Maybe I'm off base but I think -- as we have done through every previous major \"disruption\" -- we'll work with what is and it will just be very different from before but people figure out what to do. New and different careers will exist. Old careers won't.Disclaimer: I'm super tired from a long workday here, though, so I'm probably missing some huge fundamental that I'm sure I'll see in the comments. LOL",

I see that currently in same vein as my hypothetical recruitment agency will have workers that will take over all jobs on the planet, and we will use zero AI. And every job you name specifically is met with were taking that job too with zero exceptions. Or I as CEO of the first recruiting agency also take on a second agency that has placed workers already in 10,000 jobs, so I can then say, its already begun, weve taken over 10,000 jobs, and let that be evidence that we will soon take every job on the planet. Also AI will replace every chess player in competitive tournaments as it is already the best chess player around, therefore humans can stop playing chess (competitively). Also AI will replace all spouses and romantic partners for all humans. And at some point humans wont even be needed for such relationships as AI will have it perfectly covered, but first AI will replace all partners, being far superior to your current partner in every way conceivable. Im pro AI, and it being positioned as every job will be augmented with AI is something Id plausibly go along with, and even that strikes me as hype if saying it will happen in say next 50 years. Replace strikes me as so outlandish it either needs case made better how that happens, and/or lets wager (please) on your take, as Im thoroughly convinced it is implausible.",

I personally have my doubts on the scaling abilities of modern AI, but the thing is, if we did scale its capabilities, then wed have a machine thats not only getting more intelligent, but also potentially more empathetic and more creative. Simply jumping ship from an intelligence profession to an empathy profession like a psychologist or therapist wont cut it in a future where AI is at the very least perceived to be more empathetic on account of its near infinite patience.Trades will probably be safe for the foreseeable future, but we only need so many plumbers and carpenters.But all that besides, most people would simply rather vote for a solution. The more serious of an impact AI has on the economy, the more the political pressure will grow until at some point lacking some kind of AI-skeptical stance becomes politically unviable. Even if your job is 10 years away from being automated, thatll influence you to vote.Predictions that elites will wield some kind of outsized influence on politics and society to prevent political action dont seem likely to me for the simple fact that I think political pressure will rise faster than the rate at which power concentrates.But they do have enough power to prevent you from voting for the weird third party guy though. Gotta be realistic here.",

Im three-quarters through my current career, but I havent been excelling or feeling fulfilled. Ive been thinking about venturing into something new, and after much consideration, Ive decided to dedicate myself to mastering AI and related fields. Yes, Im talking about the full 10,000-hour challenge. Its a bold goal, and Im ready for it.The PlanGoal: I aim to spend 10,000 hours learning everything AI-related, which breaks down to roughly 13.5 hours per day. This will include formal education through a masters degree, self-study, hands-on projects, and other relevant experiences.Time Commitment: I'll dive in full-time, meaning no distractions. Ill be cutting out dating and any significant social commitments for this period.Daily Schedule: Ill stick to a very structured routine that includes a set food schedule (same meals every week), planned study sessions, and consistent hours for both practical and theoretical work.Housing & Finances: Im fortunate enough to be able to sustain myself with my current housing payments, which means I can focus entirely on this without worrying too much about day-to-day financial survival. Yes, Ill lose a pension by stepping away from my current career, but Im confident I can make that up through the opportunities AI will provide.The Learning ProcessThe goal is not just to amass hours but to truly master everything AI-related. This will include:1. Formal Education: Ill pursue a Masters degree in a relevant AI or machine learning field, which will give me both structure and credibility.2. Self-Study: This will involve online courses, research papers, coding exercises, and exploring AIs applications in various industries.3. Hands-On Projects: I will build real-world projects to showcase my understanding of the field.4. Networking & Mentorship: Ill be reaching out to experts, attending conferences (virtually or in person), and staying plugged into the AI community to stay updated on trends and get feedback on my work.Endgame: High-Paying AI JobBy the time I complete this, Ill have built a high-level resume, showcasing the projects Ive completed and the deep knowledge Ive gained. My goal is to land a high-paying job in AI, machine learning, or a related field, applying everything Ive learned in an impactful way.Im documenting the whole journey, sharing updates on my progress, and possibly offering advice or resources to others who are considering a similar shift. Its going to be a challenging and intense period, but I believe this will pay off long-term.Anyone else considering a major career shift like this? Id love to hear your thoughts and any advice you might have for tackling such an ambitious goal.Thanks.",

        "text": "AI: Actually making things better, or just moving the same headaches around?Steven and I attended this months AI GTM Exchange, where a group of GTM leaders had an open (and refreshingly unscripted) chat about whats really happening with AI adoption. No fluffjust straight talk on whats working and whats not.Some big takeaways:1 The AI workforce gamble Some businesses are already making bold claims about AI replacing jobs, but is that a smart bet? AI isnt a magic fixit often just shifts the problems somewhere else.2 Hype vs. reality AI has massive potential, but integrating it into existing systems is proving harder than many expected. The tools are advancing fast, but so are the challenges they create.3 AIs price tag The cost of AI is still a major barrier. With some businesses struggling to justify the spend, could this push tech pricing towards outcome-based models rather than the usual subscriptions?4 Adoption is stalling AI is everywhere, but full-scale adoption? Not so much. One reason: no ones training teams on how to actually use it. Maybe its time for an AI Enablement Officer to help businesses get real value from AI instead of just experimenting with it.Big shoutout tofor hosting and to everyone who joined the discussion! Thanks again toandfor facilitating.What do you reckonare businesses truly getting ahead with AI, or just hoping for the best?",

Experience at a top firm.He had sent out dozens of applications.Almost zero responses.This job market is brutal, he said. Its like companies just stopped hiring.At first, I agreed.And then I read this Atlantic article calling the job market frozen.But heres the thingthis isnt a hiring freeze.This is a reset.Businesses arent holding back because theyre struggling.Theyre holding back to see what AI can do.For decades, companies scaled by adding people.Now? Theyre seeing if they can scale by replacing tasks.And Ive been predicting this:Headcount will shrinkbut the people who stay?Theyll be doing more.Theyll be better aligned.Theyll be mission-critical.Its no longer about filling seats. Its about alignment.Its not about whos available. Its about whos essential.The future isnt more people. Its the right people.\"Were not in a hiring freezewere in a reset.AI is forcing companies to rethink work, and human capital is shrinking.The ones who stay?Theyll be mission-critical.Im sharing the original Atlantic article in the commentsworth a read.",

        "text": "THE PROBLEM with AI is it will become the \"source\" of creativity...... and not just a \"tool\" for people to use.Like the internal combustion engine is the source of movement energy for lots of things - it completely replaced horses as \"the\" source of movement energy.Imagine how horses would be unemployed in their hundreds of millions today if we hadn't simply stopped breading them when the internal combustion engine re-invented what \"movement energy creation\" required.**The \"horse situation\" undermines the old economic argument \"There'll always be new jobs for people to do when innovation comes along and makes old jobs obsolete.\"**Not always.AI will do to human jobs what the internal combustion engine did to horses jobs.And if governments and brainy \"Thought leaders\" of the world don't see this coming - there'll be social collapse, riots, starvation, government bankruptcy, wars.Does ANYONE see any workable way around the pain? I've heard of universal benefits being tried.... $1600 per month for some people in a trial in the UK. That's like 5 billion a month or some other incredible amount for the whole \"working population\". I imagine the rich (who are supposed to supply the wealth via taxes) will nope out of the UK at such a punishing tax rate.Other's pointed out another issue with UB...... someone in the UK \"up north\" where the poor live - can live off 1000 a month with some difficulty. Someone \"down south\" in the wealth of London has the local living costs to contend with - 1000 rent is LOW. UB wont cover all the rent, and not even touch other bills....---------------A tangent thought on the emergence of ghettos via UB...... \"The blame game\" and how everyone still \"in society\" won't feel bad about them........A real danger with UB is it makes ghettos! All the super disadvantaged areas of a country will fill with those who's only income is UB.... because there's simply not enough jobs! They'll be living side by side with those that NEED major mental health treatments, drug addicts, thieves, etc... the whole group forgotten about by wealthy society.The unemployed general poor hiding (by numbers) all those people with drug/mental health issues - and the rich blaming all the rapes/murders/arson/violence/robbery/thievery on \"No good people who don't WANT to live in and take part in society!\"What a lovely excuse! Don't support those people with MAJOR life problems, use all that excess social issues it creates as a way of hating on ALL the ghetto people.I'm just trying to think through the dynamics of the situation of the singularity, and how nasty people will cover up their selfish ways by screwing over the defenceless as it's always been.It doesn't look good if we can't keep our head above water, and the box is filling fast.",

The gaming industry is facing a rough patch with layoffs shaking major studios. So, whats behind the storm?Lets dive into the real issues.Do We Need a Grassroots System?What if the industry shifted from maximizing profit to prioritizing creativity, fair pay, and employee well-being?A grassroots approach could provide a real solution: Support for indie devs Smaller studios and up-and-coming talent need a fair shot. Work-life balance Burnout is real, and employees need time to recharge. Worker representation Employees need a voice in company decisions and workload.Is AI to Blame for Gaming Layoffs?AI is improving workflows but also driving job cuts. Roles in QA, testing, and design are being replaced to save costs.AI isnt the only culprit, thoughit's being used to maximize profits at the expense of the people whove built these companies.Is There Too Much Profit at the Top?Gaming companies are making record profits, yet the gap between executives and employees is widening. The focus on monetization and cost-cutting is pushing layoffs while top execs cash in. Wheres the balance?The Bottom LineFor a healthier industry, we need a more balanced, grassroots system that values talent at every level.AI and profit-driven layoffs are real concerns, but the change starts with prioritizing people over short-term profit. What are your thoughts? Is AI the cause of layoffs, or is it the focus on profits at the top? Do we need a grassroots shift?",

        "text": "**Yin Wang: Automatic programming is impossible. Why do I not care about artificial intelligence?**Some people have heard that I want to start a business and have suggested some ideas to fudge the mass. They said that since you are a programming language expert and now artificial intelligence (AI) is very hot, you can actually create an \"automatic programming system\", claiming to automatically generate programs, replace the programmer's work, and save a lot of Labor expenditure, so that you can pull investments in the \"AI rush.\"Someone even gave me its name, \"DeepCoder ( = Deep Learning + Coder)\". The slogan is: \"With DeepCoder, there's no need for Top Coder!\" Others have pointed out the latest research being bombastically bragged about in this direction, such as Microsoft's Robust Fill...I would thank these people for their concern, but I don't care or feel optimistic about artificial intelligence. Now let me briefly talk about my opinions.***Machine-like heart***Many people like to advocate artificial intelligence, automatic cars, robots and other technologies, but if you look closely, you will find that not only these people do not understand what human intelligence is, or what the limitations of artificial intelligence are, but also the hearts of these \"AI men\" have been seriously mechanized. They have lost their humanity more or less as if they have forgotten that they are human, forgotten what human need most, and forgotten the value of the human. These people are like what Chaplin pointed out in the final speech of the \"Great Dictator\": \"A machine-like person, a machine-like heart.\"Whenever AI is mentioned, these people must be ambitiously claiming to replace human work and save labor costs. For the time being, we will not discuss whether these goals can be achieved, but they and my values are completely contradictory from the beginning. A great company should create real new value for society, instead of trying to save any labor costs and making people unemployed! It makes me feel terrible even to think about it that I create a company whose biggest contributions are to let thousands of people lose their jobs, save labor spending for insatiable people, increase the polarization between rich and poor, concentrate power in the hands of a very small number of people and in the end, make the people unable to make their life, leading to the desolation and even collapse of society...I can't imagine living in such a world, and even if it would make me the richest person in the world, it doesn't make sense. There are too many things in the world that can't be exchanged using the money. If I walk on the street and can't see people's happy smiles or leisurely paces, no cordial greetings, cares, or humors, and no sweet romantic love, but only see the homeless all over the place overwhelmed with pains, the stinking urinary smell they left behind goes into my nostrils, and wherever I go, I'm worried about being robbed, because people have no other way to live beside stealing and robbing...If artificial intelligence succeeds, this may be the final result. Fortunately, there is plenty of evidence that artificial intelligence is never going to be successful.***My artificial intelligence dream***Many people may not know that I used to be an \"AI fanatic.\" I have also been crazy about artificial intelligence, and deemed it as my \"great ideal.\" I also used to comment on \"human beings\" at every turn, as if the machine can be compared with human beings, or even higher than human beings. When Dark Blue defeated Kasparov, I once marveled: \"Oh, comes the doom of us human beings!\" I also thought that once there are two magic weapons (Oh, I'm joking. They're actually two slogans): \"logic\" and \"learning\", the machine will surpass human intelligence sooner or later. However, I did not figure out how this should be achieved, nor did I figure out the meanings for achieving this.The story begins more than a decade ago when artificial intelligence was in its winter. At the library of Tsinghua University, I stumbled upon a long-lost Peter Norvig's masterpiece, Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming (PAIP). Like an archaeologist, I began to ponder and implement the various classic AI algorithms. PAIP's algorithm focuses on logic and reasoning, because in its age, many AI researchers thought human intelligence, in the final analysis, is logical reasoning. They naively believe that with things like predicate logic, first-order logic, with abilities to express \"cause - result\", \"not only - but also\", what \"exists\", and what is \"for all\", the machines can have intelligence. So they designed a variety of logic-based algorithms, expert systems, and even designed the logic-based programming language Prolog, calling it \"the fifth generation programming language.\" In the end, they encountered insurmountable obstacles. Many AI companies could not achieve their boasted goals. Various \"neuron-based\" machines could not solve practical problems. Huge government and private investment were lost. Artificial intelligence entered its winter.I met PAIP in that winter. Although it didn't make me dedicated to the field of artificial intelligence, it made me fall in love with Lisp and programming language. It is also because of this book that for the first time I implemented the A* and other algorithms easily and in a structured way, and understood the true meaning of them. Also because of PAIP, I first understood what the \"modularity\" of a program is. I started using small \"tool functions\" in my own program instead of worrying about the \"function call overhead\" that many people are worried about. The two books, PAIP and SICP, led me to devote to the field of programming languages and be fortunate enough to get the guidance of the originators in this field.After PAIP, I was lost in machine learning for a while, because someone told me that machine learning is a new chapter in artificial intelligence. However, I gradually realized that the so-called artificial intelligence and machine learning have little to do with true human intelligence. As for the actual problems, the classic algorithm in PAIP is quite naive and complicated, and it is impossible to solve large-scale practical problems. The most important problem is that I don't see the algorithm in PAIP has anything to do with \"intelligent\". The term \"machine learning\" is completely nominal. As many people have found out, machine learning is, to be honest, just the \"fit function\" in statistics, replaced by a deceptive name.",

That amounts to 28% of the global workforce. Within five years, that figure will rise to between 38%, and in 10 years, 44%.>Those are compelling numbers, and while they dont equate to jobs that will be necessarily lost, the fact that AI will impact nearly half of the worlds employment in some way implies that we are looking at a change of a magnitude similar to that which followed[the 19th-century industrial revolution.](https://english.elpais.com/technology/2024-04-03/author-brian-merchant-luddites-are-more-dangerous-to-the-elites-and-to-the-rich-than-robin-hood.html)This is an industrial revolution that is growing exponentially. Its going to take less time to implement. We must make adjustments quickly and thats why we are carrying out this research, to send a message of caution, says Parrado. The goal of the index is to serve as a warning, so that, instead of having negative consequences, AI will bring benefits.",

As long as there is no ceiling to the amount and variety of things and services that humans want, you will not run out of jobs, and because humans desire interactions with other humans, you will not run out of jobs simply because machines are smarter. If that were actually the case, only engineers and scientists will have jobs in our modern world, and OnlyFans models would be on the streets in stead of in Lamborghini's. The real problem is not that jobs will go away, but the intermediate period when workers displaced by machines fail to find new jobs and instead turn to disastrous idiologies and newly machine empowered humans use their new powers in catastrophic ways.

It tested seven LLMs: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Amazon Nova, Meta Llama, and Alibaba Qwen.Their goal was to see how well the models could complete real world tasks and real world companies.They gave the AIs 175 different tasks you'd find in a typical workplace.Things like: Writing and fixing code Managing team projects Dealing with HR stuff Handling company financesHere is a summary of the results: The best-performing AI was Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Despite it being the best, Claude could complete 24% of its tasks. Each task relatively expensive, costing about $6.34 in computing power. The AI often needed around 30 attempts to figure things out. Other models, like GPT-4o took fewer steps, but their success rate was quite low (~14 steps). AI agents did best with technical stuff like coding. But struggled with things that required common sense and social skills. Sometimes the AIs would make up solutions instead of solving the problem.So what does this mean?As of today, AI is nowhere near ready to replace human workers.",

Without installing modules, connecting it to your software, without configuration, without excessive training. You download the agent at the press of a button from some website, then the AI will be able to fully control your computer, self learn on all the internal documents, play around with all the software so it knows how everything works. After having it for 24 hours, you meet with it one on one, and it will clarify its questions that it still has to do effective work. It will talk to you, show you graphics, show you stuff on the computer that it doesnt understand After that you check in with it once a week and it just does your job for you.If its stuck, it will email you or call you up on the phone",

Because AI isn't here to \"augment\" jobs - its automating them faster than we admit.Tech professionals used to believe that AI and cloud jobs were safe. Todays news proves otherwise. The biggest companies are cutting \"underperformers\" and replacing them with AI and cheaper labor.This isnt a reorg. This isnt \"business as usual.\" This is a wake-up call.

Underneath all the analysts research, the pop up shop vendors, the extension into the space from large ecosystem players such as Salesforce, there will be the core models and tooling to rapidly configure agents to perform relatively sophisticated tasks.Some companies will set up an agent configuration department, kinda like the prompt engineer role, itll serve to accelerate the adoption but eventually wont be needed.Others will pay big 4 consulting to do what takes 20 mins over 20 days. No one ever got fired for hiring <insert brand>.The biggest impact will be cost out. And thats human cost. Any repetitive and relatively contained job performed largely autonomously on a computer will be the target.Customer service, stock management, business process management. Put it this way, If you are gonna do the same thing today as you did yesterdaytheres gonna be an agent for that ;)Forget DOGE. Think DOBE. Someone set up an alt coin as well please.",

I got that thing to no only get *mad* at me, but *cut me off* and kill the conversation lmao.TL;DR $50 says that anyone who never had to work again would/*could* gladly spend their lives developing a talent better than any GPT ever could.

I'm not so anti-AI that I refuse to use it, I'm just concerned about how it will affect the industry as a whole.Even if AGI doesn't take over and replace humans entirely, there is the much more realistic possibility that AI allows one person to do the work of several and that will have a negative impact on the job market. Then again there are also theories that AI will just increase the expected output of a single developer so not everything I've seen is completely doom-and-gloom.",
