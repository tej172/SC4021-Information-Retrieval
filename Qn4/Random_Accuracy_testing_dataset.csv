Programming is gradually improving at a rate that was previously quite unexpected and could basically vacate all positions that aren't extremely senior skill level working on particularly complex projects, to which even those will eventually be lost. Stuff like improved translation, teaching, and more will continue to be faded out as the tech improves.Physical jobs are a bit more complicated. Often, the belief was manual labor jobs are immune to such risks but this is a false assumption.Technology like AI, advanced robotics, and 3D Printers can do a lot such as 3D printing houses, crafts including physical works, etc. or a hybrid system with robots utilized, too. They will do it better, too. We see self-driving cars finally getting major updates they've long needed like improved night vision/weather related technology advancements, less cutting corners and more advanced AI/processing capabilities, flight, and so forth not to mention legal incidents pushing back on them cutting corners that are actually harming the industry's growth.We're seeing factory robots starting to be phased in at some locations for early testing to replace jobs like parcel and FedEx where they're vastly more efficient (faster and more compact loads) at unpacking/packing trucks with packages, doing it with less damage, etc. or transporting and sorting.We have robotic technologies that are starting to be shown off with AI that can better understand spaces, identify the environment, follow orders with appropriate on the fly navigation/adjustment that is self-automated without additional input, capable of more precise actions compared to in the past, and able to adapt or handle a wider variety of tasks.Farmers are already seeing tractors, albeit fairly expensive ones, that can do nearly all the work on a farm with no humans for produce. The simple reality is it is coming fast, and much of it like non-manual labor jobs, can be phased out in literal weeks when a company thinks its worth it... maybe after doing a small scale test run or none at all. Physical labor jobs like plumbing, construction, parcel delivery, warehouse, lab work, etc. will depend on how fast the hardware can be rolled out. Further, there could be supplies / financial expense limitations that make hardware based ones slower to roll out depending on the company and overall demand / manufacturing abilities. Honestly, if you want to see a good representation of what to expect in the future look at Deus Ex Human Revolution's story which covers similar themes.

Their new job - if they find one, may not give them free time to look to find a better job.

There's no link to AI here.Anecdotally; I can tell you all about the layoffs in a couple of big companies in Australia if you like. I know many many people working there and AI is the last thing being discussed or worked on. Its not even a factor these companies are usually thinking about yet, and when they do its all about ""how can AI make our product better"" because noone has the vaguest clue where to begin with ""replacing engineers with AI"". That's still science-fiction and you're getting waaaay ahead of yourself.Would shareholders believe it though? And then pressure a company to make layoffs based on their Dunning-Kruger level understanding of the tech industry?

They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations [1].Although Im going to discuss how the study comes with a set of imperfections, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.*Lets dive in and take an*exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets*!*# What They DidThe study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.The researchers used the[O*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html)which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct exposure of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.To reiterate, a higher exposure means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that lets look at their results.# Key FindingsThe study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:* Programming and writing skills* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)* Higher levels of education (Bachelors and up)Lower levels of exposure are associated with:* Science and critical thinking skills* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robotsThis is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.*This time its the suits!*If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.# Necessary CriticismFirst, lets address the elephant in the room!OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.*But theres more!*The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what affected by or exposed to LLMs actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.# Take-Away And ImplicationsGPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.Jokes aside!What an exciting time for science and humanity!As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found value in it!If you are not subscribed to the newsletter yet,[click here to sign up](https://thedecoding.net/)!

4685,"The Industrial Revolution took away people's jobs in factories and other industries because machines could produce 10x faster than a human worker at 1/10th of the cost, making them 100 times more efficient.However, this did not lead to massive unemployment, because more jobs were able to be made. Why? Because the Industrial Revolution allowed businesses to grow in massive scale and hire many more employees for new, necessary tasks.A shoe producer maybe had 100 factory workers, and needed 100 more employees to run advertising and other operations in the business, for a total of 200 employees. When the machines came in and replaced the factory workers, it meant a loss of 100 jobs. However, the business grew in such size and scale due to the increased shoe production capabilities that they needed to hire 400 more employees to run operations and advertising. Instead of serving just a local market, they had the ability to produce enough shoes to serve a much larger market.As you can see, the introduction of machines led to job losses in the production jobs. However, it led to an increase in operations jobs, because the increased productivity of the business meant that more people had to be hired to scale the business. This increase in growth leads to more people being hired for new roles than fired for old roles.So instead of needing 100 factory workers and 100 operations, they needed 10 factory workers and 500 operations. NOTE THAT THE INCREASED NUMBER OF OPERATIONS ROLES WAS NEEDED BECAUSE SO MANY MORE SHOES WERE BEING PRODUCED. THE BUSINESS WAS MUCH LARGER THAN BEFORE AND NEEDED MORE EMPLOYES TO RUN THE BUSINESS IN NEW AREAS AND NEW MARKETS.How does this relate to LLMs and ChatGPT?LLMs are going to replace lots of operations roles in businesses, such as receptionist, customer service, communications, advertising, etc. Just like machines replaced roles in factories.However, unemployment will depend ON IF BUSINESSES NEED TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE FOR NEW ROLES.Remember, during the industrial revolution, businesses needed to hire more people for operations roles, because they were growing in size and scale due to their increased productivity. This growth of the business and need for employees outweighed the number of factory jobs that were replaced.LLMs are going to replace operations roles within businesses. But the question is whether the businesses will grow in productivity and require hiring in new areas that outweighs the roles being replaced.And the answer is obviously not.First of all, there are only two parts to a business. The production and the operation. You need to make the product and then you need to run the business (advertising, communication, decisions, managing, ect).In the industrial revolution, production jobs were decreased, but this led to a massive increase in operations roles.However, in the LLM revolution, operations jobs will decrease, and that is it.There is not a 3rd category to increase jobs in.Also note that businesses are already as large as can be. During the industrial revolution, businesses could grow bigger than ever before because they could produce more products than ever before. So they started to grow, and of course hire more people.Today, however, businesses are already as large and competitive as they can be. There is no growth available that will lead to a need for hiring new people.This means that LLMs will replace many roles in businesses, but no new roles will be needed, because there wont be much business growth. The industrial revolution allowed businesses to grow and this growth meant that more people needed to be hired. However, in the LLM revolution, business will not grow, they will stay the same size while reducing costs.Anybody who is hopeful and says that ""we will find new jobs for people to do"" is basing that off of the fact that people found new jobs after the industrial revolution. However, new roles were not created after the industrial revolution for any reason other than the fact that businesses grew in size, and required more employees to manage this growth.LLM's are not going to grow businesses. This is because they don't produce anything. A machine could produce 100x more shirts than a human could, which means the business could sell 100x more shirts, and therefore the business would need more employees to manage this growth.An LLM can write 100x more emails than a human, but this is does not grow a business. It just makes a business more efficient.Please understand this:Machines = More production of goods = Business growth = more jobsLLM's do not produce goods and therefore they will not grow businesses. They will increase business profits by reducing costs (less employees needed). But they will not produce products, which means businesses will not grow, which means business will not hire more employees.The only way we can increase employment during the LLM Revolution is for many new businesses to be created. Existing businesses will lay off more than they hire. But new businesses that sell new products could lead to more jobs.New businesses and existing businesses will have much different employment structures.Before the industrial revolution, most employees worked in the factories.Before the LLM revolution, most employees worked in operations.But after the LLM revolution, businesses will be very lean. The marketing department of a business will have much fewer employees, who all know how to use AI tools to for massive scale. Instead of requiring 100 customer service reps to reply to emails, you might have a team of 5 for customer service who use AI at scale.The only way we do not have massive unemployment is for a large amount of new businesses to be created, because businesses in general will require much less employees.If you want a conspiracy theory, I believe that Andrew Tate is a government hired influencer who has a purpose of influencing young men to start businesses, in a social engineering effort to prepare for the massive unemployment coming soon. If we can inspire young men to start businesses, perhaps we can curtail unemployment from LLM's by having more businesses come into existence.

Artificial Intelligence experienced a boom post-COVID-19 with the rise of ChatGPT and other LLMs (Large Language Models). As we know, LLMs have received wide acceptance in society, which has, however, raised concerns about whether AI will replace us as humans.I have had to unlearn and relearn the dynamics of AI and understand how far it has come to be part of our lives. What we may not realize is that AI has been with us since our great-grandparents' time; we just didnt recognize it. Think about it: we use navigation systems in our cars and mobile devices, facial recognition, biometrics, weather forecasts on our phones, and more. AI has been there, ever-growing like a seed, becoming more advanced and smarter.So, the question again: will AI take over our jobs? The answer is no. Artificial intelligence is here to enhance our productivity and help us work smarter, not to replace us. Here are some things I learned: AI for Business, Building a Website, Making Audio with AI, Making Animations with AI, Making and Editing Videos, Buzzwords in AI, Prompt Engineering, LLMs, GenAI, Finding Remote Jobs, LinkedIn Optimization, ATS for CVs and Cover Letters, and Acing Interviews, among others.Thank you ALX Ghana for this opportunity.",positive,"['Education & Training', 'Technology & IT', 'Human Resources & Talent Management', 'Entertainment & Media', 'Non-Profit & Social Services']",,

I work in the title insurance industry and even witj AI's current capabilities my job could be done by it. That is if our county would index recorded documents properly. 90% of the research side of my job is literally just pulling documents/pdf's of a properties history of transfers. Then compiling those and putting them in to a neat put together word document(commitment is what we call it) as needed for each file. The 10% that AI couldn't currently do is due to OCR limitations and the shit handwriting it would need to decipher at times to accurately recognize text on a deed or other documents.Our system that we use for indexing documents each day would be the limiting factor at the moment. Too archaic of software for AI to be able to integrate with it at all as well as the OCR limitation I mentioned above. The escrow side of title insurance isn't really at risk at the moment imo. Atleast until they get the privacy of customers information figured out and that worry isn't at the front of a companies mind when they think of using AI. I figure I'll just make use of AI as I can for now until it does eventually replace me and do my best to learn enough python that I can be the one to put something together to do my job for me before someone else does. It's nice being able to throw together a barely cohesive email, throw it at ChatGPT and ask it to make some sense of it and make it professional so I can send it to whomever. Or using AI with OCR to export a super long legal description from a scanned doc to a text format to then be able to just copy n paste it as needed. Saves me like 5 minutes or so lol.

An example of this is a video game company, for example Rockstar. If video game designers are to all be replaced by an efficient AGI, whos to say these designers, who have industry experience, cant then create their own video games using the same cheap technology that made them redundant. This goes for almost all white collar work in fact.

Customers will be eating food that has never been handled by humans.The only reason they havent done it yet is because they know that change will cause enormous repercussions through society, and nobody wants to be the first. Sooner or later, someone is going to jump, and then the rest will follow, and MILLIONS of people will lose their jobs, permanently. The same is going to happen in offices, where plenty if tasks can be done faster and more accurately by AI. Even creative jobs will be taken by AI. A large part of the Hollywood writer's strike was to limit the use of AI in authoring scripts. The writers won this round, but they'll lose sooner or later. Most TV and movie scripts are formulaic anyway, it wont be hard for AI to recreate them. At some point, we are likely to have a PERMANENT unemployment rate of 50%, and we will have to figure out what to do with those people. There are basically two choices - Universal Basic Income (UBI) or reduce the population by 50%.

The reality is more complex.AI is definitely automating repetitive tasks things like data entry, customer support chatbots, and even some manufacturing processes.

The demand for AI engineers, data scientists, and even AI ethics specialists is growing.
