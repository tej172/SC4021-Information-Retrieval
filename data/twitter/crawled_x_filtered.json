The next set of well-paid tech workforce will be the folks with sound math knowledge, who can\n\n- tune and build AI to get mundane work done quickly\n- tune AI to discover things that were not \"possible\" by humans\n\nAI will definitely make us more productive but at the cost of rendering mundane work redundant, forming the future service sector (derived from prompt engineering).\n\nmore pointers - https://t.co/Mq13VYVHZR\n\nif you have a keen interest in math, pursue it. if not, try to build it. because if not you, your descendants will be needing it.\n\nps: I could be wrong; but this is what I could see happening 20 years down the line, conservatively.",

Two dimensions I see:\n\n1. Notarizing authenticity in amidst an explosion of creation where you don't know whats real \u2014\n\nAI is going to create an explosion of images, audio, software. It will be hard to distinguish what's real from whats not. Amidst this, defending against spoofing, deepfakes, people copying work, verifying the creation/ creator/ person you're talking to will be important. Pub/ private key cryptography, zk proofs and the like can play a major role, and blockchains can deploy with standards at scale with implicit trust.\n\n2. AI Agents need to transact, hold balances, store information, etc without behind a person. \n\nAutonomous AI agents that can action projects and tasks will give rise to new needs. But Agents are not a person, and will you want them running around the internet with your credit card, social, and PII signing as you? How will they have a budget they can spend? How will they sign contracts? How will they escrow things with one another? etc. Blockchains, stablecoins, smart contracts, defi, and things not yet created will be natively useful. \n\nStill developing thoughts here ofc and interested in the thinking of others. Overall, feeling increasingly convinced that these two disparate technologies are going to have intertwined futures, and that crypto is going to become a lot more important as AI starts to proliferate.",

        "text": "I get that, I do. But artists need to accept that AI exists now and we are never going back. And yes, jobs will be displaced, just like we don't have telephone operators anymore. Heres a controversial opinion: \"Commercial artists\" are not above being displaced any more than any other industry. Just because they work in a historically high skill but low pay job, it does not grant them special prevlidges above anyone else. \n\nThere is a differennce between commercial artists and \"artists\", the kind of person that creates for themselves, and they create because there is nothing else they would rather do, and the end result of their artwork is never the point, it's the process. These artists will never have to worry because that is something that can never be taken from them.\n\nJohn Bitcoin, whoever that is, is just a modern day grifter. The art world has always been full of them, and the art world is manipulated, by curators, all the way up to the CIA, and that's not a conspiracy theory - you can look up why Pollock and de Kooning rose to fame. It doesn't matter. It's always been this way. It changes nothing.\n\nThis whole anti ai art thing stinks of manufactured outrage and elitism. I've been creating traditional art for twenty years, and suddenly people who never stepped foot in a gallery alone condescending judge me for messing around with Midjouney for fun. I am pro freedom of mind, spirit and choice, anyone who watched Interface should understand that yet its evident many people never saw it beyond the surface one liners.\n\nI really feel for these artists who show nothing but disdain for recent art related technology, they are going to miss an opportunity to learn about something because the internet told them to. They aren't even giving themselves the opportunity to make their own opinions by trying it, learning about it, then rejecting it, they are succumbing to toxic group think immediately and to hell with anyone else who dares do something different.\n\nIt reminds me of the time I went to a  job interview at film co-op and they looked down on me for not using \"film\", but digital cameras. It also really reminds me of YouTube back in 2005-2012 era, where a lot of talented filmmakers would opt out of using YouTube over Vimeo, because of some abstract moralistic qualm about mixing art among shitposts, or ads or maintaining some idealized professional image. Little did they know they missed out of building an audience on a platform that would become the one of the biggest gifts to independent filmmaking we've seen. \n\nThere are copyright issues with AI, I get it. But artists do not own copyright over \"styles\". Artists that are nothing more that their styles, might be forced to reconcile the fact their artwork is an empty shell with no meaning inside it. They need to accept that they don't control the way aesthetics are manufactured, they never did, and they should question why they are creating art in the first place if they more worried about what *other* artists are doing.\n\nTelling an artist \"you can't do that\", words as old as time.",

I'm sure I'm missing a lot of things here. But I see a lot of posts saying \"Hollywood is doomed\" or \"The Music Industry is on it's last leg.\" I just don't buy any of it. Humans love seeing other talented humans.\n\nThis is getting a bit \"out there\" but I believe, over time, humans and robots/AI will further merge. Smart phones already augment our brains. We already wear stat-trackers on our wrists or fingers. We have access to the world's knowledge in our pockets. We put listening devices in our ears. We'll soon be wearing glasses that put data in front of our eyes all of the time. I believe the future is more of a symbiotic relationship between human and machine and not an adversarial one. \n\nBut who knows, I could be way off, and The Terminator was actually just a documentary about our future...\n\nWhat is some hype that you believe and hype that you absolutely do not believe?",
