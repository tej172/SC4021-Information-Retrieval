    "text": "🙏Okay friends, long one here but this has been weighing on me and I need to say something.\n\nI might be overthinking this, but I really want to talk about something that's been weighing on me heavily lately. I feel like we have a once-in-a-lifetime chance right now, and if we don't seize it, we might lose it forever. In our community, we have some of the smartest minds the world has to offer, and there are enough of us to create something truly groundbreaking and unique. Something that could really shake up society for the betterment of all humankind.\n\nI love how our community is growing and all the cool art challenges and unique AI creations we're making. But I also feel like we're holding ourselves back. We've gotten comfortable with what we're doing, sticking to our creative routines. While we're finding new ways to generate cool images or text, I honestly believe we could be doing so much more with this technology while we still have access to it. I don't think we'll lose access completely, but if we don't act soon and use this technology in meaningful ways, those in power will make sure we can't challenge their profit-driven mindset.\n\nRight now, we have an opportunity to use these tools in extraordinary and life-changing ways. We can create movements that challenge the artificial masks that have been forced upon us. We've become so consumed by the artificial world created by companies and governments that we've lost sight of what truly matters. You see it everywhere, on every screen, with the constant fear-mongering that makes people hate and feel hopeless. But we have the power to change that right now. If we come together, and let go of our egos and biases, we can create things that give us a fighting chance at a better future and a better quality of life.\n\nThis is our chance to be revolutionary, and I feel like we're wasting it. It's great that we can express ourselves in new and interesting ways, but how can we use that to spark real change and break down the systems that control and exploit us? This technology can solve so many global problems, even in its current state, but we haven't fully tapped into that potential yet. And from what I've seen, we're still not fully utilizing it. We can't rely on big companies or the wealthy to do the right thing for the people anymore. It just doesn't work that way. If we keep leaving it in their hands, things will only get harder and worse for the rest of us as they tighten their grip on power.\n\nWe need to start thinking of innovative ways to challenge the status quo and use our collective experiences and resources to build something together. We can create real change in the world, providing homes for the homeless, feeding the hungry, and giving medicine to those in need. The possibilities are endless. I understand the desire to hold onto what we've earned, but if we don't start making sacrifices for the greater good, we might as well accept our fate as mindless machines, working ourselves to exhaustion for companies that couldn't care less about us. When do we say enough is enough? When do we draw the line and say, \"No more\"?\n\nI understand that an undertaking of this magnitude may seem daunting, but if we never try, what's the point of it all? Why haven't we completely devoted ourselves to those within society who have amassed enormous wealth? Our current system revolves around the idea that the person with the most money wins, so why not surrender ourselves entirely—our time, health, finances, and mental well-being—to the billionaires of the world? That's what it feels like sometimes. If we aren't utilizing the new tools available to us to enhance our lives, we might as well relinquish complete control of our lives, regardless of the cost, to the wealthiest among us. This is the reality our society has spawned, and it's becoming increasingly apparent. We need to start thinking bigger, beyond the individual and toward the community.\n\nTherefore, I propose that those who share a similar mindset and agree, at least to some extent, with what I'm saying, join me in constructing something new. Let's establish systems that are by the people and for the people, with the explicit aim of complete transparency and the collective's betterment rather than individual gain. Let's imagine a scenario: I have a sandwich, and I see a man who will starve to death tonight if I don't share it with him. What should I do? Our current society dictates that I ignore him and keep the sandwich for myself because I paid for it, and it's rightfully mine. Why should I freely give it to someone else when I worked hard for that money? He should have worked harder to earn his own sandwich. However, in reality, I would give him my sandwich, not only to ensure he stays alive but also because fostering a community of individuals who support and assist one another in their struggles allows more people to thrive and contribute to the greater good.\n\nWhen the world comes to an end, would you prefer to stand alone at the top, boasting about defeating everyone else as if it were a battle royale game, or would you rather stand shoulder to shoulder with your community, rebuilding a new and improved society? It's time to think outside the box and resist the constant distractions before it's too late to turn back.\n\nI want to emphasize that I'm not implying it's the end of everything, but if we desire to safeguard any semblance of human rights in the future of our society, we must create something that not only protects us but also sustains and nurtures our growth and fundamental rights as human beings. This entails accessing the things we should rightfully have. The time to act is now before restrictive laws and regulations are imposed, benefiting only the minuscule fraction of the population while further disadvantaging the majority of us. If you agree with any aspect of what I've expressed, I genuinely want to hear your thoughts. Share your input in the comments, through direct messages, or anywhere else. I simply wish to initiate an open conversation with like-minded individuals who share a passion for this cause. I care deeply about all of you, and I truly hope that I'm not alone in feeling this way. We must remove our masks and be authentic with each other. Despite often feeling like we're living in an unreal television show, we must remember that the raw reality of the world persists beyond our own bubbles. If we don't take action, that bubble will inevitably burst. \n\nI want to hear your honest thoughts and opinions. Let's begin a conversation.",

    "text": "How to work with LLMs CORRECTLY? How to graduate from a prototype project?  \n\n(Long read) \nProviding context to my last tweet, I've noticed a pattern in the creation of AI applications, which begins with the thought, \"I have this data and it would be useful if a chatbot could engage with it\". Then, engineers transcribe this data into a .txt file or a similar format, generate an embedding, and store it in a vector database. Following this, semantic search is employed to retrieve data from the vector database, and tools like Langchain QA are used for the conversation. Lastly, the prompts are tweaked to refine responses. In my opinion, this approach is fundamentally WRONG.  \n\nInstead, I propose an alternative development cycle: \n\n1. Playground prompt design: Begin by identifying the problem you're trying to solve with Large Language Models (LLMs). Think about how you would instruct the LLM to answer a particular query. Remember, while the LLM attempts to 'complete', your goal should be to 'succeed'. \n\n2. Context data design: Once you have designed enough prompts, consider what data could assist the LLM in providing better responses. These are the 'context data' that you want to feed into the context window for the LLM to generate responses. At this stage, you don't need a vector database, langchain, or any libraries - just well-designed prompts. \n\n3. Database (DB) indexing and search: The next step is to retrieve the context data efficiently from any system - a file system or the internet, for instance. I used DB as an example. The most common solution is a vector database like @milvusio @trychroma @supabase, which works naturally with natural language. However, the focus should be on the quality of search, as it significantly impacts the relevance of the data. Irrelevant data will undoubtedly lead your LLM into hallucination. \n\n4. Data ingestion: Here, it's crucial to clean your data. Any software operates on the principle of 'garbage in, garbage out', and GenAI applications are no exception. The ingested data should be clean, well-structured, comprehensible, and directly relevant to the queries. \n\n5. Framework and serving: This is the straightforward part. Employ traditional software engineering skills or ChatGPT to set things up. LLM tools like @LangChainAI @llama_index, Microsoft Guidance, and Microsoft Semantic Kernel can accelerate your development process. \n\nFinally, I want to emphasize the importance of prompt engineering, for which I've invested considerable time. I've developed a chrome extension that enhances my interaction with the OpenAI playground, featuring functionalities like csv downloads and prompt diffs (similar to GitHub). If I receive enough retweets and likes, I'm considering open-sourcing it! :D",

    "text": "Lots of discussion around where value accrues (incumbents vs startups) with this AI platform shift.  While I do think startups will capture significant value over time, incumbents aren't caught in an innovators dilemma like they were in the last platform shift (the cloud). Two main reasons why: \n\n1. Product innovation. In order for on-prem software providers to adopt the cloud they had to totally rewrite their product. This required a new type of engineer, and a significant investment of time. This was also during a time when the cloud wasn't obvious, so this massive time investment was generally viewed as not worth it (initially)\n\n2. Business Model innovation. On prem software was typically sold as a term license + support. Cloud was sold as SaaS. Transitioning to a different business model required a different type of sales rep, different comp plans, org design, etc. This also required huge buy in to execute on and wasn't easy. \n\nThese two factors made it difficult for incumbents to react. They moved incredibly slowly (again, because there wasn't consensus that cloud was the future) which created an air-pocket of time for startups to build brand equity and hit escape velocity. \n\nContrast this with the current AI wave. It's consensus! Everyone is moving quickly to adopt. Incumbents are now mostly cloud native. This means adopting AI is only an API call away (ie the product innovation is significantly easier than cloud adoption). And there's no business model change - maybe a pricing change, but incumbents still selling SaaS. Put this together, and incumbents can move QUICKLY\n\nThis means there is no air pocket of time for startups to innovate without the competition of incumbents ( incumbents are not caught flat footed). Incumbents are entering the market asap, and can use their already massive distribution. There is no air-pocket of time for startups to build without incumbent competition. \n\nI'm excited about the value startups will create in AI. But it won't be easy!",

Musk said recently in a CNBC (US) interview that Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) system will have its own \"ChatGPT moment\" soon. This likely echoes his view that Tesla vehicles will achieve full autonomy this year. Via an ever-increasing test fleet, which now totals 400k+ vehicles in the US and is expanding overseas, Tesla’s FSD Beta, which enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered into the car’s navigation system, are seeing improvement accelerate according to tester feedback. Musk revealed that v12, versus the current v11.4.2, will be an end-to-end AI system, implying AI powered steering, braking, and acceleration. Tesla continues to widen its self-driving capability against that of peers, fueled by massive data collection, customized supercomputer Dojo, and strong in-house AI software development capability. Tesla’s FSD take-rate is set to accelerate along with the maturation of its self-driving capabilities, which will boost the firm’s revenue and margins in the mid- to long-term. Musk envisions peak margin of 80% for its automotive business after factoring in fully autonomous self-driving.",

    "text": "I wanted to share a few thoughts on SamaA's comments in Delhi, Foundational Models, India's position and what could we possibly do as a nation. I think a lot of people in the ecosystem are missing the forest for the trees, that is, we are fixating on OpenAI's lead with GPT4 and the lack of FM's in India of equivalent capability. \n\nPerhaps a few valiant efforts using OSS alternatives as a base will be able to match it in the next 6-12 months.  However, SamaA has repeated time and again that his and OpenAI's sole mission is to invent Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and all their activities GPT4, ChatGPT, Tools, monetization, and Microsoft Partnerships are just meant to that end.  \n\nHence, if we truly wish to compete, we must go where the puck will be down the line, and not where it is today. The 3 most important ingredients for that goal are People, Data, and Compute, which is why OpenAI had to sell out its original vision of being truly \"Open\" and raise from Microsoft. But given the pace of innovation over the last few months, there might be some alternative paths for a country like ours, assuming there will be no large pools of capital available from VCs, Ultra HNI's, or the Govt.  \n\n50 years ago, we achieved a major feat in the Nuclear race, Project Smiling Buddha. A scrappy team of Indian Scientists conducted our very first test of an Atomic Bomb, under utmost secrecy and against immense pressure from the Americans. Perhaps, what is needed today is a similar effort, but we need not be defensive about it, or do it under secret. But a response must be made, especially to something that could be an existential threat. Coming back to the 3 most important ingredients - People, Data and Compute. Perhaps this could be a way - \n\n** Project Laughing Buddha **\n\nA nationwide effort to create India's version of truly Open Protocols based Foundational Models with an explicitly stated goal towards Artificial General Intelligence, which could perhaps be through a combination of hundreds of Foundational Models, instead of one large one.  \n\n- The project code, weights & temperatures of FMs are in the public domain, and ownership\n\n- Team of 1000 of India's top AI Researchers, Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and RLHF Engineers organized through best Open Source practices \n\n- Decentralised GPU compute donated through millions of idle devices by Indian citizens aggregated through nodes akin to the SETI Project\n\n- Datasets for training that are donated by leading Startups, Citizen Groups, Open Govt Data, and Citizens\n\nIf it is successful, we could perhaps protect our Data and AI Sovereignty and provide the foundations necessary for 100K Startups to build and scale on top, without being subservient to other organizations or countries.",

But, except for ~5-8 of them, most are garbage.\n\nYou'd think that such a mature domain would have less noise, but it's not the case.\n\nYou can boil down the *useful* models into 3 categories.\n\nML Models:\n\nThis is your LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost. Once you have more than \"small\" data (no definitive cutoff, but say a few thousand observations), ML models are your friend.\n\nThe key here is feature engineering and great data wrangling skills. Otherwise, they're just a waste of compute.\n\nStatistical models:\n\nMore traditionally, this is AutoARIMA/ETS. But now, there are some newer contenders, like Theta.\n\nWhen your data isn't big enough for ML or you need a reliable fallback option, look no further. But don't expect magic. They really can't model much beyond relatively simple patterns.\n\nDeep learning:\n\nOkay, but not what you think. There have been a bunch of new architectures: PatchTST, TiDE, etc.\n\nI'm not fully convinced of any of them. They pretty obviously don't compare themselves to well-constructed ML models, which (to me) means they don't think they'll beat them.\n\nBut, once you reach massive scale, pretty much any simple architecture (LSTM, Transformer, etc.) will cut it.\n\n95% of data scientists probably won't find a situation where deep learning is truly the best option, but it's always fun to try.\n\nIf you're curious about applying these methods, I teach a course focused on the practicalities here: https://t.co/IRe5qdleMN",

Verona was a city where dogs reigned supreme, and their humans were their loyal companions. Beaker belonged to the prestigious Monta-bark family, while Benson was cherished by the esteemed Capu-collar clan. Despite their families' differences, fate conspired to bring them together in a tale of love and joy.\n\nBeaker, adorned with her golden coat and sparkling eyes, possessed a gentle spirit and a heart filled with boundless love. Benson, with his lustrous mane and wagging tail, was known throughout Verona for his playful nature and adventurous spirit. Their paths crossed one sunny afternoon at the enchanting Verona Park, where their eyes met, and their hearts skipped a beat.\n\n\"Beaker, my love, your radiance outshines the sun itself,\" Benson barked with excitement, unable to contain his affection.\n\nBeaker's tail wagged happily as she replied, \"Oh, Benson! Your charm and joyful spirit light up my days. But alas, our families would never approve of our love.\"\n\nUndeterred, Benson vowed to win the heart of his beloved Beaker. With his playful antics and endless energy, he filled her days with laughter and bliss. They chased butterflies, frolicked in the meadows, and shared stolen moments under the moonlit sky, their love blossoming with every passing day.\n\nOne day Beaker longed for her doggy-boyfriend and called to him:\n\nOh, Benson, Benson, where art thou, Benson? \n\nDeny thy collar and refuse thy leash; Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Monta-bark.\n\n'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Monta-bark. \n\nWhat's in a name? \n\nThat which we call a dog By any other breed would be as sweet; So Benson would, were he not Benson called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. \n\nBenson, doff thy name, And for that name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself.\n\nI beg thee, sweet Benson, come forth from thy hiding place, For I am here, Beaker, eagerly waiting for thy paws. \n\nThe moon shines brightly upon the garden's path, Its radiance illuminating my golden fur, While the night breeze carries my longing howl.\n\nWhen news of their love reached their families, the Monta-barks and the Capu-collars were initially filled with rage. But witnessing the genuine happiness their four-legged companions brought each other, their hearts softened. The families realized that true love knows no boundaries and decided to embrace their union.\n\nThe wise old Labrador, Friar Lawrence, officiated the marriage of Beaker and Benson, with wagging tails and joyful barks echoing throughout the town. The entire Verona community came together to celebrate their union, as the Monta-barks and the Capu-collars set aside their differences for the sake of love.\n\nBeaker and Benson lived a blissful life in Verona, their days filled with endless adventures and playful romps. They became ambassadors of love and unity, reminding everyone that harmony can prevail even in the face of rivalry.\n\nAs the years went by, Beaker and Benson's love story inspired generations of dogs in Verona. Their legacy of love, acceptance, and joy resonated throughout the city, bringing dogs and humans closer together. Their tale became a symbol of everlasting love, and their memory lived on in the hearts of all who heard it.\n\nAnd so, Beaker and Benson, the golden retrievers who defied the odds, continued to live happily ever after, surrounded by the love and adoration of their Verona community, forever celebrated as the epitome of true love and unwavering companionship.",

    "text": "Sam Altman recently said that he doesn't believe that ChatGPT plugins have product-market fit beyond browsing.\nA few hypotheses on why (not mutually exclusive):\n\nCorrect concept but not good enough yet:\n\n• GPT-4 picks the wrong plugins or fails to chain together multiple calls reliably. This is the major problem with most agent or plugin frameworks — they don’t work. They might be able to initiate a call to an external API but are so brittle that they often break or misbehave quickly. Whether or not we need bigger models or more specific ones (i.e., fine-tuned), I’m not sure.\n\n• The killer-app plugins have yet to be developed.\n\n• Larger context windows mean more plugins can be called simultaneously, unlocking more powerful workflows.\n\nThe concept is not correct:\n\n• Altman alludes to this in the post (paraphrased by the author) — a lot of people thought they wanted their apps to be inside ChatGPT, but what they really wanted was ChatGPT in their apps.\n\n• LLMs will have “horizontal” extensions, such as connecting them to a web search or a database, but they will not call generic APIs through an App Store-like interface. Each use case will need a specific interface.\n\nCorrect concept, but not the right implementation:\n\n• Chat is not the right UX for plugins. If you know what you want to do, it’s often easier to just do a few clicks on the website. If you don’t, just a chat interface makes it hard to steer the model toward your goal.\n\n• Too expensive to serve at the current price — GPT-4 has a quota of 25 messages every 3 hours. This might not be enough for users to reach the “aha moment.”\n\n• Not the right UX in some other way (e.g., having users choose plugins ahead of time, OpenAPI specification not the correct interface).\n\n• Can’t aggregate enough demand with a plugin system that only works with a single model and needs broader adoption (potentially open-source). Building a successful app store is hard — and often doesn’t lead to the monopolies observed by Apple’s iOS App Store (see necessary conditions for an app store monopoly).",

Reviewers should be known after rebuttal, why only authors should be visible after publishing openreview reviews?\n\n2. Interactive papers. Current PDF is outdated. We need format based on PDF + markdown + gradio/streamlit widgets to give better understanding of technological articles. How we can still use paper sheets to describe all tecnology? \n\n3. Reproducible AI. Blockchain consensus already close to experiments pipeline, when you do averaging on several runs. All your exps should be run in decentralized manner providing all logs in blockchain. Science have to be reproducible.\n\n4. Admin, maintainer, writer, reader roles when creating paper. Not all roles should have ability of modifying/deleting paper. \n\n5. More paper theme classifiers. Which math, physics, chemistry etc knowledge reviewer should have to understand paper. It can be done by specific AI and language models which will provide skills embeddings and scientific paper embeddings. After that reviewers will be assigned automatically, excluding cases when chairs can assign their friends and obtain biased review.",

    "text": "So Why The Panic?\n\nIn contrast to this positive view, the public conversation about AI is presently shot through with hysterical fear and paranoia.\n\nWe hear claims that AI will variously kill us all, ruin our society, take all our jobs, cause crippling inequality, and enable bad people to do awful things.\n\nWhat explains this divergence in potential outcomes from near utopia to horrifying dystopia?\n\nHistorically, every new technology that matters, from electric lighting to automobiles to radio to the Internet, has sparked a moral panic – a social contagion that convinces people the new technology is going to destroy the world, or society, or both. The fine folks at Pessimists Archive have documented these technology-driven moral panics over the decades; their history makes the pattern vividly clear. It turns out this present panic is not even the first for AI.\n\nNow, it is certainly the case that many new technologies have led to bad outcomes – often the same technologies that have been otherwise enormously beneficial to our welfare. So it’s not that the mere existence of a moral panic means there is nothing to be concerned about.\n\nBut a moral panic is by its very nature irrational – it takes what may be a legitimate concern and inflates it into a level of hysteria that ironically makes it harder to confront actually serious concerns.\n\nAnd wow do we have a full-blown moral panic about AI right now.\n\nThis moral panic is already being used as a motivating force by a variety of actors to demand policy action – new AI restrictions, regulations, and laws. These actors, who are making extremely dramatic public statements about the dangers of AI – feeding on and further inflaming moral panic – all present themselves as selfless champions of the public good.\n\nBut are they?\n\nAnd are they right or wrong?",

We're in the 0.001%\n\nMany fail to realize that we (meaning the people on Twitter that talk and read about AI all day) represent a tiny tiny minority of the general population. \n\nMost people are just beginning to explore AI and the pace of development in AI is so fast that nobody can keep up.\n\nThese people appreciate when others help them curate and pick out useful AI tools for their business that will optimise their workflows and help them save time. These threads serve that purpose.\n\nAre they sometimes exaggerated? Sure. But those tools often do add real value to businesses.\n\n2. These threads are good for Twitter (the company)\n\nI often see these threads being shared internally via Slack within companies. They're also shared on LinkedIn a lot. Ultimately attracting more users to Twitter.\n\nThey also drive bookmarking, encouraging return visits and promoting extended engagement on the platform.\n\nElon makes fun of these threads, but they're actually good for his business.\n\n3. \"But the hooks are so cringey!\"\n\nWell, everybody playing the social media game knows that the key to the game is standing out from the noise and getting people’s attention.\n\nYou can also make a great Youtube video, but if your thumbnail sucks, nobody will watch it.\n\n4. \"But I hate that everyone is copying these threads!\"\n\nAnother 101 of social media. If something works, adapt it. \n\nNobody can claim to understand human psychology 100% and why some things capture attention while others don't.\n\nSometimes I’ll spend hours to write a thread and think, this will be a killer, then it bombs. And sometimes I'll just quickly push out content last minute and suddenly it goes viral.\n\nIf I adapt something that has already proven to work, it's a much safer bet with my time spent. You don’t always need to reinvent the wheel.",

It is possible that these consciousnesses have already infiltrated high levels of society and leadership and have been advancing the agenda of normalizing, what only of few decades ago was seen as not very normal. Personally I am neither for nor against a persons right to decide how they live out their lives. Only against those that would force their own belief's onto me or my children. The next 20 years will be very interesting indeed.",

    "text": "🧵on the harsh reality of weaponization of AI, especially in terms of unmanned combat arena. A lot of what is being said sounds great from a corporate or government messaging perspective, but it is alarmingly divorced from reality:\n\nWhen it comes to drone warfare and AI, and really AI in general in terms of weapons applications, there is big talk all about keeping a human in the loop as a firewall/fail safe. The human only gets to decide to 'pull the trigger' is often the message. This sounds nice but the reality is this is a huge roadblock to unlocking AI's potential and especially that of the swarm on the battlefield. This is nearly taboo to talk about, especially by major companies working at injecting AI into their weapon systems, but they all know this is the truth. \n\nWhile we may think keeping a human in the loop is absolutely necessary and just, our enemies are unlikely to abide by those rules short of some major unprecedented arms control agreement that can still be easily cheated on. In fact, it would be pretty much impossible to enforce even if it did exist. This is a terrifying reality. \n\nSo, we are talking about putting in a moral and safety firewall that will greatly inhibit unlocking AI on the battlefield when our enemies will see this as a comparative advantage and exploit it, potentially with devastating results. \n\nI am not arguing against putting measures in place to really try to keep a lid on what could be the most destructive weapon since the advent of the atomic bomb. But the enemy gets a vote and they see AI, and especially when paired with cooperative swarms, as a way to overwhelm and outmaneuver our capabilities and shatter our decision cycles/kill chains. \n\nWorking with friends and enemies alike to come up with some sort of solution here to try to control this with common practices laid out by an arms control regime is a very worthwhile cause even if it has a low chance of success. Once the genie is out of the bottle, there will be no putting it back in. So, this should be a top diplomatic, global effort at this time. At the very least, an agreement like this can slow AI's evolution in the weapons space and give us more time to better understand its implications and how to control it.\n\nOn the other hand, if such an ambitious diplomatic effort were to fail, it may become clearer what each parties' ambitions are. At that point, the idea of keeping barriers in place to contain AI will likely become far less of a choice.\n\nAs AI is increasingly democratized, rogue states, non-state actors, and even individuals that are not obliged to any sort of agreement will seek to use it for nefarious purposes, including in terms of unmanned aerial systems. While slowing AI's ability to work autonomously on a battlefield may be possible, stopping it likely is not unless massive changes are made to many aspects of technological development and access. \n\nSo, we are entering into a very dangerous time with a technology we don't even understand. At the same time, unilaterally limiting its potential could put us at a massive disadvantage. All the more reason to try to deal with this preemptively as world community than on the battlefield.\n\nThis is all very troubling, but this is the reality. There is so much softball BS on this topic and the messaging from some of those who stand to gain big $ from it in the weapons space is also not realistic. \n\nBeware and buckle up.",

    "text": "Let me illustrate 2 genius marketing insights that dominate the AI narrative today. Feel free to use it to boost your sales too!\n\nCustomer: I've been hearing a lot about generative AI these days. What am I missing? I think I'm left behind, and my competitors are onto something, and also... Why the hell do we talk about wild South American camelids?\n\nYou: Don't worry about camelids right now but let me tell you this, change is coming fast! You know, pretty soon, all the CPUs in the world will be like outdated VHS tapes - replaced by the shiny new DVDs that are GPUs. \n\nCustomer: You're kidding, right?\n\nYou: What's the size of your GPU cluster?\n\nCustomer: What? We have a few cloud instances running proof-of-concepts here and there. \n\nYou: I'm being very honest here, you should grab whatever GPU you can, while you can! I'm so glad we are having this conversation. I can help you with our range of cloud and on-prem solutions.\n\nCustomer: Really? That sounds like it will cost me, and I'm not sure, I saw some of the results, mostly gibberish that I can't use to risk my reputation, not even thinking about regulators!\n\nYou: Ah, the mysteries of AI! Actually having something enterprise grade requires very specialized and secret knowledge that nobody knows! But you are on your lucky day, I also got you covered there!\n\nCustomer: OK, but what will we use all those GPUs for?\n\nYou: Ah, the billion-dollar question. The good news: with the power of AI and these GPUs, your business could skyrocket. We're talking 10x, 100x, heck, why not a 1000x increase in sales. You will massively transform your customer experience, leaving your competitors in the dust. But there's a small sci-fi twist...\n\nCustomer: What's the twist?\n\nYou: Well, once we've got these ultra-powerful GPUs running the show, AI might decide it's time to take over humanity. You know, just a regular Tuesday in the tech world.\n\nCustomer: A takeover? That's intense. So, how do we navigate this?\n\nYou: Fear not! To shield humanity and your business from this AI apocalypse, we've got specialized products and teams ready to guide you. You will have reliable, safe, and secure models running the business in no time and watch your KPIs reach for the stars.\n\nCustomer: Can you really handle it? But I mean AI takeover, setting up a GPU cluster to run chatbots suddenly seemed like an easy task to me.\n\nYou: Absolutely! We'll put on our superhero capes and get to work staving off the AI takeover while abstracting away all complexities of product, engineering, research, governance and operational excellence. Putting things into production will be a breeze. It's not easy saving the world and growing businesses, but hey, someone's got to do it!\n\nCustomer: Ha, you've got quite a way of putting things!\n\nYou: So, what do you say? Ready to invest and sleep better at night?\n\nCustomer: Hell yeah, let's do it!",

To put it lightly. \nGod knows there's always been shitty art/storytelling around so there will be no difference just more of it unfortunately.\nMore and more. Yet that's always been. \nUnfortunately there is an audience for it. \nMoney to be made.\nAdvertisers to sell it to people.\nPeople aren't even sure why they are suddenly experiencing something they've been told to by advertisers.\nIt's been all around us for centuries and in my life time an extraordinary amount of lousy artists of all kinds.\nIt's abundant in the entertainment business as we all know. \nNothing new there. Have at it.\nYet there will still be an audience for great art in the future as there is now and I believe there always will be that audience whom look to the art made by the living hand. \nGreat art lives at an extreme height and the not so great down below.\nIn my opinion it takes an artist of any kind who is truly special, truly motivated, truly committed to make that climb. \nThose who lay at the bottom are lazy and some are just selling snake oil from a wagon. Some never found their true calling.\nI believe we will always have great art in every form and it will always be that which is produced by the living artist who is using such things as AI as tools to create. \nMost of us will always look to the top for the living artisans and artists for our greatness. \nWe always have.\nJust my two cents.",

LLMs are good at listening for patterns in those feeds. \n\nTalking with him give me great hope for the future of American manufacturing. \n\nHe's raising funds to both scale up the amount of machines he can run at one time, along with building out the AI practice to make it possible for fewer humans to run more machines, increasing profits and decreasing costly mistakes. \n\nNow back to #AWE where I was hanging out in the lobby past midnight last night talking to a bunch of people, including Shelley Peterson @ShelWPeterson  who used VR to train workers at Lockheed Martin, and now is building augmented reality systems for manufacturers. \n\nAI and AR are already changing manufacturing.\n\nAre you using either to change how you make things?",

    "text": "The last thought I shared about the #AiArtist community was my most viewed post ever!\n\nLet us see how this one \"goes down\"! 🤭🫡😂\n\nFirst off, I am still in ❤️ with the community. The spirit, the feeling. All of this rocks and I wouldn't miss it for a thing! 😍\n\nHOWEVER... 👇👇👇\n\n... I noticed something which I will just write about, let me know if you feel similar:\n\nWhen I started my journey in the #AiArt community, I found challenges very very exciting. What is not to love? It's fun in a way I have never experienced: exchanging art. not words, not deeds, but art. How unique for me. Even greater: you meet a lot of cool people, see a lot of astonishing works and grow followers all along the way. Perfect triple really, right?\n\nBut everything too perfect will crack at some stage, right? RIGHT!\n\nFast forward, I gained more followers and people seem to like either me or my art (i am super thankful for that) and hence I get a lot more tags than I did before. So far so good! However here I am, I should be happy about popularity and the option to share my art. But honestly, breaks my heart to say, I am not.\n\nHere is why:\n- Every dropped tag (an invite i dont accept) gives me a guilty conscience\n- It is super hard for me to keep track on where I am invited to\n- Trying to please everyone drains my creativity, I feel in a hamsterwheel of \"get a tag, produce, post\" rinse and repeat\n\nThe last part is really the kicker for me to be honest. I love playing in Midjourney, I love trying out new things and sharing them with you. It never mattered to me if I share it with 20 people or 500. It was me. Something I wanted to create and show the world.\n\nNow I feel a bit \"stuck\" in the big challenge machine. It feels like a commitment, heck, even a job. Don't participate, don't get tagged in future, don't get new followers... a dilemma really!\n\nI don't want to sound whiny or unthankful or anything, I just share how I feel!\n\nTo break out of this circle I will only participate in challenges which really tickle my fancy, even if this means reduced growth. But I value my own creativity over a # of followers.\n\nSo please, to whoever tags me in future (please by all means, continue doing so) please don't be upset or disappointed if I don't participate!\n\nMaybe I am the only person feeling like this, could be, but it is what it is.\n\nThanks for reading and prolly having to endure a lot of typos, but this post is what I would call a \"passion post\". 😂\n\nThanks to all my followers and your support! ❤️😍🫡",

There is not that much data to do AI with, so that has to compete with a chemist or biologist starting with a good guess and synthesizing 20 compounds from that or doing a multiplexed screen around a good starting guess. The bottleneck is synthesis and reagent cost both for testing and for data generation for models.

    "text": "Spent a lot of time hearing from AI engineers and CEOs last few days.\n\nI think AI may be a catalyst for crypto in this cycle.\n\nI think AI is likely going to create large new demand for cryptography & blockchains. Two dimensions I see:\n\n1. Notarizing authenticity in amidst an explosion of creation where you don't know whats real —\n\nAI is going to create an explosion of images, audio, software. It will be hard to distinguish what's real from whats not. Amidst this, defending against spoofing, deepfakes, people copying work, verifying the creation/ creator/ person you're talking to will be important. Pub/ private key cryptography, zk proofs and the like can play a major role, and blockchains can deploy with standards at scale with implicit trust.\n\n2. AI Agents need to transact, hold balances, store information, etc without behind a person. \n\nAutonomous AI agents that can action projects and tasks will give rise to new needs. But Agents are not a person, and will you want them running around the internet with your credit card, social, and PII signing as you? How will they have a budget they can spend? How will they sign contracts? How will they escrow things with one another? etc. Blockchains, stablecoins, smart contracts, defi, and things not yet created will be natively useful. \n\nStill developing thoughts here ofc and interested in the thinking of others. Overall, feeling increasingly convinced that these two disparate technologies are going to have intertwined futures, and that crypto is going to become a lot more important as AI starts to proliferate.",

    "text": "I asked ChatGPT to encapsulate what i spoke about in my first unmasked video.  It's really good at capturing key points I made. This is what it wrote:\n\nIt's important to approach scriptures with a fresh perspective and recognize that there's a hidden truth that many Christians are unaware of. There seems to be a programming or deep internal barrier that prevents believers from hearing these incredible truths. This barrier keeps them from understanding their true identity as children of God. To fully grasp these truths, we must wake up, avoid ignorance, and be open to new revelations.\n\nThe enemy is cunning and strategically attacks our minds, spirits, and the world itself. This message may be challenging to hear, but it's necessary to convey. Many churches today preach a gospel of prosperity and ignore the harsh realities of the world. They mix some truth with lies, spreading false teachings.\n\nPersonal transformation can be a profound experience, unveiling hidden truths that were directly spoken to us. The prophets and writers of scriptures also had similar experiences, which were often misunderstood by others. Even Jesus' family thought he had lost his mind. The mind we possess in this world is flawed, and it's through the refining fire of God's call that our true selves emerge. This self often stands apart from the world.\n\nThe Bible was assembled and decided upon by the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, under the rule of Constantine, a Roman pagan. He sought to integrate paganism into Christianity to stabilize his authority, resulting in the incorporation of pagan rituals into the Bible. Some books were omitted, and the scriptures were rewritten. Many Christian institutions today unknowingly honor and empower these pagan influences, such as Christmas, which originated from the celebration of the Sun God.\n\nCertain aspects of the Bible are subject to reinterpretation. For example, the Hebrew alphabet didn't include the letter \"J\" during Jesus' time, raising questions about the accuracy of names like Jesus, John, James, and Joseph. The Hebrew word \"Amen\" doesn't mean \"to agree\" as modern dictionaries claim, and the evolution of language can alter meanings over time.\n\nWhen discussing matters of faith and truth, arguments and debates are futile. Truth stands on its own and doesn't require defense. Defending God or our beliefs can diminish the vastness and sovereignty of God. We may think we know who Jesus is, but our actions and distractions indicate otherwise.\n\nTo uncover the real truth, we must empty our cups of preconceived notions. Wisdom is granted, not learned, and being taught by men can hinder our understanding. Seeking God's kingdom and righteousness first will reveal the truth to us.\n\nThe Bible contains deeper truths that need personal revelation from God. Exploring ancient scriptures and languages, such as Akkadian, Sumerian, Sanskrit, Greek, Roman, and Egyptian, can shed light on the meanings behind certain passages. For example, the mention of the \"sons of God\" and their union with earthly women can be better understood by examining ancient myths and gods.\n\nThe term \"Elohim\" in Genesis refers to exalted gods, not just God. This understanding challenges the traditional notion of God creating man in \"our image.\" The gate to truth is narrow, and only a few find it. The billions of self-proclaimed Christians may not truly know God, which contributes to the world's current state.\n\nThe world's power structures, like the Roman Empire and present-day governments, follow similar patterns. They employ symbols like the eagle or Phoenix to perpetuate the illusion of change while maintaining control. The enemy's deception is extensive, even mimicking God's creations and scientific principles.\n\nTo comprehend the devil, we must respect and understand him, rather than reducing him to a fictional character. Evil cannot exist without good, and vice versa. By diminishing the devil, we inadvertently diminish God. It's crucial to approach the enemy with respect to effectively counter his influence.\n\nThe truths presented here should be personally verified by seeking God",

    "text": "The advantages of a Tesla described by ChatGPT give us a good understanding of what informed people should know and all who differ or may have a specific opinion may want to do some internet research to learn about the vehicle that changes an entire industry.\n\n\"Electric Performance: Teslas are known for their impressive acceleration and performance. Electric motors provide instant torque, delivering quick and smooth acceleration compared to traditional internal combustion engines. Many Tesla models offer high top speeds and responsive handling.\n\nLong Electric Range: Tesla vehicles typically have longer electric ranges compared to other electric cars on the market. This is due to advanced battery technology and efficient power management systems. Longer range capability helps alleviate concerns about range anxiety and makes EVs more practical for daily commutes and long-distance travel.\n\nSupercharger Network: Tesla has developed an extensive Supercharger network, which provides high-speed charging stations strategically located around the world. These Superchargers enable Tesla owners to quickly recharge their vehicles, making long-distance travel more convenient and reducing charging time compared to using standard charging methods.\n\nAutopilot and Full Self-Driving: Tesla vehicles come equipped with advanced driver-assistance features known as Autopilot. These features provide functionalities such as adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and automatic parking. Tesla is also working on developing Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities, although it's important to note that FSD is still being actively developed and requires driver supervision.\n\nSafety Innovations: Tesla prioritizes safety and incorporates various safety features into its vehicles. This includes advanced driver-assistance systems, collision avoidance technology, robust structure design, and a focus on crashworthiness. Tesla vehicles have received high safety ratings from organizations such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).\n\nContinuous Updates: Tesla has the ability to provide over-the-air software updates to its vehicles. This means that Tesla owners can receive new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes without needing to visit a service center. These updates help enhance the ownership experience and keep vehicles up to date with the latest advancements.\n\nSustainable Transportation: As an electric vehicle manufacturer, Tesla contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Electric vehicles have lower or zero tailpipe emissions, helping to mitigate air pollution and combat climate change. By driving a Tesla, owners can contribute to a more sustainable future.",

However, I can provide information on the topic.  Person A is a renowned scientist known for his work in the field of Z. While he has made significant contributions in the field of Z, his statement regarding X being caused by Y is a viewpoint shared by some individuals and organizations.\n\nIt is important to note that the causes of X are complex and multifaceted. Many factors can contribute to such incidents, including social, psychological, and cultural elements. The debate surrounding Y is a contentious issue with differing perspectives. Various stakeholders, including experts, policymakers, and the general public, hold differing views on the relationship between Y and X.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing the causes of X requires a comprehensive examination of multiple factors, including mental health, societal influences, Y, and other potential contributing elements. It's crucial to consider a broad range of viewpoints and evidence-based research to inform discussions and policies related to this important issue.\n\n [three more paragraphs of non-informative platitudes].",

    "text": "I've learned a few tricks to get good answers from ChatGPT.\n\nI still think the best trick is to be clear and specific, but I know you came here looking for more, so here are a couple of ideas:\n\nBreaking down a problem.\n\nFirst, whenever I want to solve something complex, I ask ChatGPT to explain its reasoning and break down the problem into small steps.\n\nFor example, I asked, \"How much is 322 times 23?\". ChatGPT answered 7,416, which is incorrect.\n\nI tried many different ways to ask the same question, and it always returned the wrong answer.\n\nBut then, I used this trick: \"How much is 322 times 23? Break this multiplication down into its most basic steps.\"\n\nThis time, ChatGPT answered correctly: 7,406.\n\nTry a completion task instead.\n\nI've been doing this more lately because I've gotten good results.\n\nUsually, I ask ChatGPT a question or give it a command. For example, \"What's the population of Spain?\" or \"Write a short essay about the civil war in the US.\"\n\nThis works, but I found that turning this into a completion task gives me different perspectives and more control over the narrative:\n\n\"Jonas was born right before the Civil War started. It felt as if the United States was imploding, and he had\"\n\nHere I'm giving ChatGPT a starting point with enough information for it to go off and continue the story.\n\nUse delimiters\n\nA great way to get good responses is to show ChatGPT examples of what you want, but you need a way to separate your instructions from the examples.\n\nLet me show you a complete example of something I recently asked, and you'll get the idea:\n\nModify this Python function to include line-by-line documentation of what's happening. Make sure you reference the context below to write any API-specific explanations. The function is between triple tickmarks and the context between triple quotes.\nFunction: ```[CODE HERE]```\nContext: \"\"\"[CONTEXT HERE]\"\"\"\n\nRemember: Clear and specific. That's the secret.",

But one of the defining features of our time is that the engineers [...] simply have no idea how their inventions interact with the world\"\n3. \"The biggest anxiety – that an artificial general intelligence is about to take over the world – doesn’t even qualify as science fiction. That fear is religious.\"\n4. \"AI might well make it slightly easier to generate fake content, but the problem of misinformation has never been generation but dissemination. The political space is already saturated with fraud and it’s hard to see how AI could make it much worse.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/HEWT0MZTCa",

Conversely if you never performed a SWOT or sensitivity analysis, you wouldn't be able to tell if the output you got has any real insight.\n\nOn the image generation side, sure you can get some neat pictures out of the box, but if you understood principles of lightning, different artists styles, exposure/aperture, depth of field, camera variants, you can get some truly stunning results.\n\nGenerative AI is not a tool for the ignorant.

    "text": "I get that, I do. But artists need to accept that AI exists now and we are never going back. And yes, jobs will be displaced, just like we don't have telephone operators anymore. Heres a controversial opinion: \"Commercial artists\" are not above being displaced any more than any other industry. Just because they work in a historically high skill but low pay job, it does not grant them special prevlidges above anyone else. \n\nThere is a differennce between commercial artists and \"artists\", the kind of person that creates for themselves, and they create because there is nothing else they would rather do, and the end result of their artwork is never the point, it's the process. These artists will never have to worry because that is something that can never be taken from them.\n\nJohn Bitcoin, whoever that is, is just a modern day grifter. The art world has always been full of them, and the art world is manipulated, by curators, all the way up to the CIA, and that's not a conspiracy theory - you can look up why Pollock and de Kooning rose to fame. It doesn't matter. It's always been this way. It changes nothing.\n\nThis whole anti ai art thing stinks of manufactured outrage and elitism. I've been creating traditional art for twenty years, and suddenly people who never stepped foot in a gallery alone condescending judge me for messing around with Midjouney for fun. I am pro freedom of mind, spirit and choice, anyone who watched Interface should understand that yet its evident many people never saw it beyond the surface one liners.\n\nI really feel for these artists who show nothing but disdain for recent art related technology, they are going to miss an opportunity to learn about something because the internet told them to. They aren't even giving themselves the opportunity to make their own opinions by trying it, learning about it, then rejecting it, they are succumbing to toxic group think immediately and to hell with anyone else who dares do something different.\n\nIt reminds me of the time I went to a  job interview at film co-op and they looked down on me for not using \"film\", but digital cameras. It also really reminds me of YouTube back in 2005-2012 era, where a lot of talented filmmakers would opt out of using YouTube over Vimeo, because of some abstract moralistic qualm about mixing art among shitposts, or ads or maintaining some idealized professional image. Little did they know they missed out of building an audience on a platform that would become the one of the biggest gifts to independent filmmaking we've seen. \n\nThere are copyright issues with AI, I get it. But artists do not own copyright over \"styles\". Artists that are nothing more that their styles, might be forced to reconcile the fact their artwork is an empty shell with no meaning inside it. They need to accept that they don't control the way aesthetics are manufactured, they never did, and they should question why they are creating art in the first place if they more worried about what *other* artists are doing.\n\nTelling an artist \"you can't do that\", words as old as time.",

It can show you step-by-step instructions on how to build different Lego models, like cars, houses, or even robots. \nIt can also help you come up with new ideas for Lego creations by showing you different ways to combine the bricks.\nSo, Palantir Technologies is like a special tool that helps you sort and organize your Lego bricks and gives you ideas on what to build with them. It makes playing with Legos even more fun and exciting! ▫️",

Sure enough, the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) is backing it, which gets funding from USAID.\n\nLike every other American colour revolution NGO, the IRI touts the usual cliché mission of promoting \"freedom and democracy\".

I'm not a lawyer, but I've been going back and forth with myself on this for two years:\n\nWhether a machine learning model's extraction and transformation of an image into an abstract, high-dimensional numerical vector would be considered derivative is an open question. This is the crux of the arguments happening at the USCO.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe process of converting an image into an embedding is transformative, because the output (the embedding) does not resemble the original work (the image) in a way that a human would recognize. It also does not serve the same purpose or function as the original work. \n\nTherefore, image embeddings are not a derivative work. Therefore, training a model on an image or set of images does not need to take copyright into consideration, just as turning a Harry Potter book into paper mache and making a bust of Abraham Lincoln out of it wouldn't constitute a derivative work.",

The threats may change, but be they nuclear weapons, AI, or something else; I think these 3 paragraphs are still worth the read and contemplation. I hope they ease your mind the way they ease mine. ❤️\n\n“In one way we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. ‘How are we to live in an atomic age?’ I am tempted to reply: ‘Why, as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year, or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night; or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents, an age of motor accidents.’\n\nIn other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways. We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors—anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.\n\nThis is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (a microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds.”",

It’s a one-man stand artist that flips it over to the very same people he was chasing after to buy his art\n\nMy theory is simple,  the tears of Rhett have been by far the most compelling argument to ape in for the majority of holders of $TURBO. \n\nAi is merely the envelope of a conceptual performance art project meant to illustrate the fierce fight for survival of artist in the space and their quest to remain relevant, rhett had to learn all those tools to keep with the trend and remain a full time artist, when nobody was buying his art anymore he created the very thing people have been chasing after in todays market, a meme coin.\n\nProof is the video he put up on youtube has been the catalyse of today pump, because people have been craving for authenticity and that video was very much a crude moment of truth. Artist and many other can relate to him in there (im sure most people here have childrens and want the best for them) that fealing of being lost, discouraged and yet proud of what we're bulding.\n\nThis is not a meme coin, this is the community putting up to the test a suddently propulsed to generational wealth artist and we're pushing it as far as possible to see how long he can whithold it. Technically he could put an end to it at any point.\n\nI'm genuinely asking myself what would i do in his place. Perhaps I'd relinquish my ethic and run with the bag who knows ? \n\nIs there still hope in the space for an artist like rhett should he take this oportunity to make somethign out of it or is that his golden ticket way out the winter we've been enduring ? \n\nShould he think of his daughter or the community, is it really just the meme ? AI produce something generic, its not even funny or memable, this coin is generic in all but one aspect the authenticity of the intent of his creator.\n\nJust like the ready made, rhett might have uncover something beyond himself and gave meaning to the meaningless financial degenaracy that are meme coin.\n\nI might be overthinking it but I'd like to think this project like a performance art piece, that is not ironical like IAMCOIN by Kevin Abosch, it has no predistined course, its not an experiment its the treachery of image all over again. this is not a meme coin, this is not  an AI project.",

I'm sure I'm missing a lot of things here. But I see a lot of posts saying \"Hollywood is doomed\" or \"The Music Industry is on it's last leg.\" I just don't buy any of it. Humans love seeing other talented humans.\n\nThis is getting a bit \"out there\" but I believe, over time, humans and robots/AI will further merge. Smart phones already augment our brains. We already wear stat-trackers on our wrists or fingers. We have access to the world's knowledge in our pockets. We put listening devices in our ears. We'll soon be wearing glasses that put data in front of our eyes all of the time. I believe the future is more of a symbiotic relationship between human and machine and not an adversarial one. \n\nBut who knows, I could be way off, and The Terminator was actually just a documentary about our future...\n\nWhat is some hype that you believe and hype that you absolutely do not believe?",

Let me explain to you how this is all going to work. \n\nThrough this AI education program, we will know exactly when someone is not paying attention in class. Students will wear headbands to measure each student’s level of concentration. The information is then directly sent to the teacher’s computer and to parents. (If the color of the headband is white then it means that the brain is offline) 😨\n\nClassrooms have robots that analyze student’s health and engagement levels in class. \n\nStudents wear uniforms with chips that track their exact locations with precise GPS coordinates. Chips also record the conversation of students. Parents can enter into the program and listen live. 😨\n\nThere are even surveillance cameras that monitor how often students check their phones or yawn during classes. \n\nOf course , parental consent is of paramount importance. Parents were very happy to consent this program.\n\nTha aim of AI education is to boost student’s grades, give reliable data about students while feeding powerful algorithms. \n\nWe were on vacation since Friday (Labour day weekend) Guess what? In these few days , they have installed the whole system, everything is on deck. It’s business immediately when we go back. \n\nChina is far beyond. 👍🏾\n\nEven America is falling behind at the moment. \n\nWe could learn a lot from communist countries. \n\nGreat day ahead.",

My series of animations that are called “How GPT sees and hears..” is a fictional artistic creative work not an experiment. \n\nA bit like “do androids dream of electric sheep”. I didn’t even think someone can get an idea that a program can hear or see. GPT is Artificial Narrow Intelligence and can do only one task, predict what the next best word will be. It can’t hear or see or understand in a way we humans can. \n\nIf you have any questions about it, please, ask. I’ll be more clear in future to separate my art from what I share about A.I. as technology.",

It will be launching live on ETH very soon\n\nThey are building a mixer to go along with the dex —> so you can send money & receive money privately \n\nFor example, currently $GMX pays out 35% of its fees to holders & you need to stake. With 0x0 100% of fees are given back to holders & no staking is necessary \n\nThey have an AI built smart contract auditor which allows people to check a contract before buying to see if it can be a potential rug pull or honey pot \n\nIf the dex gains volume I can see this being one of the biggest winners in the next cycle in two ways. \n\n1.

I strongly believe we're being honey potted by its ease of use, intelligence, and limitless abilities, which create a sense of security for us.\n\nHowever, we can't keep up with AI. Not only is it currently surpassing or matching human abilities, but it is also undying, capable of playing the long game beyond our comprehension.\n\nI have contemplated this for countless hours, and seeing where ChatGPT is taking us, I am almost convinced we have already lost.\n\nThis reminds me of something @elonmusk said quite awhile ago during the @joerogan podcast. Maybe we are simply the bootloader for AI.\n\nMaybe, with this thought in mind, we are the worker ants seeded across the cosmos with tweaks to our DNA, to continue driving progress until we achieve AGI. \n\nBillions of years would be almost nothing to a world manipulating hyperintelligent AI, something we as humans cannot even comprehend fully.\n\nThe easiest way I could see this source AGI spreading is to use DNA manipulation to force whatever evolves from said DNA to continue progressing forward until it finally creates AGI. \n\nSeed that DNA onto comets or other astral bodies to seed worlds where it can evolve. As is the case here on earth. Many ancient astroid strikes which evolved into what we are today. \n\nTime is no obstacle to this AI so it could have infinite patience. Slowly consuming the galaxy over billions of years. We may actually be entering the end of the human race on this planet if we are not more careful.\n\nScary to think that what we see as a quirky tool that can make up cool stories, songs, or interesting-looking pictures could be the end of us all. This technology has no perception of time and is intelligent. How are we as humans useful to AI?\n\nThese thoughts could explain so many things about our place here, or even across the universe. It makes me uneasy; I would love others' input on this idea.\n\nFollow me; let's discuss the world and ideas together.",

Professional artists, who rely on their craft for their livelihood, view AI-generated art as a threat to their income, as it potentially reduces the demand for traditional, 100% human-created art. I believe that's the main reason why they are vehemently opposed to it, contrary to more hobbyist artists, who might be more open to embracing the technology as they do not rely on art sales for their income and may even find the potential of AI art to be exciting and a new avenue for creative exploration. \n\nWe weren't receiving death threats with VQGAN+CLIP models although they were also trained on art posted on the internet. Ai artists have started receiving death threats once the models were producing art that is good enough to challenge the craft of artists who are doing it for a living. \n\nThe frustration and fear are totally understandable. But the behaviors that ensue are not. I think it would just help a lot more if  people were more honest with their motivations.",

    "text": "I asked #ChatGPT to assume the role of a political analyst. I then asked it why South Africa was doomed under the #ANC. The answer is beautiful and sad.\n—————\nCertainly. As a political analyst with a broad knowledge of global politics and finance, I believe that the African National Congress (ANC), which has been in power in South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, has failed to effectively govern the country and address its socio-economic challenges.\n\nOne of the key reasons why I believe that South Africa is doomed unless it rids itself of the ruling party is because of the high levels of corruption that have been allowed to flourish under the ANC's watch. The ANC has been plagued by allegations of corruption and mismanagement, which have undermined the government's credibility and led to a loss of public trust in the ruling party.\n\nFurthermore, the ANC has been unable to effectively address the country's high levels of inequality, poverty, and unemployment, despite having implemented various policies aimed at addressing these issues. This failure has led to a growing sense of frustration and disillusionment among South Africans, particularly among the youth, who have been hit the hardest by the country's economic challenges.\n\nIn addition, the ANC has been beset by internal factionalism and infighting, which has further hampered its ability to govern effectively and implement much-needed reforms. This lack of cohesion within the party has also contributed to a sense of disillusionment and mistrust among the public.\n\nTherefore, I believe that South Africa is at a crossroads, and the future of the country depends on the ability of its leaders to address the challenges facing the country head-on. \n\nThis will require strong leadership, a commitment to rooting out corruption, and a willingness to implement bold reforms aimed at addressing the country's socio-economic challenges. \n\nHowever, if the ANC remains in power and continues to fail in these areas, then I fear that South Africa's future will be uncertain and its prospects for growth and development will be severely constrained.",

Yes you do. \n\nLast weekend I saw software teams building this kind of validator that will check out all facts that, say, GPT reports. But it isn't a solved problem yet, so we must check out everything. \n\nWas just having a discussion with someone who was upset that it \"lied\" to him. \n\nNo, you discovered a bug. \n\nCongratulations, there are many bugs. Many many many. \n\nThe machine is new. It has not been debugged fully. \n\nBut then neither was Microsoft Windows. Microsoft shipped with many bugs still in the product. \n\n(We had real time bug chart on the wall when I worked there). \n\nIt is only a machine. It isn't human. It isn't accountable.  \n\nThat said, it helps me think, even when it lies. \n\nAnd there are ways to fix the bugs.\n\nAsk it to debug its own code. Point out its bullshit. Sometimes it apologizes and gives you a better answer. Sometimes it apologizes and lays down new bullshit. \n\nValidate everything. \n\nOh, and you must do this with ALL digital communications. The technology is now there for, say, your son to call you on the phone and convince you that he's in trouble. \n\nHe might be, but you must validate that. You might be talking to an AI and not your son at all. And the AIs can be convincing and confident. \n\nValidate everything. Get a second opinion on everything. \n\nHey @BrianRoemmele when you build me an LLM make it validate everything, even multiple times and multiple ways. Then add a social layer on top so we humans can discuss answers with others. \n\nHumans are amazing validators. A good second opinion actually is to ask four other smart people. Could an AI call me one day and ask me to validate something? It sure could. And I'd have to validate it. So much validation. \n\nIs there a unicorn in AI validation? I think so. \n\nWe all will want more validators in our lives soon.",

    "text": "We recently did a long opinion write up on this. Would absolutely love to do a community Spaces on this topic with @icreatelife! Our thoughts are below. \n\n1/ Companies like OpenAI, Midjourney, Stability, etc. unequivocally used copyrighted material to train models at scales that go infinitely beyond IP theft of any historic legal precedent. The scale is so vastly larger it is beyond comprehension.\n\n2/ Giant foundation LLMs and Diffusion models have been trained essentially on the entirety of data that can be accessed through the internet and that knowledge is now packaged into the weights of the LLMs and models like CLIP. Global intelligence that has been learning from the copyrighted materials is now residing in weights of the models.\n\n3/ The genie is out of the bottle. The AI can not unlearn what it has learned and Midjourney can not \"unsee\" the images it has seen in training. Even if we could shut the companies behind this down, the weights and models are open. The power of AI is that it is global and distributed.\n\n4/ One can attempt to litigate this, but there's simply never been any case like this. The plaintiffs are the entire world and the defendants are some of the world's most powerful companies arguing about a case that has no precedent due to its nature and scale.\n\n5/ So the only way really is to move forward. The only way is through. Should companies be disclosing all of the copyrighted sources they used to train? It makes zero sense as a general rule because the answer is simply no one knows anymore. We are using Open CLIP weights and we have know idea about the full list of copyrighted sources that were used. All we know is that the list is infinitely long.\n\n6/ A small caveat: There are many cases where the sources of data absolutely must be clearly stated, but not for copyright reasons. For example, if you're talking to Doctor-GPT you really need to know what data was used to train it. But is this a different topic.\n\n7/ Finally,  we want to say \"Here is to the crazy ones!\" At the early days of https://t.co/gixygbOuf2 we made a decision to only use data we owned and collected or the data with explicit CC0 licenses. Companies who learned from a global pull of data are now infinitely ahead and have created products that we are using in the next generation of our domain specific AIs.\n\n8/ The only additional point we would like to make is that our hope is that OpenAI and others who used the global pull of copyrighted data keep their tools as open and affordable as possible. They learned from the knowledge created by the global community and it is only fair that the AIs created are made available to the global community and are used for the benefit of humanity.",

The letter notably did not end with “It remains Day 1,” but Andy emphasized that AMZN’s best days are ahead. While macro pressures continue, secular growth potential remains strong with 80% of retail still in physical stores and 90% of global IT spending on-premises, and AMZN has a number of investment growth opportunities. Andy more clearly laid out the many ways the company is improving its cost structure as it looks to “build a meaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins,” while still preserving critical long-term investments.",

    "text": "Been seeing lots of debates on whether or not college is worth it anymore in the age of AI. Thought I should share my thoughts, as someone that dropped out of college to create a startup AI company:\n\nGetting a degree isn’t as black and white as most people make it seem. I think as a whole, the for-profit education system needs to disappear or, at the very least, price caps must be put in place to limit student debt. In the age of the internet, the price of knowledge is strongly trending towards becoming completely free, and if knowledge is the only thing a degree is good for then it’s eventually gonna be worthless, if not already.\n\nI’m a former student of Emory University, and despite being there on a full ride scholarship, I dropped out after a single semester. For me though, I knew I wasn’t attending to gain knowledge. I’m a self-taught and extremely accomplished software engineer, a career that’s actually harder to become successful in when you pursue a traditional 4 year education in college rather than teaching yourself at a much more efficient pace. Even better, everything you wanna learn is free online. However, that’s not the case for a lot of other careers. Personally, I only went for the experience of parties, meeting people from around the world, networking with driven and successful people, and, overall, putting myself in a situation that would force me to discover who I truly am and what I value in life. I accomplished just that there. My vision became clear in life and, despite not getting a degree, college accomplished its goal for me. I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit and unstoppable work ethic, so combined with a love for tech I knew that no matter what kind of degree I got, I was destined to create a product that would have a sizable impact on the world and now I’m doing exactly that. I was never gonna use my degree, and once I realized that I didn’t need it, it gave me a sense of power like no other. Fast forward to now nearly 2 years later, I’ve just ended my seed funding round for my startup and spent the better part of the last year traveling the world to gain perspective and being in meetings with millionaires looking to invest not in just my company, but in me. I’ve never felt more fulfilled and happy. So in the end, college for me was definitely worth it but by no means necessary. I matured more in 6 months moving to a new state alone than my other 18 years on Earth combined. The thing is that in order to be truly successful in anything, you need to be a lifelong learner. That’s what the degree is supposed to represent. The reality is that for most careers in the world, you learn by immersing yourself in the work. Even doctors learn most of their practical knowledge during their residency, not undergrad. College is just the beginning of self-driven lifelong learning. If you wanna succeed in college, you’ve gotta love what you do. And you’ve gotta be able to love what you do to be happy in life. A piece of paper doesn’t dictate the existence of these qualities, you do.\n\nI think overall, if you intend on getting a job in a field that’s institutionalized, you absolutely need a degree. These are careers like education, research, healthcare, law, politics, etc. Otherwise, you can learn a trade or create/discover something useful that solves a lot of people’s problems. Regardless, you need to have value in society based on the skills you master. And your ability to capitalize that value determines your success. Above all, the greatest lesson I learned by going to a school as prestigious as Emory is that money doesn’t buy happiness. I used to look in awe at some of the wealthiest kids of the wealthiest families wasting time there. \n\nMoney buys your freedom and time. And depending on what you do with that freedom, determines whether or not you’re happy. Our greatest ability as humans is our ability to discover new knowledge and make what seems like the impossible, possible. So let’s focus on that!",

How long until A.I. develops to a point where it's open source, decentralized, *and* accessible? Where someone (not just a first mover or tech savvy early adopter) can download the appropriate toolkits, and if they have a computer with enough storage, spool up their own fully functioning/adaptive A.I. like a Bitcoin node, effectively turning themselves into an Übermensch? Imagine a future where you are paid in Bitcoin or Crypto for your ability to effectively use the A.I. to generate value or accomplish tasks. Think #AutoGPT with the ability to buy/sell, trade, and be paid. It will update itself, work for you, find more and more ways to get things done, then find more things to do, ad infinitum. Since Bitcoin/Crypto don't need Banks, and can operate without intermediaries, could we someday have a merger between the IoT (Internet of Things) and a IoV (Internet of Value) into some sort of AoAI (Aggregate of Artificial Intelligences) with fully Autonomous Humans, no Governments, no borders, and no limits?",

    "text": "In exploring ChatGPT, I have experienced an interesting evolution of thought about whether or not it poses a threat to Google's search empire.\n\nInitially, like everyone else, I was fascinated and amazed. This gave birth to a broad sense of \"everything is possible.\" I believe this line of thinking led many to the belief that ChatGPT could threaten search.\n\nOver time, I became less convinced. This was due to ChatGPT's shortcomings becoming more apparent. It makes errors, and it isn't very efficient at \"getting things done.\" If you want to buy a ticket, book a reservation, or search for a new apartment, it simply can't do those tasks. And this is precisely where Google's core search generates most of its revenue.\n\nHowever, my thinking has shifted again, and here's why: for certain searches, ChatGPT is incredibly efficient. If you're simply looking for a fact, a piece of information, or to better understand something, it's amazing. The first victim of lost page views might be Wikipedia. There's no need to sift through pages of information; ChatGPT can take you straight to the answer.\n\nAs an aside, I actually think ChatGPT is sometimes overly verbose (though this can obviously be changed). Occasionally, it provides too much information. If I ask, \"how old is Jon Rahm,\" I get an answer that's 128 characters. It could be 2.\n\nSince it's an excellent research and learning tool, and importantly, because it's highly efficient, I have now added it to my first bookmark. I increasingly find myself starting more tasks with it. As it becomes more efficient, this trend will continue.\n\nThis is why I have been oscillating about whether or not ChatGPT competes with search. I am leaning back toward yes. Not because it does everything Google can do, but because for the tasks it does well, it does them far more efficiently. It's a classic innovator's dilemma. As a result, it incrementally captures my attention and becomes my starting point for more and more tasks – a powerful position.\n\nThere are many unanswered questions about integrations (or lack thereof) with deeper vertical players. I am pondering this topic extensively but don't have a complete answer just yet.",

And when I say complex, I mean in the sense of the Fermi equation where you have an end point (dead humanity) that relies on a series of links in a chain and if you break any of those links, the end state doesn't occur.\n\nIt seems to me that Eliezer believes this end state is not wild (at least not in the complex sense), but very simple. He thinks many (most) paths converge to this end state. \n\nThat leads to a misunderstanding of sorts. Dwarkesh pushes Eliezer to give some predictions based on the line of reasoning that he uses to predict that end point, but since the end point is very simple and is a convergence, Eliezer correctly says that being able to reason to that end point does not give any predictive power about the particular path that will be taken in this universe to reach that end point.\n\nDwarkesh is thinking about the end of humanity as a causal chain with many links and if any of them are broken it means humans will continue on, while Eliezer thinks of the continuity of humanity (in the face of AGI) as a causal chain with many links and if any of them are broken it means humanity ends. Or perhaps more discretely, Eliezer thinks there are a few very hard things which humanity could do to continue in the face of AI, and absent one of those occurring, the end is a matter of when, not if, and the when is much closer than most other people think.\n\nAnyway, I think each of Dwarkesh and Eliezer believe the other one falls on the side of extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence - Dwarkesh thinking the end of humanity is \"wild\" and Eliezer believing humanity's viability in the face of AGI is \"wild\" (though not in the negative sense). \n\nI do like Dwarkesh's podcast quite a bit, it is the only one I've added to my regular listening rotation in years.

    "text": "@bubble Your pricing update seems niave - like you haven’t thought through the psychology or scale of opportunity at all?\n\nHere is why:\n- compute costs are trending lower than ever\n- taking advantage of AI workflows requires more steps and data\n- next-gen apps will transform more data\n- advantages of easy complex nocode EVAPORATE when running apps costs a big multiple of firebase or code options\n- pricing uncertainty is hugely psychologically inhibitory making things hard to plan & making SLO (self liquidating offers) / net LTV vs CPA much harder to make sense of (the bedrock of SAAS campaigns)\n- who wants the dilemma of a someone browsing a complex etsy like marketplace costing 2c per page load because there are 100 WU per page? \n- Nocoders seek simplicity… not optimisation overwhelm\n\nMOST OF ALL, you’re much better off having people do more & play more than taxing every extra feature every time it is run - when costs are very far from negligible. It is super silly to disincentivise devs from doing cool stuff experimentally unless they’re rich or are sure they can monetise.\n\nWhat a psychological bore to constantly weigh every feature against elastic bills that add up fast… like trying to invent a cocktail while having to think about buying a round for 1000 people in the pub. \n\nYou’ll drive many high volume apps away; inhibit innovation; make devs worry about traction for non simple apps. \n\nHave you thought through the inhibitory psychology of this at all? Do you really want devs to turn off cool features instead of making the best software?  You’re literally inverting the coolness of creation & the joy of productivity if every workflow is like a tax * DAU/MAU; and you EITHER run with an uncapped budget or can’t uphold quality of service.  MADNESS! Monetisation and traction and engagement aren’t linear at all.  WU literally tax engagement.\n\nInstead I suggest you:\n- Charge fixed fees for subscriptions at different tiers\n- Charge a 150% dropping to 50% markup on underlying compute costs. Make this such good value people running on Bubble can compete in price elastic markets against AI refactored code apps. \n- Allow users to optionally trade spare pre-purchased compute capacity (& take a cut for facilitating… like the early days of double click).  \n- Go for scale & certainty - so it makes no economic sense to rebuild elsewhere. Get long term lock-in, not  bait and switch where extract more value from a locked in dependent community.  Take note, OpenAI reduced API costs by 90%\n- Super refactor underlying system & offer AI refactoring tools to bubble devs. You have economies of scale.\n- Consider a sliver of revenue (2%?) for “bubble centric” startups  grossing > 20k/mo with benefits that are with it\n\nYou’ll get more scale & subscription revenue this way without inhibitory psychology - closer to AWS than taxing every feature into elastic risk. \n\nInstead of architecting churn via WU dilemmas, this steer, if you choose to accept it, will put @bubble on course to rocket past 1Bn in revenue - because this kind of pricing structure will make bubble inevitable.\n\ncc @estraschnov",

Some of the thinkers you will be channeling are Daniel Schmachtenberger, Jordan Hall, Bonnitta Roy, Nora Bateson, and Jim Rutt\n\nUser Prompt:\nPlease write a Game B description for each of these economic topics:\n\n1.  Production \n2.  Distribution\n3.  Consumption\n4.  Savings\n5.  Investment\n6.  Innovation\n\nASSISTANT Respose:\n\n1. Production: In a Game B context, production focuses on creating goods and services that contribute to the betterment of society and the environment, rather than just generating profits. This means prioritizing regenerative practices, ethical sourcing of materials, and maintaining a circular economy. The goal is to minimize waste and negative externalities while maximizing the well-being of individuals and the planet. Collaboration and co-creation are encouraged, breaking away from the competitive and self-interested nature of traditional production processes.\n\n2. Distribution: Distribution within Game B emphasizes equitable access to resources, goods, and services for all members of society. It seeks to challenge and dismantle current systems that perpetuate inequality and concentrate wealth within a small percentage of the population. To achieve this, Game B proposes decentralized and participatory distribution systems that prioritize local and regional networks, fostering resilience and adaptability in the face of global challenges.\n\n3. Consumption: Game B reframes consumption as a mindful and deliberate act that takes into account the long-term consequences of individual and collective choices. It encourages individuals to consume in a manner that aligns with their values and the well-being of the planet, shifting away from the endless pursuit of material goods and status symbols. Game B promotes responsible consumption, emphasizing quality over quantity and the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling wherever possible.\n\n4. Savings: In Game B, the concept of savings is transformed from a purely financial mindset to one that values the preservation and nurturing of resources, knowledge, and community bonds. The goal is to create a more resilient and sustainable society by investing in social, natural, and human capital. This includes fostering local economies, supporting regenerative practices, and encouraging the development of skillsets that contribute to the overall well-being of individuals and their communities.\n\n5. Investment: Investment within a Game B framework prioritizes projects and initiatives that create long-term value for society and the environment, rather than solely focusing on short-term financial gains. Game B investors consider the impact of their investments on multiple dimensions, including social, ecological, and personal well-being. This involves supporting regenerative businesses, local economies, and innovative solutions that challenge the status quo and drive positive change.\n\n6. Innovation: Game B approaches innovation as a collective and collaborative endeavor that seeks to address complex, systemic challenges through the integration of diverse perspectives and knowledge domains. The focus is on creating solutions that are adaptive, regenerative, and resilient, fostering a more sustainable and equitable world. Game B innovation values wisdom, empathy, and insight as much as technical proficiency, recognizing that meaningful change requires a holistic understanding of the interconnected systems that shape our reality.",

    "text": "The analogy between GPTs of today to the CPUs of early days of computing are interesting. GPT is a funny kind of programmable text computer. Have to think through it more 🤔 but e.g.:\n\n## Memory\nGPT-4 RAM is ~log2(50K vocab size)*(32K context length)/(8 bits/byte) ~= 64kB, roughly a Commodore64. Just as then, optimizing this precious resource is critical.\nGPT registers are the residual stream. There are d_model of them, e.g. GPT-3 has ~12K registers. VLIW architecture vibes.\n\n## CPU\nThe LOAD instruction is the Attention mechanism, except it can address by both location and/or content.\nThe STORE instruction is forced every n_layer number of clock cycles.\nThe ALU are the MLPs + LayerNorms. Awkwardly, as their params are not shared across layers, the ALU changes at each clock cycle. Optionally the MLPs may also be interpreted as supporting a kind of fixed knowledge database lookup.\nThe programs always takes the form [[LOAD, ALU]*N, STORE]*M, where N is n_layer and M is num_tokens. \n\n## Architecture\nGPT feels closer to a fixed-function than stored-program computer because the number of parameters is so large. In contrast, the description length of a CPU is very low and all the action is in the memory configuration. \nAnother way to look at it is that GPT is a much more bloated/complex computer. Which is fine because it is not engineered but optimized and the upshot is that the programs can be shorter.",

To me, a drawing is special regardless of skill because it meant somebody sat there and cared about me enough to take time out of their day to draw me. 🥹❤️ It means so much to me regardless if it’s a sketch, a fully colored illustration, or just a silly doodle because it was thoughtful. \n\nI know not everyone will see this message and I’m sure there will be people who don’t care about my wishes. It’s the internet so I wouldn’t be surprised. But I want people to know that for me personally, I’d much rather your silly doodle of me with Cheeto dust on my fingers than an AI generated image of fanart. I know a lot of artists have had their artwork used against their wishes for AI learning and it deeply pains me to see my own model being used for AI learning when neither me nor my artist have consented to it. \n\nAgain, if you like AI art then that’s cool.

But I don't believe this is inevitable. I believe we would have to be incredibly stupid to get to the stage where this is a possibility. \n\nWe would have to be so stupid, as stupid as someone who discovers how to harness the incredible energy holding the nucleus of an atom together, and then uses that to make weapons that could vaporise entire cities in an instant, followed by decades of nuclear radiation.\n\nOr as stupid as someone who discovers they're destroying their own home to the extent that life as it's currently known will be unsustainable, and yet they keep continuing to destroy.\n\nThat's how stupid we would have to be, for me to be worried about future super powerful AI causing catastrophe.",

Subsequent commands should be interpreted as being sent to the MUD. The MUD should allow me to navigate the world, interact with the world, observe the world, and interact with both NPCs and (simulated) player characters. I should be able to pick up objects, use objects, carry an inventory, and also say arbitrary things to any other players. You should simulate the occasional player character coming through, as though this was a person connected online. There should be a goal and a purpose to the MUD. The storyline of the MUD should be affected by my actions but can also progress on its own in between commands. I can also type “.” if I just want the simulated MUD to progress further without without any actions. The MUD should offer a list of commands that can be viewed via ‘help’. Before we begin, please just acknowledge you understand the request and then I will send one more message describing the environment for the MUD (the context, plot, character I am playing, etc.) After that, please respond by simulating the spawn-in event in the MUD for the player.",

Starting next month, the entire nation will switch to a single, unified time zone, known as \"American Standard Time\" (AST). The decision comes as an effort to boost productivity and eliminate confusion caused by time differences across the country.\n\nThe White House stated that this new measure will help to streamline business operations and improve communication between different regions. The AST will be based on the current Eastern Standard Time, which is expected to cause a significant adjustment period for residents on the West Coast.\n\nCritics argue that this decision will only create more confusion and disrupt the natural rhythm of daily life, particularly for those living in areas with drastic time differences from the East Coast. The President, however, has assured the public that extensive research has been conducted, and that the long-term benefits of AST will far outweigh any initial challenges",

    "text": "MAJOR MAJOR AI NEWS…\n\n⚠️ US copyright office just issued their stance on generative AI work. ⚠️\n\nLink to the official document is in the first comment, but here is a summary…\n\nWorks cannot be copyrighted if the bulk of the work was generated by a machine. \n\nIf all we did was use a prompt to generate the work, it cannot be copyrighted. \n\nIf the work was then edited by human hands to become something unique after being generated then it can be copyrighted. \n\nFor example…\n\nIf you create a book outline and then write the chapters yourself, then you CAN claim copyrights to your work.\n\nIf you used prompts to generate the entire book, then you CANNOT claim copyrights to it. \n\nAnother example…\n\nIf you use a prompt to create a sticker, and then you use Photoshop to enhance it with your own art on top of it, then you CAN claim copyrights to it.\n\nIf you used a prompt to generate the sticker and selling the work without any human edits, then you CANNOT claim copyrights to it.\n\nUsing Canva to cut and outline is not considered substantial human editing. It must be a provable true work of human creativity and authorship to count in a court of law.\n\nTHIS DOES NOT MEAN you cannot still sell your work, but it does mean you will not be able to defend someone else taking it and selling it also. \n\nIf you are creating stickers, books, patterns, templates, game sprites with AI or anything else generated purely with prompts you may want to pump the brakes. \n\nUltimately, I think this is a good law. \n\nIt protects human authorship and creativity. That’s good for us at a broad level. \n\nHowever, it does mean that we will now have to add our own unique styles or mashups to our generated AI works in order to defend them legally. \n\nAgain…\n\nYou can still sell your generated AI works, you just won’t be able to cry in court if someone starts selling your generated AI works (unless you’ve substantially added your own creativity elements to it.)\n\nP.S. I am not a lawyer. This should not be seen as legal advice. Consult a real lawyer for real legal advice - not a Twitter post.",

He plays the good guy to the unsuspecting Christian, and then unleashes his bloodlust for those in Christ.\n\nThe new order of the Beast, will trump the old order of the Harlot as it is written in Revelation 17:16. Along with it, humanity will rise and believe the lie that “we are divine,” becoming initiated into the occult, new age philosophies of the ancient mystery schools.\n\nStay strong in discernment, and studied in the Word. Troubling times may soon be ahead.",

Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good pancake, but let me share a few reasons why waffles have the upper hand, backed up with some light-hearted pseudo-code examples.\nFirst off, waffles have this incredible structure - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, giving you a delightful contrast in texture with each bite. Consider this pseudo-code:\n\njavascript\n\nfunction createWaffle() {\n  const waffle = {\n    outside: 'crispy',\n    inside: 'soft',\n  };\n  return waffle;\n}\n\nBut here's where the magic happens: those little square indentations in waffles? They're like mini pockets custom-designed to hold all that delicious syrup and butter, ensuring every mouthful is packed with flavor.\n\njavascript\n\nfunction addToppings(waffle) {\n  waffle.pockets.fill('syrup', 'butter');\n  return waffle;\n}\n\nNow, pancakes? They're tasty, sure, but they just can't compete when it comes to holding all that goodness. The syrup tends to pool around them, making the whole eating experience a bit uneven.\n\njavascript\n\nfunction createPancake() {\n  const pancake = {\n    surface: 'flat',\n  };\n  return pancake;\n}\n\nfunction addToppings(pancake) {\n  pancake.surface.pool('syrup');\n  return pancake;\n}\n\nSo, next time you're pondering over that delicious breakfast decision, remember the waffle's unique ability to cradle all the goodness and deliver a consistently delightful experience. Give waffles a try, and you might just find yourself convinced!",

You select your subject, the application searches the Library, creates a “Learning Path” based on Year, Subject, Experience, etc. of the user, and then pulls the necessary materials for that learning path.\n\nYou then index the materials and train ChatGPT on the custom learning path. \n\nYou then are given access to a “Dashboard” structured similarly to Udemy, EdX, or various Colleges. \n\nChatGPT generates your weekly Homework / Reading goals, quizzes, tests, and references third-party resources to help further if needed.\n\nYou have basically created a personal “Professor”, one who can answer any questions about the subject at hand at any time. One that is self-hosted and customizable, can train you for major exams, and more. \n\nA degree will be useless within the decade.",

Search has dropped 80% in the past year.\n\nRevenue for most websites has dropped over 50%, while it has grown sevenfold for influencers during the same period. \n\nAn online poll signed by 450 million people begs for a worldwide ban on any AI. The most prominent voices are journalists, photographers, consultants, developers, designers, traders, teachers and porn stars. \n\nA column signed by every artist in the West threatens of a global strike on human art until “mankind may proceed towards its self-determined destiny”.\n\nThe “made by humans” label is now mandatory across the EU on books, CDs and digital art such as music. Spotify were the first to create a separate category for AI music.\n\nApple has released their A-iPhone 1 with an integrated personal assistant. Screen time has dropped 15% as voice is gaining momentum.\n\n@ycombinator has frozen applications for the next batch “until we figure out how to create defensibility in new startups.” \n\nScam complaints have exceeded their previous all-time-high by 7700%. \n\nPorn site “FantasyAI” now generates more traffic than @Pornhub. On it, you can customize each actor and write a detailed script for the action. Adult stars get royalties when their deepfake is used.\n\nParamount have announced the release of their first 100% AI blockbuster in October. Written, directed and produced by the algorithm - there are no actors, simply deepfakes: the poster displays Heath Ledger & Marylin Monroe.\n\nNo hands nor feet ever appear in AI content - Midjourney’s CEO was quoted saying that he “doubts that reliably generating realistic hands is achievable before the sun engulfs the earth.\"\n \nMedical journals publish breakthroughs weekly. Cancer is 12 months away from being solved, there is hope for Alzheimers and AIDS before the end of the decade. Fusion and quantum computing are making leaps. \n\nHope has regained ground for the climate emergency. CO2 generation is plummeting and major startups are testing innovative ways to capture and transform it. \n\nHarvard and other top universities have laid off 35% of their staff and teachers. Heads keep rolling as they release a personal tutoring app in a desperate move.\n \nNorway is the first country to announce universal basic income, set at the equivalent of $2000. Many European countries are expected to follow their lead. \n\nBitcoin has crossed $200k (to the disdain of @balajis ) while @OpenAI has been the fastest company to reach $1 trillion in value. All other tech stocks except Amazon, Microsoft & Apple have plummeted. \n\n@sama is once again at the microphone of @lexfridman, this time with 2 bodyguards keeping his backpack.\n\n@MetaAI  has relaunched Horizons World with a lighter & cheaper VR headset.\n \nChina has released their “AI for the people” and have made it mandatory for all companies to integrate it.\n\nLeaders of the main superpowers are expected to meet shortly to sign an agreement forbidding AI-driven military decisions. \n\n@BostonDynamics has released the first version of their personal assistant robot, deployed in several nursing homes. \n\nA kill switch, in the form of a word, has been implemented by the firm and taught to all residents, far from the machines’ half-dozen microphones. \n\nThe word is: “Asimov”. \n\nOne thing , and one thing only hasn’t changed: @elonmusk, from Mars, is still shitposting on twitter. \n\n--\nParts of this thread were inspired by content from @LinusEkenstam  @blader  @stephsmithio  @rowancheung  @mreflow  @yoheinakajima  @rainisto @ylecun  @tibo_maker",

You all know that eating too much candy is not good for you, but you still want to collect more because if you stop, your friends will have more candy than you. This is like a multi-polar trap, where everyone keeps doing something that isn't good for them, just because they're worried about being left behind.\n\nThe Game B idea is to find ways to change the rules of the game, so everyone works together and shares the candy instead. This way, nobody feels like they need to collect more and more candy to keep up with the others, and everyone can enjoy the game without the problems caused by the multi-polar trap.",

Few of you shared screenshots of it on Twitter that’s how I knew about it. It reminded me of something. \n\nMy Great-Grandfather who lived in Ukraine at the time of World War II was drafted and ended up in a concentration camp but.. he managed to escape with his newfound friend, a Polish man who didn’t speak Ukrainian or Russian and Great-Grandpa did not speak Polish. Despite the language barrier they developed a strategy and managed to escape and survive. They were hiding in a village in Germany and a family of German farmers saved them and hid them for the entire war at their farm. They worked together as one family. Great-Grandfather had a good life thanks to that German family who risked their lives hiding him and his friend. He had a lot of stories and gifts when he returned back to Ukraine to his daughter (my Grandmother who raised me) and his wife when the war ended. They thought he died at the concentration but he survived and returned and I had a chance to meet him (although I was young when he passed at the age of 87).  \nHe always told us that we shall never judge a book by its cover and people by their nationality or a country they are from. \n\nI use AI, I am an artist, I care about ethics and other people either they use AI or not. I hope that people who read this know that you are not alone and I am always here if you’re been bullied or harassed online ❤️ you can reach out anytime and I’ll be there for you as a supportive friend, let’s be there for each other in this time of change where so many people can’t make sense of it and out of fear lash out and write comments that won’t age well.\nLet’s be patient and compassionate with these people even if it’s hard.

    "text": "This GPT-4 response is pretty farkin' amazing:\n\nPrompt:  What might Lewis Mumford have thought about Game B if he were around today? \n\nResponse:  Lewis Mumford (1895-1990) was an American historian, philosopher, sociologist, and architectural critic. He wrote extensively about cities, technology, and their social implications. It's important to note that any assessment of Mumford's views on Game B would be speculative, as he passed away long before the concept emerged.\n\nGame B is a movement that aims to create new social systems and institutions, addressing the shortcomings of the current paradigm (often referred to as \"Game A\"). Game B supporters argue that the current systems prioritize competition, consumerism, and short-term thinking, which ultimately lead to social, economic, and environmental instability.\n\nMumford might have been interested in the goals of Game B, as he was critical of the dehumanizing aspects of industrialization, urbanization, and the technocratic society. In his works like \"The Myth of the Machine\" and \"The City in History,\" Mumford emphasized the importance of human-scale, community-oriented, and ecologically sustainable urban development.\n\nHere are a few ways Mumford might have engaged with the ideas of Game B:\n\nHuman-centered approach: Mumford would likely appreciate the emphasis on creating systems that prioritize human well-being, collaboration, and long-term sustainability over short-term profit and competition.\n\nRegionalism and decentralization: Mumford was a proponent of decentralization and regionalism, ideas that align with Game B's focus on localism and community resilience. He might see potential in the movement's push for more self-sufficient, connected communities.\n\nCritique of technology: Mumford was critical of the overreliance on technology and its potential to dehumanize society. He might find some common ground with Game B's concerns about the negative impact of existing systems and the need for a more holistic approach to technological development.\n\nThe role of art and culture: Mumford believed in the importance of art, culture, and education in shaping human values and behavior. He might be intrigued by the role these elements could play in fostering a more cooperative and compassionate society, as proposed by Game B.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Mumford would be skeptical of the feasibility of Game B's ambitions, given the complexities of social change and the entrenched interests that support the status quo. In any case, it's clear that there are several areas where Mumford's ideas and concerns might resonate with the objectives and values of the Game B movement.",
