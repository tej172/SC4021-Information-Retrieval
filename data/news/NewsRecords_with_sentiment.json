This reflects a growing demand from companies and employers for highly skilled professionals in AI and technology-related fields.\n\nAt the same time, employees are becoming more aware of how AI will affect their careers. Some have switched careers entirely, moving into the tech industry, recognizing that AI-related roles often offer lucrative salaries. Others see AI as a tool that can enhance their current job performance, while some are concerned that intelligent robots and chatbots might replace their roles.\n\nHowever, a 2020 report from the World Economic Forum predicted that by the end of 2025, AI could displace around 85 million traditional jobs. Yet, at the same time, it is expected to create 97 million new jobs, suggesting that employment opportunities in this field may be greater than many anticipate.",

        "text": "Recent analyses indicate a significant rise in unemployment within the information technology sector, with figures climbing from 3.9% in December to 5.7% in January.\n\nThis equates to an increase from 98,000 to 152,000 unemployed IT professionals. In contrast, the broader economy added 143,000 jobs during the same period, albeit at a decelerated pace.\n\nAI adoption linked to increasing IT job cuts\n\nA primary factor contributing to this trend is the growing integration of artificial intelligence and automation in business operations.\n\nTasks within IT that are routine and mundane, such as reporting and clerical administration, are increasingly being automated.\n\nVictor Janulaitis, CEO of Janco Associates, notes that companies are also looking to reduce the number of programmers and systems designers, anticipating that AI will offer value and a favourable return on investment.\n\nThe shift towards AI is leading to a decrease in demand for certain IT roles. For instance, job postings in software development declined by 8.5% in January compared to the previous year.\n\nMajor technology firms have been announcing massive layoffs: Meta plans to cut 5% of its workforce and Workday has announced an 8.5% reduction.\n\nThe impact of AI on jobs is not equally distributed\n\nThe impact of AI on employment is not uniform across all sectors. White-collar and knowledge workers are particularly susceptible to AI-induced job displacement.\n\nConversely, roles that require in-person presence and specialised skills remain in higher demand.\n\nEconomist Cory Stahle from Indeed observes a bifurcation in opportunities, with white-collar positions experiencing less employer demand compared to in-person skilled labour jobs, TechRadar reported.\n\nThe trend of increasing corporate investment in AI suggests potential future reductions in hiring, a concept some industry leaders refer to as \u201ccost avoidance\u201d.\n\nInstead of recruiting new employees for tasks that can be automated, businesses are opting to implement AI solutions, thereby achieving cost savings.\n\nOverall, the IT sector is witnessing a notable rise in unemployment, driven by the adoption of AI and automation.\n\nWhile this technological advancement offers efficiency and cost benefits, it also presents challenges for certain segments of the workforce, particularly those involved in routine and administrative tasks.\n\nWhat the rising job cuts in IT mean for businesses\n\nThe recent uptick in IT sector unemployment underscores a critical shift in the employment landscape due to the proliferation of AI and automation technologies.\n\nAs organisations increasingly adopt AI to streamline operations, tasks that are repetitive and administrative in nature are becoming automated, leading to a reduced need for human intervention in these areas.\n\nThe trend is particularly evident in roles such as reporting and clerical administration, which are now being efficiently handled by AI systems.\n\nFurthermore, companies are reassessing the necessity of roles like programmers and systems designers, with the expectation that AI can fulfil these functions more effectively and economically.\n\nThis presents both challenges and opportunities for business and HR leaders.\n\nThe decline in demand for certain IT roles necessitates a strategic approach to workforce planning. This compels many to identify which roles are susceptible to automation and to develop strategies for reskilling or redeploying affected employees.\n\nInvesting in employee development programs focused on skills that are complementary to AI, such as strategic thinking, complex problem-solving, and interpersonal communication, can enhance workforce adaptability.\n\nFostering a culture of continuous learning will also prepare employees to engage with AI tools effectively, thereby augmenting their roles rather than being displaced by technology.\n\nThe concept of cost avoidance through AI implementation should be balanced with considerations of employee morale and organisational culture.\n\nTransparent communication about the integration of AI and its implications for the workforce can mitigate uncertainty and resistance.\n\nWhile AI offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency and cost reduction, it also necessitates a thoughtful approach to human resource management.\n\nLeaders and managers can ensure a harmonious integration of technology and human capital \u2013 leading to sustained organisational success \u2013 but only by addressing the impact of AI on employment head-on.",

        "text": "Vietnam's AI Job Market Thrives With High Salaries Companies are seeking skilled workers without traditional qualifications and offering attractive remote work options.\n\nVietnam is witnessing a remarkable surge in demand for jobs related to artificial intelligence (AI), with opportunities arising from both domestic and international companies. Amidst this boom, one company stands out for its unconventional recruitment strategy: Smallest AI.\n\nCEO Sudarshan Kamath, hailing from India, recently stirred discussions with his hiring announcement on social media, stating the company would not require traditional academic qualifications or even historical resumes from job applicants. He is seeking full-time software engineers, offering lucrative compensation exceeding 1.1 billion VND (approximately 40 lakh rupees) annually, which includes base salaries ranging from 438 to 730 million VND, plus stock options valued at 292 to 438 million VND. This approach marks a significant shift, as candidates with less than two years of experience or even no prior qualifications can apply.\n\nThe focus on skill rather than academic pedigree signifies broader trends occurring within the tech job market. Companies are increasingly prioritizing practical abilities and real-world experience over formal education. While by no means the norm, such positions hint at changing dynamics as employers adapt to the rapid pace of technological advancement and the resulting competition for talent.\n\nRecent statistics have shown strong growth of AI job listings, particularly following the launch of ChatGPT. The demand not only reflects the rise of transformative technology but the challenge of integrating it smoothly within existing workforce structures. Current data from Google indicates surging interest, with searches for AI-related jobs hitting record levels as of January 2025. The World Economic Forum has made the bold prediction of 85 million jobs being displaced by AI by the end of 2025, but concurrently, they estimate upwards of 97 million new jobs will be created.\n\nAmong the most sought-after roles within the booming AI sector include AI engineers, AI consultants, and AI researchers, according to findings from job platforms like ZipRecruiter and Indeed. The average salaries for these positions are impressive: AI engineers command about 106,386 USD (around 2.7 billion VND), whereas AI consultants and researchers draw even higher, around 113,566 USD and 113,102 USD annually, respectively.\n\nInterestingly, many of these roles come with the flexibility of remote work, allowing executives and tech workers to operate outside conventional office environments. This newfound flexibility, paired with the high compensation, makes AI jobs increasingly attractive to workers across sectors.\n\nRyan Sutton, CEO of Robert Half Technology, weighed in on this shift, noting the prevalence of demand-based hiring practices. He remarked, \u201cmany are leaving college early or not pursuing higher education at all to join startups or work full-time within the sector.\u201d Consequently, organizations are rethinking their requirements to assemble the best teams possible, highlighting the increasing intersection between technology and education.\n\nFor many, the prospect of pursuing a career within AI is more promising than ever, opening doors with less restrictive entry requirements. Five of the fastest-growing roles currently include AI trainers and product managers, all demonstrating strong potential for development and innovation within the workforce. While higher educational backgrounds may still be beneficial for certain positions, companies are valuing skill acquisition, programming, software development, and content creation above formal credentials.\n\nAI has transformed the employment ecosystem, leading to increased competition for job seekers yet abundant opportunities for those with the appropriate skills. Facing this novel reality, job seekers are encouraged to adapt and refine their existing abilities to suit the requirements increasingly prioritized by potential employers.\n\nThis transformation not only emphasizes the importance of skills\u2014practical, technical, and specialized\u2014but also contributes to redefining what constitutes qualified candidates for lucrative positions in technology. The dialogue around AI and its impact on job roles generates discussions on economic empowerment and the future of work, marking the technology sector's evolution as one of the pivotal narratives of today's job market.",

        "text": "A new paper by Harvard economists David Deming and Lawrence H. Summers offers early evidence of artificial intelligence shaking up the workforce.\n\nThe study measures more than 100 years of \u201coccupational churn\u201d \u2014 or each profession\u2019s share in the U.S. labor market \u2014 for a historical look at technological disruption. It revealed a stretch of stability between 1990 and 2017 that runs counter to popular narratives about robots stealing American jobs. But the research also uncovered a recent shift, with the authors identifying several trends driven, at least partly, by AI.\n\n\u201cWe really thought the paper would say something like, \u2018See, I told you so. Things aren\u2019t changing all that much,\u2019\u201d said Deming, the Isabelle and Scott Black Professor of Political Economy at Harvard Kennedy School and Faculty Dean of Kirkland House. \u201cBut when we got into the data, we found the story was a bit more subtle \u2014 and more interesting in some ways \u2014 than anything we expected.\u201d\n\nFor years, Deming and Summers had talked about gauging occupational churn in the U.S. labor market over time. \u201cIt would be a systematic way to measure how much all these different types of technology have affected work,\u201d explained Deming, the paper\u2019s lead author.\n\nLabor market volatility over last century Employment share by industry, 1880-2024. Source: \u201cTechnical Disruption in the Labor Market\u201d\n\nLast year the economists applied the metric with help from Kennedy School predoctoral fellow Christopher Ong \u201923, the paper\u2019s third author. Their findings, drawn from 124 years of U.S. Census data, originally appeared in a volume published last fall by the Aspen Economic Strategy Group. Summers, a member of the OpenAI board of directors, shared further predictions in a live interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival.\n\nSummers was initially surprised by the level of volatility uncovered in the 1950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s due to the rise of what are called \u201cbreakthrough general-purpose technologies.\u201d \u201cBut when I thought about it, it wasn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and Frank and Denie Weil Director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cIt used to be that only a very limited number of people used keyboards. Now everybody uses keyboards and there are fewer people whose whole job is to use keyboards. That turned out to be a very big structural change that the economy managed.\u201d\n\nThe 2000s and 2010s were characterized by what Deming called \u201cautomation anxiety.\u201d As evidence, he pointed to an influential study from 2013 asserting that 47 percent of U.S. occupations were at imminent risk of displacement by computers. But the occupational churn metric showed the pace of disruption slowing by 1990 as the labor market entered a stretch of low churn.\n\nThen another surprise appeared in the data. \u201cFrom 2019 onward,\u201d Deming said, \u201cit looks like things were changing quite a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody should be thinking about AI, no matter what they do for a living.\u201d Lawrence H. Summers, study co-author\n\nIs AI a breakthrough technology along the lines of keyboards, electricity, and computer-based manufacturing? The co-authors\u2019 findings led them to believe so. As evidence, they outline four emerging trends in the U.S. job market.\n\nThe first concerns the end of what economists have termed job polarization \u2014 a barbell-shaped pattern, with the labor market growing at the top and bottom of the wage distribution.\n\nWhat appeared more recently, the researchers found, is a one-sided pattern favoring well-compensated employees with high levels of training and skill. \u201cThe trend people were worried about in the 2000s was the downward ramp,\u201d Deming said. \u201cThat meant low-paid jobs were growing but middle- and high-paid jobs were not. It\u2019s only in the late 2010s that we see an upward ramp, with mostly high-paid jobs that are growing.\u201d\n\nAnother trend, related to the first, finds a recent skyrocketing of science, technology, engineering, and math jobs following a surprising dip in the 2010s. The share of jobs in STEM \u2014 including software developers and data analysts \u2014 grew from 6.5 percent in 2010 to nearly 10 percent in 2024. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a lot,\u201d Deming said. \u201cBut it\u2019s an almost 50 percent increase.\u201d\n\nAnalyzing data sourced from the Census as well as the Federal Reserve Bank showed firms are not only hiring more technical talent, they\u2019ve started to make record-breaking investments in frontier technologies such as AI. \u201cYou really don\u2019t need to speculate about AI\u2019s impact on the labor market,\u201d Deming noted of these findings. \u201cInvestment in AI is already changing the distribution of jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nThe research also uncovered flat or declining employment specifically in low-paid service work. Charting the occupational churn in this sector, which saw enormous growth from 1980 to the early 2000s, revealed a cliff as of 2019. AI is just one possible explanation, Deming emphasized. Other contenders include higher wages, a tighter job market, and temporary disruptions related to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like many of these jobs are coming back,\u201d Deming added. \u201cThe ones that have returned are in food service, personal services like manicurists and hairdressers, medical assistants, and some cleaning jobs.\u201d\n\nThe paper\u2019s fourth trend suggests an especially deep plummet, driven by technology, in retail sales jobs. Between 2013 and 2023, the share of retail sales jobs dropped from 7.5 to 5.7 percent of the job market, a reduction of 25 percent.\n\nThe co-authors note that the e-commerce sector was an early adopter of predictive AI, and has more than doubled its share of all retail sales since 2015.\n\n\u201cI see the pandemic as an accelerant, as something that was going to happen anyway,\u201d Deming said. \u201cWhen people were told it\u2019s dangerous, possibly even deadly, to go shopping \u2014 now they had to shop online \u2014 they discovered it actually wasn\u2019t so bad and formed new habits.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody should be thinking about AI, no matter what they do for a living,\u201d Summers added. \u201cBecause AI can be highly empowering. But it also means certain types of activities won\u2019t be done by people anymore.\u201d\n\nThe paper contains a nugget of insight for knowledge workers in sectors like finance, management, and journalism. Automation has indeed claimed American jobs over the last century. In a Substack post, Deming cited the early 20th-century example of telephone operators. But AI\u2019s impact is more likely to enable short-term boosts to productivity with longer-term threats of displacement by workers more adept with the technology.\n\n\u201cWhen companies start to get squeezed \u2014 when we hit the next recession or something \u2014 they\u2019re going to start expecting more out of knowledge workers,\u201d Deming said. \u201cThey won\u2019t want that memo in two days, because they know this technology is available. They\u2019ll want it in two hours.\u201d",

It found that over 60% of employers expect digital access to drive business transformation, with 86% predicting AI and information processing technologies will have the greatest impact by 2030.\n\nFollowed by Robots and autonomous systems at 58% and energy generation and storage technologies transformations at 41%.\n\n\u201cThese trends are expected to have a divergent effect on jobs, driving both the fastest-growing and fastest-declining roles, and fueling demand for technology-related skills, including AI and big data, networks and cybersecurity and technological literacy, which are anticipated to be the top three fastest- growing skills,\u201d the international organization said.\n\nAccording to its research, the high market growth in AI investment was fueled by the fast usage of generative AI also known as \u2018GenAI\u2018 like ChatGPT. The findings also revealed that GenAI skills are expected to be in high demand among both businesses and individuals.\n\n\u201cAlthough more generalized adoption of AI applications remains comparatively low, with only a small fraction of firms using it in 2023, adoption is growing rapidly, albeit unevenly across sectors,\u201d it also explained.\n\nThe WEF also cited previous studies, explaining that GenAI could enable less specialized employees to take on expert tasks and enhance skilled professionals with cutting-edge knowledge, boosting efficiency.\n\nOther transformative trends expected to drive businesses include the rising cost of living (ranked second), climate change mitigation (third), demographic shifts, and geoeconomic fragmentation alongside geopolitical tensions.",

This is disrupting conventional career paths by rendering specific jobs obsolete while generating demand for new sets of skills for jobs unheard of until recently. We witnessed how intelligent manufacturing had automated workflow and processes, which reduced the need for human intervention and manual labour jobs. We are seeing AI-driven analytics, which opens up new job opportunities in data science and machine learning.\n\n\u201cWe are in an age of chaos, an era that intensely, almost violently, rejects structure.\u201d In the face of such inevitability, adaptability has become a prerequisite for career success. Individuals must be open to embracing new technologies as their ancestors once did, from previous industrial revolutions to the digital revolution now. Employees must be willing to learn new skills to take on future and non-traditional roles which the AI-driven economy creates. Incumbents must pivot when necessary, such as updating obsoleted knowledge and skills to stay relevant in their field.\n\n\u201cIn the face of such inevitability, adaptability has become a prerequisite for career success.\u201d \u2013 Loh Pui Wah, Director, Career and Attachment Office, Nanyang Technological University (NTU)\n\n\n\nAs the AI-driven economy continues its momentum towards new and yet-to-be-discovered technology frontiers, the job market will evolve as developments unfold over time. Inevitably, it will result in setbacks and challenges for individuals who may be caught in the waves and turbulences of this transformation. Resilience, the ability to bounce back from adversity, is essential for weathering such storms. Whether job loss due to automation or encountering obstacles in career advancement, resilient individuals show perseverance and determination to overcome such difficulties. They see setbacks as catalysts for growth and adapt their strategies accordingly. They dig deep, draw upon inner strength, and show their grit in adversities.\n\nTo succeed in the AI world, individuals must proactively own and manage their career trajectories. Continuous learning is critical to success. This can be going back to school, attending online courses or on-the-job training. By keeping abreast of industry trends and acquiring in-demand skills, individuals can position themselves for success in a rapidly changing world.\n\nNetworking is particularly important too in developing successful and sustaining careers. Gaining professional contacts and fostering deep relationships within one\u2019s industry can lead to valuable opportunities and insights. In addition, cultivating a strong personal brand through online platforms such as LinkedIn can enhance visibility and attract potential employers and clients.\n\nFurthermore, adopting a growth mindset is vital for adapting to new challenges and seizing opportunities to recreate and reinvent new roles for us. Therefore, do not fear change. Get out of our comfort zones. Be curious and willing to learn even new things which seemingly not related to our current roles. By cultivating a mindset focused on continuous self-improvement, we can thrive in an ever-changing job market.\n\nREAD MORE: In the \u2018age of AI\u2019, sustainable leadership is vital\n\nIn conclusion, the \u201crise of machines\u201d in the guise of AI is reshaping traditional career trajectories, creating both opportunities and challenges for individuals in the job market. Adaptability and resilience have emerged as critical attributes for navigating this changing landscape, where traditional roles are evolving, and new ones are emerging. By embracing lifelong learning, fostering resilience, and adopting a growth mindset, individuals can successfully navigate the complexities of the AI-driven job market and achieve success in the \u201cBrave New (digital) World.\u201d\n\nAbout the author: Loh Pui Wah is Director, Career and Attachment Office, at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).",

        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nTechnology has a long history of profoundly reshaping the world of work. From the dawn of the agricultural revolution to the digital age, each wave of innovation has redefined the structure, nature and dynamics of labour markets.\n\nToday, the world is on the brink of another technological revolution, enabled by artificial intelligence, that has the potential to reshape the world of work yet again. This coming wave is likely to arrive more quickly than its predecessors, given the pace of technological adoption has been accelerating and because AI itself is advancing so quickly. Policymakers need to prepare now to ensure their workers and labour markets are equipped to ride the coming wave and benefit from it.\n\nIn this report we use novel analysis to explore how AI could affect the labour market, with specific reference to the United Kingdom. Although much discussion of AI is currently based around large language models (LLMs), this is part of a broader story about automation, which takes in physical tasks as well as cognitive ones. Our study therefore aims to take a wider view that incorporates a broader definition of AI, including AI-enabled hardware, and that examines three key ways that AI could affect the labour market: through demand, supply and by changing the workplace experience:\n\nLabour demand: We estimate that full and effective adoption of AI by UK firms could save almost a quarter of private-sector workforce time \u2013 equivalent to the annual output of 6 million workers.\n\nThe potential for AI to save time and boost productivity will vary significantly at the individual-worker level. Our analysis suggests that most of the time savings from AI are likely to come from the use of AI-enabled software that performs cognitive tasks, rather than more costly AI-enabled hardware that focuses on physical work. As a result, occupations and sectors that involve complex manual work such as the skilled trades or construction are likely to be less exposed to AI. By contrast, those workers who perform routine cognitive tasks, particularly in administrative occupations, and those who work in data-intensive industries where it is easier to train new AI models (such as banking and finance), are likely to be more exposed.\n\nGiven the high degree of uncertainty over how quickly, how fully, and how effectively AI could perform existing tasks and save workers\u2019 time, we look at a range of scenarios to help assess its potential macroeconomic impact. In all cases, AI is expected to generate some job losses, but this labour-substitution effect is only part of the story of how AI will affect labour demand. AI is also likely to create new demand for labour by boosting economic growth and speeding the development of new products and services that create entirely new jobs. Over history, technology\u2019s impact on labour demand has been a tale of the push and pull between these two forces of labour substitution and demand creation, and over the long run they have tended to balance out.\n\nOur analysis tells a similar story. In all our scenarios we expect unemployment to rise initially as some firms choose to bank the time savings from AI and reduce the size of their workforce. Based on historic rates of labour shedding, we estimate 1 to 3 million jobs could ultimately be displaced by AI. Crucially however, these job displacements will not occur all at once, but instead will rise gradually with the pace of AI adoption across the wider economy. On an annual basis, this means job displacements peak at between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs a year, which are relatively modest figures compared with the average number of job losses seen over the past decade in the UK (450,000 per year) and even more so relative to the overall labour force (33 million).\n\nMoreover, the rise in unemployment is likely to be capped and ultimately offset as AI creates new demand for workers, which pulls displaced workers back into the workforce. Our best guess is that AI\u2019s peak impact on unemployment is likely to be in the low hundreds of thousands and for the effect to unwind over time. While there is a great deal of uncertainty over all these figures, a common lesson is that AI is likely to increase the dynamism of the labour market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. As a result, the UK\u2019s labour-market infrastructure will need an upgrade to adjust to the AI era.\n\nThese potential time savings from AI and associated rise in labour productivity will also boost economic growth. The scale of this effect is highly uncertain, and will depend both on the extent to which AI is adopted across the economy and how cost-effective it is to implement. Our analysis suggests that most kinds of AI have the potential to generate significant cost savings, but this is not guaranteed for all AI types. For example, bespoke AI software tools that are trained on a company\u2019s unique data as well as complex AI-enabled hardware are likely to prove prohibitively expensive for most small firms to develop on their own. For small firms to access these novel technologies, the technology will need to be developed at scale by other companies, \u201cplatformised\u201d (developed into tools that can be easily implemented across an industry) and then sold as a service (similar to how the market for cloud computing has developed). We explore these different possibilities in our scenario analysis and find that AI could raise UK national income by between 5 per cent and 14 per cent by 2050 with our most likely scenario pointing to a substantial 11 per cent boost, equivalent to more than \u00a3300 billion a year in today\u2019s terms.\n\nA key question in assessing AI\u2019s impact on the economy is judging when its impact will become sufficiently significant to show up in macroeconomic statistics. Predicting the point at which any technology starts to become widely adopted is inherently difficult, so we explore a range of timing assumptions in our analysis. In all cases we expect the impact of AI on the economy to be relatively modest in the near-term \u2013 raising GDP by between 0.1 and 1 per cent over the next five years and the level of unemployment by up to 180,000 by 2030. By 2035, the range of outcomes is much broader \u2013 with the level of gross domestic product (GDP) 0.6 to 6 per cent higher depending on the scenario. How this plays out in practice will depend not only on the fundamental nature of AI or decisions made by private-sector firms but also policy decisions that have the capacity to accelerate or delay the implementation of AI.\n\nLabour supply: AI has significant potential to improve the supply of labour, by increasing the quantity, quality and effective use of workers in the economy \u2013 all of which can add further to growth.\n\nFirst, we estimate that AI could assist both teachers and students in the classroom and raise educational attainment by around 6 per cent on average across students over their academic career. Emerging evidence suggests that lower-performing students are likely to experience the biggest boost from AI-enabled education, suggesting it could be a helpful social-levelling tool to equalise access to opportunities. A more educated workforce will be a more productive one, so as AI-educated students gradually enter the workforce they will raise productivity. While this is a slow-burn effect, it could be a substantial one \u2013 adding around 6 per cent cumulatively to GDP over the next 60 years.\n\nSecond, AI can support a healthier population and hence a healthier workforce, leading to fewer lost workdays, longer and more productive careers, and lower welfare costs. The country is in the foothills of AI applications in health services but already there is enormous potential for AI to speed up medical research, enable a preventative approach to health care, drive more efficient identification, treatment and discharge of people from the health system, and, importantly, spur further assistive technologies that can help disabled people or those with short-term health issues to re-enter the workforce.\n\nThird, there is potential for AI technologies to support better job-matching and improve the effective utilisation of labour \u2013 just as the advent of the internet did at the turn of the century. This is an area where design and controls become increasingly important, since bias arising from data patterns could lead to negative recruitment outcomes. One key element to retain is that of workers\u2019 agency, so rather than seeing the role of AI as matching passive workers to roles, it helps equip them with strategies and information that allow applicants to present themselves to best effect.\n\nWorkplace experience: People\u2019s day-to-day experience of the workplace could shift materially as AI tools become more prevalent. AI has the potential to improve job quality by reducing mundane tasks, improving access to the workplace for different types of workers, and helping to improve workplace health and safety. AI thus has the potential to help deliver a more engaging, inclusive and safe working environment. However, our survey of early adopters of AI in professional settings also highlighted that some have concerns that the workplace experience might change in other ways, for example with extra scrutiny of work leading to a more stressful working day. This means that careful management and communication of how AI is applied in the workplace will be a crucial element of the transition.\n\nOverall, there is emerging evidence that AI is having a transformative impact at the individual and company levels. Our forward-looking analysis suggests these early indicators are likely to be a foretaste of a much bigger transformative change to the world of work in the decades ahead. It would be a mistake to concentrate all policy direction on limiting the disruption that this will bring. Any policies designed to hold back the tide will likely be ineffective and damaging in the long term.\n\nInstead, we propose four key areas which government activity should focus on to maximise the benefits of AI in the workforce for the broadest possible part of society:\n\nA. Encourage the broad adoption of AI across the economy by reducing barriers to AI access and by harnessing its ability to improve education and skills for all. By doing so, governments can help ensure AI delivers on its promise as a social-levelling tool that equalises access to opportunities.\n\nB. Upgrade labour-market infrastructure to cope with the higher rate of churn and more dynamic pace of change that AI is likely to create. This includes equipping workers with knowledge of the coming changes and the support facilities \u2013 including financial safety nets, retraining opportunities and job-matching services \u2013 to help maximise employment.\n\nC. Harness the ability of AI to improve the quality of jobs, by shining a light on how AI is already being adopted across the economy \u2013 to share best practice to speed uptake and identify risk areas where firmer guardrails are needed.\n\nD. Finally, given the high degree of uncertainty around the path of AI and its potential impact, the government should engage in detailed scenario analysis and practical contingency planning to ensure it is prepared for the more radical future that is in prospect.\n\nA summary of detailed recommendations under these four themes is provided in the table below:\n\nThe future is uncertain. Some of the analysis in this report may need revisiting before too long. This will continue to be a dynamic environment in which the technology develops rapidly and its applications evolve in ways that cannot be foreseen.\n\nBut only by taking sensible steps now can the country best equip itself for success. For this reason TBI has aimed to develop a set of a dozen \u201cno-regrets\u201d policy recommendations that should bring benefits in a range of scenarios, backed up by a horizon-scanning function in recommendation 13.\n\nTaken together, this analysis and set of recommendations should provide a big step forward in the UK\u2019s mission to make the most of AI technology. AI can help everyone become more productive and better off. In doing so, it can support many of the other policy outcomes the government should pursue.\n\nChapter 1\n\nS e t t i n g t h e S c e n e\n\nContext\n\nArtificial intelligence is here today.[_] Its impact is already being felt in the economy, in public life and in day-to-day experiences. Although it\u2019s still the very early chapters of the story, the general-purpose nature of the technology and its potential to be adopted quickly make AI hugely consequential.\n\nNowhere is this more apparent than in the world of work. The history of people working alongside machines, and those machines taking on some or all of the tasks originally carried out by workers, is a long one. There is every reason to believe this will continue \u2013 and accelerate. Machines will increasingly take on tasks that are currently the preserve of humans while also spurring innovation that creates new jobs that don\u2019t yet exist. This will lead employers to restructure entirely the ways in which workplaces operate, and so the human impact will be apparent and increasingly obvious.\n\nHistory also tells us that the road to technological adoption is bumpy. Although technological progress is the cornerstone of rising living standards, it can also exacerbate inequality by displacing some jobs, favouring the well-resourced, and widening gaps in education and geography. AI has the potential to cause similar effects, but it also presents a potential tool for social levelling.[_] This needs to be wielded mindfully and shaped judiciously in order to realise a \u201ctechno-optimist\u201d future scenario.\n\nThe question is how governments should respond to the emergence of AI. Many governments might decide to wait and see, and react to disruption after the event. Others will seek to put safety first and intervene to establish as much control as possible so that change can be managed or minimised.\n\nEach of these approaches is mistaken. The first leaves policymakers at risk of seeming entirely unprepared; the latter is a charter for decline.\n\nThe aim for governments should be to adopt a pro-innovation, pro-technology stance while also being aware of the risks and possible short-term consequences. This is vital not just for reasons of equity and social cohesion, but also to maintain confidence and acceptance in the technology, and to guard against demands for easy-sounding answers that will simply undo the gains.\n\nFor all these reasons we felt it was important to apply a critical lens to some of the assumptions around the effect of AI on jobs, to explore a range of channels and to generate a set of recommendations for a progressive, ambitious approach.\n\nDefinition and Scope\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d must be close to the most used \u2013 and most flexibly used \u2013 phrase in current political discourse. Yet despite the explosion of interest in AI, there is no consensus on what the term means. For the purposes of this project, we use the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of AI[_] as our foundation: \u201cAn AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.\u201d\n\nThis definition focuses on the outputs that an AI system generates \u2013 for example: content, predictions, recommendations, decisions \u2013 and the objectives that these outputs are meant to achieve. It is widely recognised, and a version of it has been adopted by both the European Union[_] and the United States[_] in their AI acts.\n\nAI is not new. The first wave of AI began in the mid-20th century and was called symbolic AI, flourishing from the 1950s until the 1990s. It relied on quantifiable data and strict rule-based procedures with some allowances for uncertainty. Major symbolic AI achievements included one of the first chatbots, ELIZA, and the chess-playing expert system Deep Blue, which in 1997 beat Garry Kasparov, the world champion at the time.\n\nThe second (and current) wave of data-driven AI kicked off in the 2000s and accelerated in the 2010s with rapid uptake of the internet, which unlocked one of the key barriers stopping AI from scaling: data. This wave closely mimicked how human brains process information through deep learning and machine learning, and modelled uncertainty, randomness and complexity. It is best reflected in recent AI innovations such as ChatGPT or autonomous drones.\n\nBoth these waves constitute \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cnarrow\u201d AI in that they are specific and bound by task-based parameters. We\u2019ve excluded symbolic AI from our analysis under the assumption that any labour-market impacts from this wave have been witnessed and adjusted for already, given the technology\u2019s age and prevalence.\n\nAI capabilities, however, are fast evolving. The next wave is expected to be \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cgeneral\u201d AI (AGI). AGI applications will exhibit more autonomy, be able to adapt to different contexts and not be limited to specific tasks \u2013 similar to human capability. Beyond this, AI systems smarter than any individual human (\u201cartificial super intelligence\u201d) and systems smarter than all humans (\u201cthe singularity\u201d) are possible further in the future.\n\nFor the purposes of this project, we exclude these more advanced versions of AI because their disruptive potential is so great and they are still thought to be some decades away. For example, the Good Judgement Project\u2019s \u201csuperforecasters\u201d, who are particularly skilled at assessing probabilities of future outcomes, estimate there is only a 12 per cent chance of AGI being developed by 2043, 40 per cent by 2070 and 60 per cent by 2100.[_] AI experts are only slightly more optimistic, with half of a recent survey of more than 350 AI professionals estimating there is a 50-50 chance AGI will be developed by 2060.[_]\n\nOur Starting Point\n\nTBI analysed a range of literature from public and industry sources and complemented this with stakeholder engagement in the United States and Europe.[_]\n\nFrom this review, we can see that experts have come to a broad consensus on several fronts:\n\nAI is already driving double-digit productivity gains for early adopters on individual tasks. [_] To date, AI has not been implemented widely enough to make a noticeable difference to aggregate productivity statistics, but this is unsurprising \u2013 new innovations often take time to be integrated into production processes and fully utilised. The productivity effects of AI are likely to follow a standard J-curve, [_] where initial investment leads to aggregate productivity gains with a lag.\n\nWhat singles out AI from previous technological waves is the scale and speed of its potential impact. More than 50 per cent [_] of the US population used ChatGPT within 10 months of its launch \u2013 the internet took 17 years to reach the same level. Around 40 per cent of global employment is expected to be affected in one way or another by generative AI according to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) latest study. [_] AI should therefore be viewed as one of the few technologies with near-universal application, similar in scope to electricity or the internet. But unlike electricity, which took decades to integrate into production processes, much of the basic infrastructure for AI \u2013 computers and the internet \u2013 already exists, meaning AI\u2019s effects are likely to manifest within years, not decades.\n\nIt seems highly likely then that demand for labour will soon be disrupted on a substantial scale. Developed economies, white-collar workers and the services sector are most likely to feel the effects of this change in the short term, reflecting the alignment of their work to generative-AI technologies. However, this same group is also likely to be better able to navigate and leverage the disruptive impact of AI, given higher skill levels and technological readiness.\n\nSome of the commentary around automation views AI as a risk to human work. It is reasonable to consider this point of view \u2013 at this stage it is possible to make projections based only on analysis and it is not a given that AI will result in net job creation. What we can say is that the past 200 years suggest that new technologies tend to create more jobs in the long run than they destroy. It is true that this effect is not automatic and has not been as visible since the 1980s, a period characterised accelerating automation, [_] but with more limited productivity gains and a lower rate of new task creation \u2013a process known as \u201cso-so automation\u201d. Given the large potential productivity gains from AI, it seems unlikely it will follow that pattern \u2013 and the outcome of these processes are tractable, in that policy can affect the outcome.\n\nAI has the potential to increase long-term economic growth by boosting the quality of the labour force both by helping workers attain more skills and by living healthier lives. AI could improve skills by increasing educational attainment and providing tailored on-the-job training. It could improve health by enabling early and predictive diagnoses, expanding health-system capacity and increasing labour-market access for people with different abilities. However, these effects are not guaranteed and will require shrewd governmental policy to cultivate the potential gains.\n\nAI is already being used to improve labour-market efficiency by better matching workers with employers \u2013 similar to how online job boards improved hiring rates. [_] However, there is a risk that AI could also amplify existing biases in recruitment decisions. Policy guardrails will be important \u2013 including adding human checkpoints and evaluations of AI recruitment to ensure they work as intended.\n\nThe impact of AI on industrial relations will be complex. Workers already recognise the potential benefits of AI in terms of improving job quality \u2013 by automating routine tasks, improving physical safety at work and freeing up more time for more engaging tasks. However, workers also are wary of the risks \u2013 fearing job losses, loss of wage-bargaining power, increased intensity and stress, and additional management scrutiny. This suggests a significant role for policy in managing these disparate effects.\n\nAI and the UK\n\nThe AI revolution is unlikely to leave any part of the world unaffected. But in this report we focus on the UK. The country has a large economy, is well integrated with global markets, in possession of a skilled workforce, with strong capital markets and a competitive native tech scene \u2013 it should be well positioned to take advantage of technological innovations.\n\nThe UK also needs new means of making progress: the nation has endured a long period of slow productivity growth, feeding into disappointing overall economic performance. Successive efforts to address some of these shortcomings, based around infrastructure or skills, have made only limited impact. Something has been missing. At the same time, other countries are poised to surge ahead via technological transformation, leaving any unreformed economies less and less competitive.\n\nIn other words, the upside of AI for the UK is substantial, but the downside of a missed or mismanaged adoption of new technology is also significant.\n\nThe remainder of the report is structured in two chapters. In \u201cThe Potential Impact of AI on Labour Markets\u201d we analyse the ways in which AI could affect the world of work \u2013 exploring its potential impact on labour demand, labour supply and the workplace experience. Then in \u201cPolicy Solutions\u201d we provide a set of recommendations for the UK to best take advantage of the opportunities of AI and manage any resulting disruption.\n\nChapter 2\n\nT h e P o t e n t i a l I m p a c t o f A I o n L a b o u r M a r k e t s\n\nThere are three major ways in which AI might have an impact on the labour market.\n\nDemand for labour: Much of the debate about AI and the future of work has centred on the risk that AI will replace jobs through automation. Some jobs will certainly be replaced by AI, but it is only one of the ways that AI will affect labour demand. AI could also increase the demand for labour and create new jobs through two channels. First, AI could complement workers by making them more productive, which would increase economic growth and hence demand for workers. Second, AI could follow the pattern of previous technological waves and create new products, markets and sectors of the economy that require workers to perform new tasks and jobs \u2013 again increasing the demand for workers. The relative strength of these three forces, rather than just the first, will determine the net impact of AI on labour demand.\n\nSupply of labour: AI has the potential to increase the quantity, quality and effective deployment of labour. For example, AI-enabled education could raise educational attainment and productivity growth, while AI-assisted health care could lead to a larger and more economically active labour force. AI also has the potential to improve the functioning of the labour market by more efficiently matching employers with employees, reducing frictional unemployment and helping to reduce the under-utilisation of labour.\n\nWorkplace experience: AI has the potential to reshape the environment in which people work by automating repetitive tasks, increasing access to the workplace including for differently abled groups, and enabling better monitoring to safeguard against health-and-safety risks and to help boost productivity. This is not without risks, as any new technology can be used both for good and ill. But careful adoption of AI clearly has the potential to make work more engaging, inclusive and safer, and to make workers more productive.\n\nIn this section, we analyse each of these effects in turn \u2013 drawing on novel techniques to analyse the first two forces and a new AI-user survey to explore the potential impact of the latter.\n\nFigure 1 Channels through which AI might impact the labour market\n\nLabour Demand: How AI Will Change Jobs\n\nIn this section, we consider how AI might affect the world of work, both at the individual level, where workers will find that many of their existing tasks can be completed more efficiently using AI tools, and at the macro level, where this increased productivity will create some new jobs, displace others and boost GDP.[_]\n\nOverall, our analysis substantiates what might be expected intuitively about the potential of AI: it has enormous potential to improve productivity and in doing so support economic growth. Its impact will be felt broadly across the economy. There will be variations across sectors and professions, meaning that cost-saving benefits and disruptions will be felt differently in different areas. The size of businesses and their readiness will also play a key part.\n\nThe effect for workers might well be substantial. Long-established roles will change or in some circumstances start to dwindle. More people will need to look for new or different roles and many will need to address training and development needs. They will do so in an environment in which the technology will continue to develop, and possibly accelerate. The amount of churn in the labour market will therefore likely increase, with workers forced to change jobs more frequently and potentially move to different occupations and industries. The UK\u2019s labour-market infrastructure will therefore need to be upgraded to be able to deal with this change, and workers will need transferable skills or to be retrained in new skills to take advantage of the new opportunities on offer.\n\nThe Impact of AI on Individual Workers\n\nWithin this section we build on existing TBI analysis of the potential impact of AI on the public-sector workforce, using the same methodology to provide a necessarily speculative assessment of how various forms of AI might impact private-sector jobs in the future. As in our previous AI work, this paper builds upon approaches developed at the cutting edge of the current literature and utilises AI itself to help augment our own judgements to classify a large number of work tasks and estimating how likely they are to benefit from time savings with AI tools.[_]\n\nOur approach, detailed further in the technical annex, is grounded in the premise that technology will not replace entire jobs, but rather specific tasks within jobs. To explore this, we utilised the O*NET database of nearly 20,000 tasks associated with more than 900 occupations. To assess the ability of AI to perform each of these tasks, we began with a subset of around 200 tasks and used these to fine-tune a version of GPT-4 to give answers that closely matched both our own expert assessments and academic and empirical evidence regarding AI\u2019s current automation capabilities. This subset was then used to help improve our model through an iterative process that helped us to design a rubric of prompts that forced GPT-4 to consider various factors that might influence whether or not AI could perform a task, such as ethical considerations or the operating environment. Once trained on this subset we then used this model to analyse the entire set of tasks in the O*NET database, providing estimates of the amount of time that could be saved using AI and the type of AI most likely to be used to achieve these time savings. We then ran several robustness checks on the final outputs from the analysis to confirm that the time-savings figures being generated again corresponded with real world evidence and applications.\n\nFinally, we aggregated these task-level results to the occupation level, using weights that reflect the proportion of total work time spent on each task. These occupation-level data were then merged with UK Labour Force Survey data to estimate the potential time savings from AI across the UK labour force.\n\nThe results use a typology of five categories of AI tools that we developed to allow for clearer identification of the kinds and levels of investment that would be required to achieve these time savings.[_]\n\nThe first set of categories consist of AI-based software (in cost order):\n\nFree AI tools: These include products such as Google\u2019s Gemini, Microsoft\u2019s Bing search, ChatGPT and DALL-E, which primarily work by allowing users to access powerful LLMs to answer their prompts.\n\nLow-cost AI software tools: Virtual assistants (Microsoft Copilot, for example), payroll-management systems (the software group IRIS has recently integrated AI into its payroll and recruitment platforms) and scheduling assistants (examples include the services [_] Motion, Calendly and Clara) can streamline common work tasks.\n\nBespoke or internally trained AI systems: These include tools that would require training on proprietary data to unlock time savings. At McKinsey a chatbot named Lilli[_] has been trained on internal documents and data to help employees harness internal best-practice knowledge more effectively across the organisation. In retail, Walmart has launched a range of AI tools designed to boost efficiency across the business from route-optimisation software for its delivery drivers[_] to a conversational AI assistant[_] designed to help associates find products on the shop floor.\n\nThe second set of categories contains a range of different AI-enabled hardware:\n\nLow-cost sensory devices: Elements such as cameras, thermometers, speakers, microphones and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags combined with relatively basic AI with these devices \u2013 which allow speech to be recorded and directly transcribed, for the status and movement of equipment to be tracked more easily, and for visual inspections to be carried out remotely by AI \u2013 can unlock significant time savings. In the food industry, companies have begun to adopt AI-powered thermometers to monitor the temperature of ingredients while across industries the rollout of new AI transcription software has substantially sped up the process of note-taking and has unlocked new capabilities such as live captioning (offered by Verbit). [_]\n\nHigh-cost equipment and robotic AI: More costly, capital-intensive technologies such as medical scanners, surveillance systems and drones as well as advanced robots can harness AI to replace or aid humans in completing various physical tasks. These could be combined with AI to provide medical diagnoses, monitor environments or aid in the completion of other complex or dangerous tasks. Amazon has rolled out a range of AI-powered robots[_] across its warehouses, deploying more than 750,000 worldwide in efforts to automate physically demanding and repetitive tasks. In manufacturing, viAct[_] is using AI-powered surveillance systems to monitor various aspects of workplace safety and security more accurately and efficiently than humans. We find that many occupations could benefit at the margin from accessing these technologies, but given the high investment cost, this would not be economically viable unless the tools were being used intensively. In the analysis that follows, we therefore exclude any time savings from these technologies for occupations where the associated time saved is less than 10 per cent.\n\nOverall, we estimate that the full implementation of AI could lead to aggregate time savings across the whole economy worth up to 22.9 per cent of total workforce time (Figure 2). For the private sector, we estimate that around half of all tasks could be assisted by AI in some capacity but very few could be fully replaced, which implies 23.8 per cent of total private-sector time could be saved by AI. This proportion is slightly higher than our estimate of the amount of time that could be saved in the public sector, in part due to the greater prevalence of roles where the use of AI would not be ethically appropriate, for example in replacing judges or the large number of caring roles within the health sector.[_]\n\nFigure 2 Potential time savings from deploying AI across the UK economy and within the public and private sectors Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nOur results suggest that most time is saved through AI-enabled software rather than more costly robotics or other high-cost equipment. This suggests that overall productivity gains are likely to be sizeable since expensive labour can be replaced with cheaper forms of capital without the need for costly investments in hardware.\n\nThe amount of time that AI could save varies significantly across occupations. Figure 3 shows the estimated time saving from full deployment of AI across the more than 900 different occupations contained with the O*NET database. Drawing a few examples from the data we find that negligible time could be saved by motorcycle mechanics as their roles involve undertaking complex physical tasks often in uncontrolled or changing environments.[_] At the other end of the scale, we estimate that AI could save telemarketers nearly 60 per cent of their time because of its ability to automate routine cognitive tasks.\n\nFigure 3 The range of potential time savings from deploying AI for more than 900 different occupations Source: TBI analysis using O*NET data\n\nAlthough the exact time-savings figure for each occupation is interesting, presented alone they are less useful for understanding the job characteristics that determine the potential impact of AI. To help understand the kinds of people and jobs most likely to be impacted by AI we also present time savings by occupational, sectoral, regional, age, educational-attainment and gender groups in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 Potential time savings from deploying AI split by worker characteristics Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nOccupational groups: The current capabilities of AI mean that occupations involving a significant amount of routine cognitive tasks are particularly exposed \u2013 this is why we see the largest potential time savings for those in administrative and sales occupations (46 per cent and 33.4 per cent, respectively). Our estimates suggest AI could save more than one-quarter of time in professional occupations, with slightly less time saved for those in more senior roles, which also require more complex, bespoke AI software. For occupations involving a greater share of manual physical tasks, the predicted time savings from AI are much lower, with those in skilled trades predicted to be the least exposed to AI-driven time savings. These trends reflect the relatively limited ability of AI to automate complex physical tasks in a cost-effective way.\n\nSectoral groups: Workers in banking and finance are particularly exposed to time savings from AI with an estimated potential for nearly 30 per cent time savings. This is likely because these are data-driven industries with high potential to train and use bespoke AI systems to automate or assist with a range of more routine cognitive tasks. This contrasts with construction, where total AI time savings are predicted to amount to only 16 per cent of working time due to the complex nature of many of the manual tasks involved in construction roles. Our results reflect the differential capabilities of AI in performing manual tasks with estimated time savings within the manufacturing sector, where manual tasks are more likely to be routine and occur in stable work environments, estimated to be much higher. Nearly one-quarter of manufacturing workers\u2019 time could potentially be saved by AI, including nearly 3 per cent through AI-enabled equipment and robotics.\n\nRegions: Our results suggest that regional variation in AI exposure is relatively limited, reflecting the fact that UK regions tend to have diversified economies with a range of sectors and occupational groups. That said, the impact of AI is estimated to be more significant in areas of the UK where service sectors are most dominant, predominantly London, the South East and East of England. Wales is predicted to be the part of the UK that is least affected by the introduction of AI, reflecting the relatively high proportion of private-sector workers in manufacturing (more than 13 per cent versus less than 4 per cent in London) and in construction (10 per cent versus 7 per cent in London) where time savings from AI are predicted to be relatively low. [_]\n\nAge groups : Across age groups, differences in levels of exposure to AI are relatively limited. Those aged 16 to 19 are least exposed to AI, as this group is more likely to be employed in lower skilled manual work, which is less susceptible to AI replacement. Thereafter, AI exposure levels increase with age until peaking at 25.2 per cent for those aged 30 to 34. This pattern partly reflects the changing nature of the labour force, with workers of these ages more likely to be highly educated and working in cognitive roles than workers in older cohorts. The widespread impact of AI across age groups suggests that adult training and reskilling will need to become a broader feature of the labour market in the future to ensure resilience against potential technological unemployment. Older people are projected to be slightly less exposed to AI than middle-aged workers. However, given concerns that these workers may find it more difficult to adapt to new technologies this may in practice mean that targeted responses around training and skills are necessary.\n\nEducational-attainment groups: Our results suggest that differences in exposure by education level are perhaps the starkest of all our groupings, with highly educated workers much more exposed to AI than those with lower or no qualifications. These differences reflect a reversal in the historic trend of tech disruption, where lower- and middle-skilled jobs have tended to be more impacted by automation. AI technologies are estimated to have a much greater impact on the predominantly cognitive roles undertaken by those with higher education levels. The economist David Autor has previously noted the potential for AI to act as a social leveller. [_]\n\nGender: Our analysis suggests some differences in AI exposure by gender, with women employed in private-sector roles exposed to roughly 3 per cent more time savings from AI than men. These differences seem to be primarily driven by men significantly outnumbering women in more manual professions that are less exposed to AI, with men outnumbering women by six to one in private-sector construction jobs and by more than two to one in manufacturing and transport.[_] By contrast, differences in employment within highly exposed occupational categories are more limited, with roughly similar numbers of men and women categorised as working within administrative and support services. However, in the public sector, women are less exposed to AI than men because they account for a higher share of employment in occupations such as education, health and social work that have more limited exposure to AI.\n\nThe Macroeconomic Impact of AI on Labour Demand\n\nThere are several ways in which the time savings from AI could affect the wider economy:\n\nJob displacement: Headlines about AI and the workplace tend to focus on the number of jobs technology might replace. A reduction in the time it takes to perform tasks at a cost-effective, satisfactory standard is likely to lead to a reduction in the number of workers required at some firms to produce the same output. Some firms may therefore choose to bank these time and productivity savings and to reduce the size of their workforce.\n\nRetention of more productive workers: AI also makes workers more productive, which makes them more valuable to employers. Some firms will therefore choose to retain their workforce or redeploy displaced workers to enable them to grow their business more quickly. The choice of whether firms choose to shed their workers or retain them is not predetermined and will have a key bearing on how AI will affect the labour market.\n\nHigher economic growth and higher demand for labour: AI is likely to boost economic growth and hence demand for labour through two channels: Higher productivity: If AI is relatively cheap to implement and leads to significant cost savings it should mean that the price of some goods and services in the economy will decline. At the same time, if AI makes workers more productive, they will tend to be paid more. These two effects \u2013 lower prices and higher wages \u2013 should increase aggregate demand in the economy, which will also boost demand for labour and lead to some displaced workers being re-employed. Faster innovation and new jobs: Periods of rapid technological progress are often associated with new products, sectors and markets being created that result in new tasks for workers to do. Historically, the growth of new tasks has tended to lag increases in labour productivity, but in the long run this effect has tended to balance out any impact from technological unemployment. Therefore, a key question in judging the impact of AI on labour demand is the lag between the adoption of AI that causes labour shedding and new tasks and jobs being created that bring displaced workers back into work.\n\n\n\nThe overall impact of AI on the labour market will therefore depend on a range of factors, including how quickly AI is adopted by firms, the extent of productivity benefits that are realised whether firms choose to shed labour or retain their workforce, and how much and how quickly AI boosts demand for labour through higher output and task creation.\n\nSince the strength of each of these effects is uncertain, we explore the potential impact of AI on the labour market through four illustrative scenarios. A full description of the methodology and rationale behind the assumptions used in these scenarios can be found in the technical annex.\n\nFigure 5 Descriptions of labour-demand scenarios\n\nScenario 1: Tailwind\n\nIn our first scenario, which we view as most likely, AI is adopted quickly across the economy with 10 per cent of UK firms making effective use of the technology by the early 2030s and 90 per cent by 2050. This relatively quick uptake is partly enabled by permissive government policy designed to enable AI tools to be deployed quickly but in a considered way to manage the risk of unfettered adoption creating a backlash against the technology. This pace of adoption is a little faster than the last general-purpose technology \u2013 the internet \u2013 on the grounds that much of the enabling digital infrastructure for firms to deploy software-based AI already exists and because uptake of new technologies has been speeding up over time. As with previous technological waves, the pace of adoption is assumed to vary depending on firm size and the cost of the technology involved.\n\nLarger firms (those with more than 500 employees) lead the way in adopting AI in this scenario, as they have the resources to experiment, hone and invest in the technology to make earliest productive use of it.[_] We assume these firms adopt different types of AI at slightly different rates, with uptake of free AI tools happening earliest given their minimal cost, followed by investment in subscription software and low-cost AI-enabled hardware, and then a slightly slower uptake of more costly bespoke AI software and high-cost AI-enabled hardware given the time and investment needed to develop those technologies. Aggregating across AI technology types, the \u201ctailwind\u201d scenario sees 10 per cent of large firms deploy AI effectively by 2030 and 90 per cent by the early 2040s.\n\nFigure 6 Timeline for achieving time savings to be achieved in the tailwind scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nSmaller firms also reap the rewards from AI fairly quickly in this scenario, albeit lagging behind larger firms by a few years, with 10 per cent of small firms deploying AI effectively by the mid-2030s and close to 90 per cent by 2050. The biggest delays in adoption among small firms relate to bespoke AI software and high-cost AI enabled equipment as it takes time for these technologies to be \u201cplatformised\u201d (that is, for specialist AI firms to develop tools that can be easily implemented across an industry rather than each firm having to develop its own tool), and 90 per cent rollout of these tools would not be realised until the late 2050s.\n\nIn this scenario there is relatively little labour-market disruption because firms retain most workers that are exposed to AI to either expand output or develop new products and services made possible by AI. Only one-quarter of time savings result in labour shedding, which is in line with other studies that have examined the labour-market impacts of AI[_] and firms\u2019 historical responses to falling demand for their products during recessions.[_] This implies that nearly 1.5 million workers lose their jobs as a result of AI, but crucially these redundancies do not occur all at once. Rather, they occur gradually in line with the pace that AI is rolled out across the economy. As the pace of rollout is at its fastest around 2040, this is the time when the peak impact occurs, with close to 100,000 additional redundancies occurring each year in this period. To put that figure in context, there are nearly 25 million private-sector workers and there have been an average of 450,000 redundancies each year over the past decade, so even at AI\u2019s peak of disruption, the risk of redundancy increases by scarcely one-fifth above its baseline level.[_]\n\nMoreover, these displaced workers are expected to be reabsorbed into the labour force relatively quickly. Higher productivity raises worker incomes, which leads to higher economic growth and higher demand for labour.[_] Meanwhile, AI accelerates the development of new products and services for which more workers are required. In past waves of technological improvement the pace of new task creation has occurred with a lag of around ten years, but given the progressively faster rollout of general-purpose technologies over time, we assume this would occur within five years in this scenario.\n\nOverall, the net impact of AI on unemployment is relatively modest in the tailwind scenario \u2013 with a peak increase of 340,000 in 2040 that is fully unwound over the following five years (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7 The impact of AI on unemployment in a tailwind scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nIn this scenario, AI is relatively cheap to deploy, resulting in average cost savings of around 70 per cent compared with the equivalent cost of labour (with larger savings for free AI tools, subscription-based AI software and low-cost AI-enabled hardware, and lower savings for bespoke AI systems and high-cost AI-enabled equipment). These time and cost savings lead to a significant boost to productivity, which increases by 8 per cent. Higher productivity also spurs greater business investment, leading to a higher capital stock and a further 3 per cent boost to GDP. Overall, then, GDP is around 11 per cent larger by the middle of the century and annual GDP growth is boosted significantly over the next two decades, with a peak impact of around 0.7 percentage points per year during the late 2030s \u2013 a significant boost to the meagre 1.2 per cent growth rate the UK has averaged since 2007.[_]\n\nFigure 8 The impact of AI on GDP in the tailwind scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nScenario 2: Jet Stream\n\nIn our most optimistic scenario \u2013 \u201cjet stream\u201d \u2013 the world\u2019s leading tech firms double down on their existing investments in AI and compute capacity, leading to lower cost, and more efficient and accurate AI tools being developed that assuage doubters and spur rapid uptake of AI \u2013 even faster than in the tailwind scenario. This is partly enabled by supportive government policy including early adoption of AI in the public sector, which acts to demonstrate its value to firms in the wider economy.\n\nLarge firms again lead the way in making effective use of AI tools, with 10 per cent of them doing so by 2030. Such is the competitive advantage that AI bestows on early adopters that other companies quickly follow suit, with 90 per cent of large firms making effective use of the technology before the end of the 2030s and almost total rollout achieved by the mid-2040s (Figure 9. As in all our scenarios, small firms are slightly slower to adopt the technology, but in the jet-stream scenario the lag between large and small firms is shortened thanks to the rapid platformisation of bespoke AI software tools and complex AI-enabled hardware. As a result, 90 per cent of small firms are making effective use of the technology by the mid-2040s with close to full adoption by the middle of the century.\n\nFigure 9 Timeline for time savings to be achieved in the jet-stream scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nDespite the rapid pace of AI uptake, this scenario results in a benign impact on the labour market. As in the tailwind scenario, a total of 1.5 million jobs are displaced in aggregate, but these redundancies are spread out over several years, with a peak of 137,000 redundancies per year in the mid-2030s. However, in this scenario, rapid adoption of AI also spurs greater competition and innovation, which leads to the rapid creation of new products, markets and sectors that create new tasks for displaced workers to do. Unlike in the tailwind scenario \u2013 where the lag between AI adoption and new task creation is five years \u2013 in this scenario the lag is just three years, reflecting the more innovative environment. As a result, strong re-employment effects quickly limit the cumulative rise in technological unemployment, with unemployment peaking at 290,000 in 2035 before rapidly falling (Figure 10).\n\nFigure 10 The impact of AI on unemployment in the jet-stream scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nThe lower cost of deploying AI in this scenario and faster rate of deployment leads to a decade of very strong growth, with GDP nearly 14 per cent higher by the middle of the century than a scenario without AI-enabled growth. Moreover, annual GDP growth is around 1 percentage point higher on average through the 2030s (Figure 11). These growth impacts may seem large, but they are broadly in line with projections from Goldman Sachs[_] and the IMF,[_] which both predict AI could add up to 1.5 percentage points to annual growth rates for a decade and raise GDP by up to 16 per cent in aggregate.\n\nFigure 11 The impact of AI on GDP in the jet-stream scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nScenario 3: Whirlwind\n\nIn our disruptive \u201cwhirlwind\u201d scenario, the productivity gains from AI and the pace of rollout mimic the rapid rate seen in the jet-stream scenario (see Figure 9) but in this case the impact on the labour market is much more marked.\n\nIn this scenario, there is a significant, 10-year lag between AI being adopted and new tasks being created, which means it takes far longer for displaced workers to be re-employed. This lag matches past waves of technological disruption, either reflecting a natural lag between the development of new products and those products being sold en masse or reflecting overly restrictive or inefficient regulation that delays products coming to market and hence delays the re-employment effect.\n\nIn this scenario, productivity gains are as large as in the jet-stream scenario, so firms are still keen to exploit the gains from AI rapidly, but because there is less of an immediate need to redeploy labour to perform new tasks, firms opt to shed a much higher share of their workforce exposed to AI. In aggregate, this results in 3 million jobs being displaced, albeit with the effect spread out over many years. Annual redundancies peak at 274,000 in the mid-2030s, which adds materially to unemployment during the 2030s. Unemployment is more than 1 million higher by 2035 with a peak impact of 1.5 million around 2040, before re-employment effects kick in. The 2030s would thus be characterised by rising unemployment, while the 2040s would see this effect quickly unwound (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 12 The impact of AI on unemployment in the whirlwind scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nAs in the jet-stream scenario, AI boosts GDP by 14 per cent by 2050 in the whirlwind scenario, but the pattern of growth is less smooth on account of the disruption in the labour market. There is a twin-peak-shaped trend in annual growth rates, with an initial burst coming from the initial adoption of AI in the 2030s followed by another period of higher growth in the 2040s when new task creation kicks in, leading to displaced workers being re-employed and unemployment falling back to its natural rate (Figure 13).\n\nFigure 13 The impact of AI on GDP in the whirlwind scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nScenario 4: Breeze\n\nIn our underwhelming \u201cbreeze\u201d scenario, the gains from AI are much more limited and take longer to materialise. In this scenario, uncertainty over the effectiveness of AI and fears of a hype cycle deter potential early adopters from rolling out the technology and policy fails to provide a boost, with regulatory barriers hindering uptake.\n\nIn this scenario, the cost of rolling out AI is higher than in other scenarios, partly because of the slow pace of uptake (which limits the pace at which costs fall) and partly because some early investments in AI fail to bear fruit. Ultimately, it proves impossible for platformisation to make it cost-effective for smaller firms to adopt bespoke AI technology that requires training on proprietary data and high-cost equipment enabled by AI. This reduces the aggregate time savings across the private sector from 23.8 per cent of workers\u2019 time to 15.8 per cent.[_] Adoption of AI technologies is persistently much lower than in our other scenarios, with adoption only just breaching 50 per cent by 2050 (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 14 Timeline for time savings from AI to be achieved in the breeze scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data Note: The figures in this chart show the level of AI adoption compared to the potential economy-wide time savings of 23.8 per cent referenced in all other scenarios. Since AI adoption in the breeze scenario is only partial for small firms due to the failure of platformisation to deliver cost-effective bespoke AI software and high-cost AI-enabled hardware, the small-firm-adoption line reaches a maximum adoption level of only 60 per cent in the second half of the 21st century.\n\nIn the breeze scenario the higher cost of AI, slower pace of rollout and partial rate of adoption all result in a much more limited impact on economic growth. By 2035, AI increases GDP by only around 0.6 percent, which is closely aligned with the more pessimistic predictions of Acemoglu.[_] After 2035, AI adoption begins to accelerate, which boosts growth by 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points a year between then and 2050 and leaves GDP around 5 per cent higher by the middle of the century (Figure 15). This is a non-trivial effect but occurs much later than in other scenarios.\n\nFigure 15 The impact of AI on GDP in the breeze scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nGiven the more limited productivity gains from AI in this scenario, fewer workers are displaced by the technology, with 800,000 redundancies spread over several decades. The slow pace of AI adoption means that annual redundancies from AI are manageably low and far in the future, peaking at around 60,000 a year in the mid-2040s. However, in this scenario \u2013 as in the whirlwind scenario \u2013 there is a delay of 10 years between AI adoption and new tasks being created, so it takes time for displaced workers to return to the labour market. As a result, the increase in unemployment in this scenario is more persistent, peaking at 400,000 in the late 2040s before falling only gradually thereafter (Figure 16).\n\nFigure 16 The impact of AI on unemployment in the breeze scenario Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nSummary\n\nThese four scenarios illustrate the uncertainty that remains about the impact of AI on the economy and the labour market. The impact on GDP by 2050 could range from 5 to 14 per cent (Figure 17) and unemployment could rise by as little as 290,000 or by as much as 1.5 million (Figure 18).\n\nFigure 17 The cumulative impact of AI on GDP across all four scenarios Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nFigure 18 The impact of AI on unemployment across all four scenarios Source: TBI analysis using LFS and O*NET data\n\nIn all our scenarios, off-the-shelf AI software solutions are implemented sooner and more quickly than those that require bespoke training on proprietary data or high-cost equipment. Disruption is therefore likely to be most quickly felt by those in administrative and sales professions where these tools can achieve the greatest time savings, whereas those in managerial and professional occupations for whom bespoke AI tools achieve the greatest time savings are likely to only see disruption occur later. Since these professions are dominated by women, this also implies that women are on average likely to experience labour-market disruption earlier than men.\n\nThere is considerable uncertainty over when the impact of AI will first show up in macroeconomic statistics. Predicting the lift-off point of a technological s-curve is inherently difficult, but in all our scenarios the impact on the economy is relatively modest in the near term, raising GDP by between 0.1 and 1 per cent over the next five years and the level of unemployment by up to 180,000 by 2030. This means the current government has an important window during this parliament to put in place the plans needed to steer AI to its most productive use.\n\nThe tailwind scenario represents our best guess as to the likely impact of AI given our current state of knowledge. In this case, AI would raise GDP by less than 0.5 per cent by 2030, around 2 per cent by 2035 and a substantial 11 per cent by 2050. This scenario would also produce only a moderate degree of labour-market disruption, with unemployment rising by around 30,000 by 2030 and 340,000 at its peak in 2040 before quickly subsiding. This relatively benign scenario relies on several key assumptions: i) all the theoretical gains from AI become economically viable to implement in practice, ii) some of these gains take 20 years to materialise as a process of platformisation is required for advanced AI technology to become economically viable for small firms, and iii) AI generates new products and services that require workers to produce in relatively short order. As we have seen, adjustments to each of these elements lead to quite a different story.\n\nIf, as in our breeze scenario, AI falls short of our current estimation of its potential capabilities and cannot be economically implemented in some instances, its impact on the economy will be far smaller, with only a modest boost to annual GDP growth over several decades. Equally, if \u2013 as in the jet-stream scenario \u2013 the gains from AI are larger than we currently imagine and firms are keen to exploit it even more quickly, the 2030s could be a decade of very strong economic growth for the UK.\n\nHowever, there is a risk that if AI creates a significant GDP boost, it does so by replacing workers in their current roles without generating new tasks for workers to perform until much later. This is demonstrated in our whirlwind scenario where the unemployment level doubles from its current rate of 1.4 million to almost 3 million by 2040 \u2013 a level we have not seen since the recession of the early 1990s. However, we do not consider this scenario particularly likely as it relies on AI being very good at replacing workers in their current jobs but not creating any new products or services. Nevertheless, policymakers should bear this risk in mind when considering how to respond to the impact that AI will have on the labour market.\n\nIndeed, what comes next and which of these scenarios turns out to be closest to the emerging reality will not only depend on the fundamental capabilities of or the decisions made by private-sector firms, but also on decisions made by policymakers themselves. Regulatory decisions could accelerate the rollout of AI, inhibit its adoption or even lead to a backlash against the technology that ultimately delays its rollout if it is implemented prematurely in key sectors. In the chapter on policy solutions below we discuss a range of no-regrets policies the government should pursue to help manage these effects.\n\nLabour Supply: How AI Can Improve the Quality, Quantity and Effective Use of Workers\n\nOne of the vital but less explored elements of understanding AI\u2019s impact on the labour market is its potential to improve labour supply, including through deploying AI in the public sector to improve public-service provision. In this section we highlight how AI could improve: the quality of labour by improving the UK\u2019s educational offer; the quantity of labour by improving health care; and the effective use of labour through better job matching.\n\nAI-Enabled Education\n\nEducation is ripe for its own technological revolution. Deploying AI in the classroom could significantly improve students\u2019 education attainment, raise the productivity of the UK\u2019s future workforce and add to economic growth. AI could boost students\u2019 educational attainment in at least three ways:\n\nIt could enhance the quality of teaching through AI co-pilots for teachers, which could help with lesson planning, student assessment and data analysis. For example, AI-powered platforms for schools, such as CENTURY, already analyse student data to help teachers address student weaknesses in a more targeted way. [_]\n\nIt could free up teacher time to focus on more interactive learning by automating repetitive tasks such as grading assignments and tracking attendance. In schools that use edtech, teachers are already beginning to use AI algorithms to grade students\u2019 work faster. [_]\n\nIt could increase students\u2019 ability to absorb lesson content through AI tutor bots, which could tailor personalised content and provide real-time feedback. AI edtech startups have been at the forefront of building chatbot-style learning in which an AI tutor imitates a human teacher. It prompts questions, provides on-demand support and gives instant formative assessments. Some edtech developers have created and integrated AI speech recognition for tutoring students in their edtech tools.[_]\n\nSince AI learning tools remain relatively new, there is a dearth of in-depth academic studies and long-running, large-scale pilot programmes to quantify their potential impact on learners and the wider economy. TBI has endeavoured to begin to bridge this evidential gap in the paper The Economic Case for AI-Enabled Education.\n\nOur analysis suggests AI could boost educational attainment levels by around 6 per cent on average over their academic career through a combination of improved attainment of individual students and by enabling more students to progress to higher levels of education. Importantly, the benefits from AI tend to be bigger for lower-performing students, suggesting that AI-enabled education could help improve equality of opportunity in the UK.\n\nBy boosting the productivity of the future workforce, we estimate AI-enabled education could raise GDP by around 6 per cent in the long run and add more than 0.1 per cent to growth per year for more than 40 years (Figure 19).\n\nFigure 19 The impact of AI-enabled education on UK GDP Source: TBI analysis (2024) using ONS population statistics and UK LFS\n\nClearly these changes will not emerge overnight. The full effect of AI-enabled education will emerge with a considerable lag because of the time it will take to instal the technology in the nation\u2019s 26,500 schools, along with the requisite training and support for teachers to make the most of it. Employee engagement, including through teaching unions, will be an important part of the story; managing the transition will be a complex project, but one we believe teachers can be fully involved in, and that many will welcome.\n\nBeyond the initial implementation phase there will naturally be a period in which students work through the system and then begin to filter into the workforce. It will be a multi-generational process for the whole workforce to consist of those who have experienced the benefits of AI-enabled education.\n\nThe above figures are based on an assessment of AI\u2019s capabilities as they are today, but the technology is not static. If instead we assume the technology continues to improve so that it raises educational attainment by 10 per cent (versus 6 per cent in the base case) then AI could boost GDP by a further 4 per cent in the long term. This upside scenario is by no means implausible and highlights both the upside potential of investing in AI-enabled education now and the importance of designing the programme in a way that it can continually incorporate improvements in AI over time.\n\nAI-Enabled Health Care\n\nOne challenge for policymakers looking to boost economic performance is that as the workforce ages and as the incidence of preventable diseases such as obesity continues to rise, the number of days of work lost to ill health increases. This reduces the quantity of labour available and diverts scarce public funds to higher health and welfare costs, which slows growth.\n\nA comprehensive set of policies for the AI era should consider the new opportunities AI offers to support a healthy workforce and help manage health at a workplace level. A full examination of the potential for AI to support this effort is beyond the scope of this paper,[_] but in brief, there are several areas where AI has strong potential to improve the health of the workforce, extend longevity of workers, and reduce the burden on state support and health-care systems:\n\nAI could help accelerate the pace of medical research, leading to faster discovery of novel treatments at lower cost. For example, the leap in knowledge made by DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold team \u2013 ushering in a 10,000-fold increase in coverage of protein structures for researchers to study and build on [_] \u2013 has completely transformed early-stage biological research and sparked an AI renaissance in modelling biological systems, with real-world implications for medicine and biotech.\n\nAI-enabled diagnostics can help identify those at higher risk of disease, allowing earlier intervention, more targeted treatments and ultimately better outcomes. For example, the TRICORDER programme, an AI-enabled smart stethoscope that is being trialled in 100 GP clinics in the UK, can immediately diagnose heart failure with more than 90 per cent accuracy and much more quickly than a conventional blood test. It could save the health system \u00a32,400 per heart-failure patient by eliminating the need for a visit to an accident and emergency department. [_]\n\nAI could improve the efficiency and capacity of the health service. For example, Faculty\u2019s Frontier AI tool has been deployed in four hospitals in Wales to accurately predict when patients will be ready to leave hospital, helping to speed up discharges and save up to 3,000 bed days a year. [_] Similarly, the Somerset NHS Foundation Trust built a digital virtual assistant to manage patient appointments and automate workflows, which saved staff 24 hours of time every week over a six-month period. [_]\n\nAI-enabled prosthetics and other assistive technologies can support those with disabilities or short-term health conditions to re-enter the workplace. For example, researchers at Newcastle University have developed a robotic hand with a small camera that uses AI to analyse images as they come into view and respond automatically.[_]\n\nThe macroeconomic impact of these medical advances could be significant. Recent analysis commissioned by TBI highlighted how a 20 per cent reduction in the incidence of six long-term conditions could provide a permanent uplift of 1 per cent to the UK\u2019s GDP within a decade and result in more than 400,000 more people in work[_] (see Prosperity Through Health: The Macroeconomic Case for Investing in Preventative Health Care in the UK). AI has the potential to help deliver these gains, including by enabling better screening to detect preventable conditions, fuelling medical research to develop novel treatments to manage them and improving patient access to them.\n\nAI-Enabled Job Matching\n\nAI systems can reduce both unemployment and under-employment by better matching workers with jobs that utilise their skillset. We have seen this effect before in previous waves of digital technology. For example, the use of online recruitment in Norway led to 9 per cent shorter vacancy times, 13 per cent fewer unsuccessful hiring attempts, increased job-finding rates for unemployed workers, 6 per cent higher starting wages for previously unemployed workers, and a reduction in steady-state unemployment by one-seventh. Another study from the US found that online job search reduced unemployment durations by 25 per cent.[_]\n\nAI could double down on the gains made through the internet. One of the main drivers of improved matching in Norway was better search technology \u2013 and there is ample evidence that greater machine learning is already being built into commonly used job-search tools. AI-driven personalised job recommendations can reduce traditional job-search frictions for both recruiters and candidates.\n\nTo get a sense of the importance of this effect, we ran a simple simulation in which AI-powered job matching reduces the length of unemployment spells in the UK by a conservative estimate of 10 per cent. This would help both reduce frictional short-term unemployment and the risk of longer-term unemployment. The latter is particularly damaging from an economic point of view as the longer an individual is unemployed the less likely they are to re-enter the workforce. Overall, our scenario suggests that AI-enabled job matching could raise employment by 0.4 per cent, equivalent to around 130,000 more people in work.[_]\n\nThis conventional form of job matching is not the only way that AI could support worker placement. As part of our work, we also conducted a small study of early AI adopters to explore other areas where workers needed more recruitment and job-matching support.[_] Workers in our survey flagged the need for more assistance with job transitions, including: predictive tools that notify them if their job was likely to be at risk or if other opportunities become available that better match their skills; advice on how their skills could be redeployed in other roles; and advice on what types of training may make them more competitive in the labour market. They were especially keen to access free tools that help with CV writing, interview preparation and identifying relevant opportunities \u2013 all functions that AI could help deliver.\n\nAI also has the potential to streamline and improve the recruitment process from an employer\u2019s perspective by helping to screen applicants or automate parts of the process. There is even potential for AI to help correct some of the flaws inherent in human-led systems, including recruitment biases. However, AI-enabled recruitment systems need to be very carefully designed because failure to anticipate negative effects may exacerbate the very biases that they are trying to overcome. Indeed, one study found that Facebook ads for supermarket cashier positions were shown to an audience of 85 per cent women and taxi jobs to an audience of 75 per cent black people.[_] There is also a risk that AI tools could screen out candidates who require accommodations for different abilities[_] or employ personality tests that may filter out candidates with depression or anxiety. The same tools could also make decisions based on a candidate\u2019s likelihood of accepting an offered salary based on markers. This could further lock in historically inequitable pay.\n\nSome of these concerns can be avoided through careful system design, and there are examples of AI tools enhancing recruiters\u2019 work without major issues. For example, IBM launched a suite of tools as long ago as 2018 that uses AI to automate human resources, including job matches from candidate history, leading to enhanced conversion and greater net promoter scores. But all these tools require careful monitoring \u2013 ideally using diverse teams \u2013 and guardrails that might need to be adjusted from time to time. Our AI-user survey indicated that HR representatives used human oversight of automated recruitment tools as a check for bias and inaccuracies. According to one HR analyst, \u201cWhile there are efficiencies with saving time, it does mean that I have to spend time proofreading.\u201d Another HR worker acknowledged the need to train their team to spot inaccuracies in AI outputs.\n\nHow AI Could Change the Workplace Experience\n\nAs with previous forms of technology, AI has a multi-faceted effect on workers\u2019 relationships with their employers and management. As part of our AI-user survey, we explored workers\u2019 experiences, hopes and concerns around the introduction of AI tools. Our view is that, overall, the effect should be positive for employment relations, but there are sensitivities that might need to be addressed, primarily at an individual workplace level but potentially through national policy as well.\n\nFirst, AI can perform mundane and repetitive tasks like data entry to free up worker time and increase their share of intellectually stimulating tasks. In turn, this can increase job satisfaction, autonomy and engagement as workers perform more diverse tasks and, potentially, contribute to more strategic decision-making. For example, a UK financial-services firm[_] used an AI-powered chatbot to handle basic customer queries, increasing the variety and complexity of questions that human agents fielded. Our AI-user survey, conducted in the UK, found evidence that managers tended to turn to AI tools to help cope with an overwhelming backlog of work. Blue-collar workers were also able to spend less time and effort on manual tasks, leading to increased job satisfaction.\n\nHowever, moving to this more productive mode requires an adjustment for those who find comfort in mundane tasks, or have concerns around increased monitoring. One blue-collar worker in our survey stated, \u201cIf the work you usually do is done more efficiently than when you do it, then you feel useless, you can\u2019t keep up the rate.\u201d In the same UK financial-services firm described above, the customer-service chatbot functioned by monitoring human agents, which led to fears of this data being used to determine pay and performance.\n\nSecond, AI can augment workers\u2019 capabilities and increase access to work for differently abled workers and other marginalised groups. This could reduce inequality by ensuring a more meritocratic division of opportunities. Our AI-user survey indicated that workers tend to look at AI as an opportunity to upskill and improve job security and advancement. A fulfilment-centre supervisor who worked in the retail industry said that automated robots displaced some roles but overall led him to learn new technological skills and enjoy his job much more because, \u201cI feel more valued; before \u2026 I felt that I was the robot.\u201d AI tools also enable differently abled workers to gain access to workplaces that may otherwise have been inaccessible. For example, tools like Zammo,[_] a conversational software platform, improve accessibility to interfaces like online job boards through providing a voice interface, for instance, helping firms build a more neurodiverse workforce.\n\nMaximising these opportunities relies on equitable distribution of AI itself. Successive waves of digitisation and modernisation have shown that smaller firms can often be in the long tail of slower tech adoption, and there is already some evidence of this with respect to AI; a Gartner poll[_] of executives indicated that large firms are likely to be among the earliest adopters and largest investors in advanced-AI capabilities. At company level, this means that the benefits of AI tools should not be restricted to management but should be equitably distributed across the workforce. Our AI-user survey suggested managers might in fact welcome this bottom-up experimentation.\n\nThird, AI can improve supervisory capabilities by increasing managerial capacity to perform oversight. Quality of management has long been recognised as a challenge in driving UK productivity growth, and new tools applied well can assist managers in assessing performance and intervening where necessary to support teams that need it. At the same time, AI tools can improve workplace health and safety, especially for roles that are exposed to danger, such as physical labour.\n\nThere are two key channels[_] for this. The first is preventative, whereby smart equipment and personalised wearables can be used to assess threats to workers in real time \u2013 for example by monitoring surroundings for hazardous conditions like radiation exposure, or by replacing human workers performing dangerous tasks. For example, a Canadian manufacturer[_] used AI to allow workers to remotely operate a metal-cutting machine, which reduced worker injuries. Firms are also commissioning tools like Sleepio,[_] an AI training programme that has been proven to improve sleep and mental health.\n\nThe second channel is remedial, whereby AI is used to respond to, address and investigate workplace lapses. Smart drones can assist in search-and-rescue operations in difficult terrain like mines; smart glasses may use computer vision to provide response suggestions; and digital accident data concerning the location and nature of incidents can help improve future response times.\n\nInevitably, managers will need to exercise sensitivity around introducing additional oversight. A steel labourer who worked in construction said in our AI-user survey, \u201cWith more drones around the sites, I feel monitored, like I can\u2019t take as many breaks, and the environment is less comfortable.\u201d To avoid ill sentiment, managers will need to communicate their workplace policies and the guardrails around them in order to not undermine the benefits through a general sense of surveillance.\n\nOverall, this evidence indicates that AI tools can be used \u2013 and indeed are already being used \u2013 to improve the workplace experience, and that the benefits can be maximised if firms take steps to manage deployment carefully. Our AI-user survey indicated that offering training can overcome resistance from workers who are sceptical of or unfamiliar with the technology. Sharing best practices between teams and engaging workers in the testing, training and adoption process is key to successful AI transitions.\n\nAgain, few of these developments are entirely new. Many represent a continuation or development of trends that have been building for many years. As with previous technological developments, AI deployment may need additional safeguards, like manual checks, in highly regulated sectors such as legal services, or applications with ethical implications like recruitment screening. If successfully managed, there is significant upside to the workplace experience.\n\nChapter 3\n\nP o l i c y S o l u t i o n s\n\nBased on the above analysis, we have developed a set of \u201cno-regrets\u201d policies that government should focus on to maximise the benefits of AI in the workforce for the broadest possible part of society. These are grouped into four broad themes:\n\nA. Encourage broad AI adoption to help equalise opportunity.\n\nB. Upgrade the UK\u2019s labour-market infrastructure to help workers deal with the more dynamic pace of change that AI is likely to create.\n\nC. Harness the ability of AI to improve job quality by shining a light on how AI is being adopted across the economy.\n\nD. Engage in thoughtful scenario analysis and contingency planning to prepare for a more radical future that AI could create.\n\nThe next section expands on each of these four themes, with specific policy recommendations:\n\nA) Encouraging Broad Adoption of AI So That More Can Benefit From It\n\nThe first objective of policymakers should be to ensure the benefits of AI reach every corner of the economy. This can be done by helping to reduce barriers to AI access and by harnessing its ability to improve education and skills for all.\n\nHistorically, tech adoption has often exacerbated inequality by displacing workers, favouring the well resourced, and widening gaps in education and geography. But several leading economists \u2013 including David Autor,[_] Erik Brynjolfsson and Gabriel Unger[_] \u2013 have highlighted the potential for AI to reduce inequality and act as a tool for social levelling.[_] By enabling everyone to access more and better tools, and by optimising technology to raise the skills and productivity of the least effective workers, AI has the potential to create more opportunities for all.\n\nPolicymakers need to seize the opportunity to act urgently, to ensure that the gains from AI are widely shared, by accelerating adoption, and developing skills and capabilities in the right areas. As noted above, because we anticipate relatively little variation in impact between regions of the UK, all our recommendations are pitched at the national level. It might be that the need for some specific targeted policy initiatives emerges, but at this stage, an overly granular approach is, if anything, likely to be inefficient.\n\nRecommendation 1: Futureproof the next generation of UK workers by harnessing AI to boost educational outcomes and by refocusing the school curriculum to focus on AI-complementary skills.\n\nWhen governments come to think about supporting future AI success, the most impactful interventions are likely to be the earliest. Investing in the right changes to the education system could have the biggest payoff in the medium and long term, because a generation of AI-savvy workers will emerge, already familiar with the new tools on offer.\n\nThere are other strong reasons to treat education \u2013 where policy is very directly linked to workplace experience \u2013 as a priority case for AI transformation. Teachers, who work extremely hard at their vocation and are often stretched by the demands of the role, deserve support to enable them to deliver more of the things that matter. Technology can augment their efforts, cut their admin time and minimise duplicated effort. In turn, this can lead towards an education system which is more engaging, accessible and inclusive for students.\n\nAs a first step, the government should:\n\nHarness the power of AI to improve educational attainment and employability. AI tools, bolstered by a sustained effort to upskill teachers and support their professional development, can free up teacher time, provide data-driven insights on learning effectiveness and offer personalised, adaptive solutions for diverse learners. The Department for Education (DfE) should spearhead the rapid rollout of AI-enabled learning and teaching aids across UK schools, by first funding pilot studies in underperforming schools to establish robust evidence of their efficacy, identify best practice and then scale uptake.\n\nAdapt the curriculum to provide future workers with a robust and resilient set of AI-complementary skills with more focus on the \u201c4Cs\u201d (collaboration, communication, critical thinking and creativity), outlined in previous TBI paper Ending the Big Squeeze on Skills: How to Futureproof Education in England. By placing a stronger emphasis on a multi-modal curriculum and assessment, the DfE can enhance the overall curriculum with \u201csoft skills\u201d that are highly valued by employers and where current AI tools lack proficiency. In addition, the government should develop mechanisms to create a more dynamic curriculum that responds to the shifting demands of the labour market (including leveraging the new labour-market infrastructure in recommendations 5 and 8).\n\nRecommendation 2: Incentivise the uptake of AI training assistants in the private sector to help improve the productivity of lower-performing workers.\n\nAny policy response to AI needs to recognise the potential of the workers of today, not just those of tomorrow. Current working-age people \u2013 a very large proportion of society \u2013 could face rapid change and disruption in the coming years. It can be harder to effect change in this cohort, but the government must pay attention to its needs.\n\nHistorically, information technology has contributed to income inequality by automating away routine middle-income jobs, polarising the labour force[_] into high-income and low-income workers. AI has the potential to follow this pattern, but it also has the potential to do the opposite. As demonstrated in a nascent but growing number of studies, generative AI tends to boost the productivity of lower-skilled, lower-expertise workers by more than their higher-performing peers \u2013 helping them to catch up. One study[_] found that novice and low-skilled customer-service agents can use generative AI to achieve a 34 per cent productivity boost, compared with 14 per cent for agents overall.\n\nTo harness these benefits, the government should:\n\nDevelop an open-sourced AI assistant that draws on a broad range of free and publicly available skills-based courses [_] (such as project management or coding). This co-pilot, developed in partnership with businesses, would be made available free of charge to all employers to ensure uptake for employees across firms of all sizes. The co-pilot should be released under an open-source licence, so that businesses can build on top of it to include their proprietary training data for more bespoke features and content. The training tool should be funded and developed through a mixture of central government grants, sponsorship and partnerships with educational institutions, government agencies and tech companies. Contributions from the open-source community should be encouraged to continuously improve the co-pilot.\n\nIntroduce R&D tax credits to incentivise private-sector firms to develop their own AI training co-pilots aimed at helping new and less-skilled workers quickly become more proficient. The UK\u2019s R&D tax credits have previously had a major impact in helping UK startups cover R&D costs, including salaries, software upgrades and development of prototypes. [_] The government should expand on current tax credits to ensure they apply to a wide array of firms.\n\nRecommendation 3: Develop a new AI-pathfinder programme to encourage broad uptake of AI across firms of all sizes.\n\nOne of the sources of the UK\u2019s productivity problem is inadequate diffusion of productivity-enhancing practices between firms.[_] This challenge is made harder by the significant regional variation in productivity. Despite the potential for AI in sectors like manufacturing, and in improving productivity and decision-making, the latest research[_] shows that AI adoption is not top of mind.\n\nThe barriers here are not just a lack of resources but also organisational capability and expertise. Our AI-user survey highlighted that a lack of clear governance within a company on how to use AI responsibly led to slower uptake, and in some cases, a prohibition on its use. HR managers in the AI-user survey highlighted that companies, especially smaller ones, often do not have the necessary expertise or resources to effectively implement and benefit from AI technologies.\n\nTo overcome these barriers to adoption, and to avoid the risk that only the largest firms with the deepest financial reserves can tap its potential, the government needs a targeted plan on how to encourage a country-wide uptake of the technology. Our AI-user survey also echoed the need for the government to collaborate with companies new to AI to provide expert guidance and support (financial or otherwise) in navigating the complexities of AI adoption.\n\nThat plan should involve developing an AI-pathfinder programme. This pathfinder programme should:\n\nFund a series of AI innovation sandboxes (like Singapore\u2019s Trailblazer programme [_] ) to encourage small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt AI in a safe experimental environment, and to identify best-practice techniques of how to apply AI in both general and sector-specific settings (as with Germany\u2019s Green-AI Hub Mittelstand [_] and Singapore\u2019s AI Centre of Excellence for the Manufacturing Sector). [_]\n\nSet up a programme involving regional and local governments, tech providers and tech-advanced companies across different sectors to demonstrate how AI is deployed in cutting-edge firms , and support experiments in smaller businesses, including via advice on how to change work processes and workflows. Even at an anecdotal level, these examples can start to show the way for businesses in lower-productivity sectors, so they can access enabling technologies and tools with which to experiment, and develop use cases for their businesses. The sort of example the programme might spotlight is the US retail chain Sam\u2019s Club, [_] which uses AI-powered smart floor scrubbers to pull double duty by cleaning warehouse floors while also assessing stock inventory, raising employee productivity by 15 per cent.\n\nMake better use of existing data from other government programmes (for example, the Help to Grow scheme) and trade association data to help train a series of AI business-advisor bots. Existing business-advice programmes rely on one-to-one contact and in-person events, so are expensive to scale and often inefficient. Instead, the public sector could make better use of AI technology to provide personalised, on-demand advice on a range of issues including exporting, compliance and management. By providing support to stay on the right side of legal requirements, this service would give companies more confidence to invest and innovate, supporting high-quality practices. The scheme would be funded by re-allocating funding from existing business-support schemes (for example, the UK trade advisor programme and Local Enterprise Partnerships) in targeted regions. It would then be promoted by the government, trade associations and relevant networks to encourage further uptake.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the public sector\u2019s track record in outreach and support to smaller firms has been patchy for a long time. Part of the difficulty has been the sheer profusion of new approaches and abandoned strategies. Even where the outreach has been more sustained, the value of general, one-off advice has been limited, and the impact debatable. We do not underestimate the challenges these well-intentioned efforts faced. TBI\u2019s proposal is to use the technology to go beyond the limits of personnel availability and massively expand the utility of the advice. Once implemented, the service would be more sustainable and less prone to radical rethinks.\n\nRecommendation 4: Incentivise investment in public-sector labour-augmenting AI technology by creating national challenge prizes focused on alleviating labour shortages.\n\nIn the UK, 2.3 million[_] public-sector workers are in professions that face severe staff shortages and which typically involve large amounts of unpaid overtime (this includes teachers of maths, science and languages, doctors, nurses and care workers). Incentivising AI development in these shortage sectors is more likely to complement workers by alleviating heavy workloads instead of causing worker displacement. There are already pockets of excellence and innovative thinking throughout the public sector in trying to bridge this gap, but little incentive for the overall system to fund, support and promote their experiments. A challenge fund can create the means for safe trials of new ways of working.\n\nSince it is hard to know in advance whether a technology will complement or substitute labour, governments should focus on incentivising \u201clabour-augmentation outcomes\u201d instead of being prescriptive about the types of technology they encourage businesses to create. In our AI-user survey, there were concerns that human interaction at work is dwindling, and the participants welcomed ways of incentivising the design of AI systems that include humans in the loop. To achieve this, the government should:\n\nEstablish outcome-oriented national challenge prizes , to incentivise the development of worker-complementary tech solutions for stretched sectors. There are already examples of small-scale work in this area and the government should extend its work with innovation agencies such as Innovate UK (with its UKRI Challenge Fund on AI and the data economy [_] ) and Nesta (with its CareerTech challenge [_] ). The UK government should also tap insights from similar US-based challenges such as the $5 million XPRIZE for Rapid Reskilling [_] and the $12 million Future of Work Grand Challenge. [_]\n\nEngage stakeholders (including trusts and foundations, venture capitalists, tech companies, researchers and workers themselves) in the prize design and evaluation process, providing support and mentoring where relevant.\n\nB) Upgrading the UK\u2019s Labour-Market Infrastructure to Adjust to the AI Era\n\nThe rapid pace of AI-driven change indicates that labour-market churn \u2013 movement of workers out of existing roles and into new ones \u2013 is likely to occur at a faster rate. This is a sign of dynamism in the labour market and should stimulate growth. However, the UK will need to upgrade its labour-market infrastructure to cope with this pace of change. To successfully adapt to AI, the infrastructure must be agile, responsive and dynamic.\n\nRecommendation 5: Create an Early Awareness and Opportunity System for workers to make informed decisions about career pathways.\n\nAs we have already discussed, governments confronted with tech-induced change in labour markets can attempt to hold back that change and protect various professions from its impact. To do so would be economically damaging and likely futile. It would also let down the people it seeks to support: our research found that blue-collar workers favoured help to prepare for change over attempts to prevent it.\n\nThe story of technological change is not a new one: 60 per cent[_] of job titles in 2018 did not exist in 1940. But the likely pace of change as a result of the AI revolution demands a new pace of response. What the UK needs is an upgrade in its labour-market infrastructure.\n\nPart of the story, naturally, is supporting the conditions for a dynamic labour market where workers have the ease to move between roles and firms, and the ability to switch resources to where they are needed. This is an area where AI tools can be used to respond to the challenges posed by AI.\n\nTraditional support for workers who need to shift career has focused on those already affected \u2013 those recently made redundant or at risk of it happening soon. But given many people may have uncertainties about how their role is likely to be affected, there is a good case for bringing that support forward. There are enough data to provide good-quality information about the likely impacts of AI on different professional pathways.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organization,[_] worker-adjustment programmes are most successful when they begin in advance of expected displacements. Furthermore, our AI-user survey found that workers, often white-collar ones, underestimate their risk of AI displacement, thus delaying application of preventative measures such as retraining.\n\nThis will be especially important in the UK, where our analysis indicates that more than half of private-sector tasks are exposed to some level of AI automation, but the majority of exposure is in high-complementarity roles such as professionals and managers (i.e., very few roles can be fully replaced by AI). This indicates that the UK can gain significant productivity impacts if it moves early to secure a successful workforce transition.\n\nThe prize therefore appears substantial. In designing a new labour-market infrastructure, inspiration can be drawn from the credit industry. Consumers already benefit from access to information about their credit scores, and understand they can affect their future chances of accessing finance by following the advice of credit agencies, which have recognised patterns in consumers\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe government should therefore:\n\nEstablish an Early Awareness and Opportunity System, managed by the Department for Work and Pensions, which uses AI to predict the risk of displacement at least one year in advance. This system would expand the scope and functionality of the existing Jobcentre Plus Rapid Response Service,[_] which is reactive and based on redundancy notifications. Instead, it would provide a new public service for citizens to check their personalised risk of displacement on demand. It would also offer workers tailored information on opportunities to use existing skills to retrain and progress in their current pathways, or adopt another career pathway.\n\nThis system would be built on foundational data from a number of sources: 1) existing UK macroeconomic and microeconomic data (for example, from the Transformed Labour Force Survey, HMRC company tax returns and the Insolvency Service); 2) international labour-market data from comparable countries at the frontier of AI adoption; and 3) novel data on AI uptake across the UK economy. The latter could be sourced partly from private-sector data on AI sales volumes from company filings plus more formal survey data from an upgraded version of the UK\u2019s existing Digital Economy Survey,[_] an annual survey of how UK businesses use information and communication tec",

        "text": "Demand for AI skills is expected to grow in 2025, driven by tech and non-tech firms.\n\nTech industry hiring could rebound after several slow years, driven by demand for AI skills.\n\nAI skills are often scarce, with high vacancy rates for roles like natural language processing.\n\nPeople and companies are placing big bets on artificial intelligence. One of the safer ones is that demand for workers with AI skills will continue to grow.\n\nLabor market watchers told Business Insider that in 2025, as in 2024, many employers will likely be eager to hire people with skills in AI \u2014 like machine-learning specialists who train models, one of this year's most-talked-about roles \u2014 but also in wider areas that touch the technology.\n\nIn the tech industry, which has experienced years of lackluster hiring following a pandemic-era surge, there are early signs of a rebound, Hannah Calhoon, VP of AI at Indeed, told BI.\n\nIf that continues, she said, hiring will likely include roles involving AI.\n\nAnother area of demand, Calhoon said, could come from employers that aren't tech firms yet that need people skilled in incorporating off-the-shelf AI tools into their businesses and datasets.\n\nHowever, unlike the tech giants, these employers aren't likely to try to build their own AI platforms, she said. So, rather than trying to recruit data scientists and those machine-learning engineers, these companies might instead want workers who can help decide which AI instruments to use and how to incorporate them into their workflow.\n\n\"What they're going to be looking for is people who understand those systems and can help them implement those tools in their business,\" Calhoon said.\n\nThat's likely to translate to increased demand in 2025 for roles involving AI implementation and transformation \u2014 jobs like applications administrators or solutions architects, she said.\n\nThere are other signs that the demand for talent involving AI is picking up.\n\nLast week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that the company is experiencing \"a big hiring surge\" and working to fill thousands of roles to help sell products, including those involving AI. Benioff said the company has 9,000 referrals for the 2,000 positions it's opened.\n\nMasayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, likewise recently talked up AI's potential. At an event with President-elect Donald Trump last week, Son said that the Japanese conglomerate would invest $100 billion into the US over the next four years and create at least 100,000 jobs in AI and related areas.\n\nAlready, other employers are looking to grow around AI. According to Indeed, job postings mentioning AI that saw the biggest growth in the first 11 months of 2024 were senior scientists, software engineering managers, research engineers, and researchers.\n\nAI know-how is scarce for some roles\n\nThe market may be growing, though it can be hard for employers to hire in some AI-related areas. The talent firm Randstad reports that it's twice as difficult to find and hire senior-level workers skilled in AI and automation as it is for other senior-level jobs in different industries.\n\nRelated stories\n\nVacancy rates for roles involving specialized AI skills, like developing natural-language processing models, are as high as 15%, Randstad found. That's about double the overall job vacancy rate in the US. Randstad's estimate on AI jobs is based on an assessment of some 10 million job postings and 136 million r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAccording to Randstad, employers worldwide are having the hardest time finding workers skilled in natural language processing, predictive modeling, and \"stakeholder communication.\" The firm notes that this is partly because such abilities are specialized yet also in demand across industries.\n\nIn the US, Randstad said, the vacancy rate for jobs that require skills like natural language processing stands at 14%.\n\nStarting from a small base\n\nIndeed recently reported that, as of September, the share of US job postings that mention generative AI or related terminology was up 3.5 times year over year.\n\nYet that doesn't mean that all employers are looking for GenAI whizzes. Indeed found that only 2% of employers globally included skills related to AI in their job descriptions. By comparison, more than 20% called for basic computer skills.\n\nNevertheless, Calhoon said, employers' demands for AI skills are only likely to grow.\n\n\"Maybe not next year, but three or four years from now, in many roles, there will be an expectation that people will have basic fluency in being able to use some of these platforms,\" she said.\n\nThat's likely in part because it's not only major employers that will expect workers to have AI skills.\n\nAndy Schachtel, CEO of Sourcefit, an offshore staffing firm, told BI that businesses of all sizes are looking to AI to boost efficiency.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce found in a mid-2024 survey of 1,100 small businesses that four in 10 reported using generative AI, up from 23% in 2023. About three-quarters of small businesses surveyed said they plan to adopt emerging tech like AI.\n\nThat could add to the already surging demand for leaders who are experts in AI. According to a review of more than 35,000 public and private companies in the US by Altrata, a research firm focused on executive data, the number of people in the role of chief AI officer or its equivalent \u2014 a job many people may not have heard of until this year \u2014 was up 70% year-over-year through late October.\n\nThat demand is likely one reason that workers with AI skills or who possess capabilities working with AI tools are, on average, 34% more likely to change jobs, according to Randstad.\n\nNicole Kyle, who researches the future of work, told BI that even for parts of a business where AI might be expected to take on a good share of the workload \u2014 like call centers \u2014its adoption would likely increase demand for other roles.\n\nShe said that in the case of call centers, for example, those added roles might include positions involving data governance and data cleaning, as well as customer experience. That's one reason Kyle, who's cofounder of CMP Research, said she remains optimistic about AI's impact on jobs.\n\n\"I do think net-net, it will create jobs the way other technological advancements have,\" Kyle said.",

        "text": "President Biden\u2019s AI Executive Order required his Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) to develop an empirical model which could track and predict the impact of AI on the US labour market. The CEA recently released a report which, while early days, identifies current and potential differential impacts of AI by income levels, education, job skills, gender, and urban vs rural locations.\n\nThe CEDA starts with a big caveat \u2013 it thinks that, as with earlier technology waves AI will be a positive overall for the US labour market:\n\n\u201cEconomists and others have predicted for centuries that technological change might lead to widespread technological unemployment or drastically reduced hours of work. Yet, as [the figure below] demonstrates, measures of employment such as the working-age employment-population ratio and average hours of work show little evidence of decline in recent decades. In fact, the employment rate remains close to long-term highs, matched only by a period in the late 1990s in which technological change and productivity growth was also rapid, commonly associated with the previous general-purpose technologies of the personal computer and internet adoption.\u201d\n\nInstead, the CEA is focused on identifying whether there will be an uneven impact of AI across different types of work: who will be the winners and the losers.\n\nCEA\u2019s methodology\n\nThe CEA observes that predicting the labour market impacts of general-purpose technologies like AI is much more challenging than for new specialised technology tools which have a one-to-one correlation with individual manual job tasks. The CEA gives the following old world example:\n\n\u201cThe Luddites foresaw that new textile machinery such as the power loom would negatively impact wages and labor standards among skilled textile workers, and they destroyed that machinery in response. General-purpose technologies are distinguished not only by the breadth of their potential applications, but by the way in which they create new opportunities for improvements in other sectors for example, underpinning the adoption of technologies like the power loom was the steam engine, a general-purpose technology that could be adapted to many different purposes throughout the economy. Even as some use cases like the power loom negatively impacted some skilled craftspeople, a major effect of the steam engine was to draw farm workers into factory labor, and this likely increased the overall demand for skill in the economy.\u201d\n\nThe CEA\u2019s model builds on earlier labour models in which changes in patterns of economic activity across workers over time are corelated with an underlying characterisation of how a technology works, and with the timing of that technology\u2019s adoption. This index of the degree of alignment between work changes and technology across different job categories over time then can be applied to labour economics data, such as unemployment rates, wages, and hours worked to identify trends which inferentially are related to the technological change. The CEA acknowledges this is a mixture of theory and available empirical evidence.\n\nThe CEA develops two measurements: a score of the AI exposure, which is a measure of the extent to which AI currently is used or could be used in a job, and a score representing the degree of AI-related performance requirements, which is a measure that considers the future potential for AI to complement or substitute for human performance of job.\n\nThe AI exposure is assessed as follows:\n\nBuilding up a profile of work activities comprised in each job based on 41 distinct standardised activities about which individuals in all occupations are asked, with a ranking of relative importance of each relevant task in the job profile.\n\nIdentifying from the list of 41 tasks, the tasks which, at the time of measurement, are assessed on the current capabilities of AI as having a high exposure to AI (for example could be readily used to perform or assist in the task).\n\nThe CEA currently assessed 16 tasks as being highly exposed to AI, including getting information, scheduling work and activities, monitoring and controlling resources, and a little more surprisingly, thinking creatively and working with the public.\n\nThe number of AI exposed tasks and their relative importance of those tasks in the job profile gives the score for the job\u2019s overall current AI exposure.\n\nThis is a standard approach used in other studies of technology\u2019s job impact. The innovation in the CEA model is the second parameter, the degree of AI-related performance requirements. This is based on the following assumption:\n\n\u201cCEA\u2019s\u2026 AI-related job performance requirements use information from a [US Government labour database] about the degree of complexity or difficulty to which each work activity must be performed in order to perform one\u2019s overall job. The underlying assumption guiding this measure is that complexity and difficulty are closely related to costs of adoption. If it is more costly and difficult for AI to fully substitute for human performance of an activity, then using AI to complement performance of that activity may be more feasible or cost effective than using AI to fully automate the activity.\u201d\n\nCombining these two parameters, the CEA sorts the list of standard occupations into three categories:\n\nAI-exposed with high AI-related performance requirements: CEA assumes AI is more likely to be a tool used by these employees to enhance their work, as not a substitute for their jobs.\n\nAI-exposed with low AI-related performance requirements: by contrast, CEA assumes these jobs will be vulnerable to AI substitution in whole or large part.\n\nNot highly AI-exposed: these jobs may be safe currently from AI, but as they tend to be low skilled, many will be vulnerable to technology or economic change.\n\nMid-skilled jobs are in the AI substitution frame\n\nThe following table lists average occupation-level AI exposure and AI-related performance requirements across a range of occupational groups:\n\nFor example, architecture and engineering occupations are currently the most exposed to AI, with AI-exposed activities being half as important in the job mix in comparison to the general population.\n\nAt the same time, the AI performance requirements score for architecture and engineering occupations of 0.81 implies that on average, AI-exposed activities of these workers must be performed with a degree of difficulty or complexity that is more than four fifths above the population mean. For this reason, although 90 percent of workers in this occupation group meet CEA\u2019s threshold for high AI exposure, only 4 percent of these workers are classified as also having low performance requirements, and therefore will be potentially vulnerable. So, the good news for almost all architects is that they are safe, AI will be a tool not a substitute.\n\nBy contrast, office and administrative support have an above average AI exposure and below average degree of AI performance requirements, meanings nearly half of employees are at risk of being substituted by AI.\n\nFood industry employees have the benefit of below average current exposure to AI into their job tasks and, while the level of AI job performance is also low, their jobs seem safe because AI won\u2019t intrude into their workplaces.\n\nThe socio-economic impacts of AI\n\nThe CEA analysis seems to bear out concerns that AI could worsen current income disparities. The following graph shows the highest percentage of current employment in highly AI-exposed occupations occurs in the lower-middle portion of the occupational earnings distribution. In the third and fourth occupational earnings deciles, more than a third of workers are exposed to AI.\n\nIndividuals in the top two deciles are also comparatively likely to have high AI exposure.\n\nThe telling difference is that workers in higher-earning AI-exposed occupations have on average much higher AI-related performance requirements than workers in lower-earning occupations. Those in the upper income levels will not only keep their jobs, but AI may well assist them earn more of the pie.\n\nAI\u2019s impact on the historically disadvantaged\n\nThe following figure shows that although a substantial proportion of workers from all major demographic groups are in jobs with AI exposure, there are some demographic differences. For example, women are slightly more likely to have high AI exposure in their jobs than men.\n\nThe real concerns are the demographic patterns observed among all AI-exposed workers whose jobs have lower AI performance requirements and therefore are more vulnerable to substitution. Workers in these jobs are disproportionately likely to have only a high school diploma while workers with four-year degrees tend to be employed in jobs with higher performance requirements. Women are substantially more likely than men to be employed in high AI-exposed occupations with low performance requirements.\n\nUrban vs rural\n\nAs economic activity in service and manufacturing sectors tends to cluster in urban areas, it's not surprising that overall AI exposure is highest for jobs in the densest populated areas. On the other hand, employment of potentially vulnerable workers (who are both highly AI-exposed and with low AI-related performance requirements) is negatively associated with local population density. For example, more vulnerable employees are located outside the more densely populated areas. These jobs tend to be in suburban areas, and not in rural areas because rural jobs tend to be both low AI exposure and low AI performance scores. While this means rural workers, such as in agriculture, may be \u2018safer\u2019 from the threat of AI substitution than workers in fringe urban areas, those rural jobs are low paid because they are low skilled.\n\nThe CEA points out some surprising geo-location results:\n\n\u201cSome regions with among the highest AI exposure\u2014such as portions of Silicon Valley\u2014have among the lowest rates of AI-related performance requirements in the country. This suggests that the places that may be most at risk of substantial AI-related displacement could be quite different from the places where AI is simply being widely used.\u201d\n\nAll those \u2018helpers\u2019 enabling the geeks\u2019 lifestyles!\n\nDoes the trend data support this vulnerability analysis?\n\nThe CEA thinks it is probably too early tell the impact of AI employment substitution on vulnerable workers because firms are too early in their uptake and implementation of AI, but there are some worrying early signs. The CEA notes that groups which it has identified as being most vulnerable to AI, have been going backwards for several decades, and that gap is now widening at a faster pace although it is hard to tell how much is pandemic related compared to AI-related:\n\n\u201cEmployment growth of AI-exposed occupations with low performance requirements has been consistently slower than that of occupations with high performance requirements for nearly two decades, as well as of occupations which are not highly exposed to AI. In early periods, employment growth across these three groups was largely in parallel. They also responded similarly during the Great Recession and subsequent recovery. However, in more recent years, there has been some divergence in growth patterns across the three groups. The gap in employment group between the high- and low-performance requirement groups increased substantially in the latter portion of the last decade. And, employment in the non-exposed group declined more strongly and recovered more quickly from the pandemic recession period, potentially reflecting differences in the working environments of AI-exposed and less-exposed employment. Employment growth between 2021 and 2022 was again largely in parallel, although this finding is challenging to interpret in light of the ongoing pandemic recovery at that time.\u201d\n\nIs there a silver lining?\n\nFinally, the CEA cautions that just because its analysis identifies a group of employees as \u2018AI vulnerable\u2019, it does not mean that will come to pass.\n\nFirst, enduring unemployment may not be necessarily the outcome of AI substitution for a current job: workers may respond to the impacts of new technology by changing jobs or occupations. The US Labor Department collects data about the same workers in two adjacent years, and this permitted the CEA to run its AI exposure and AI performance requirements scores at multiple points in time, including for workers moved to a new job. While again early days, the CEA found some good news:\n\n\u201cRegardless of their initial occupations, workers are increasingly likely to have transitioned to an AI-exposed job with high AI-related performance requirements, and decreasingly likely to have transitioned to an AI-exposed job with low AI-related performance requirements. Workers who start out in a high AI-exposure, high performance-requirements job are increasingly likely to remain in the same occupation. Conversely, workers who are employed in low performance requirement jobs are increasingly likely to change occupations.\u201d\n\nSecond, employees may be upskilled in their current jobs to handle AI. The CEA found over the last 15 years there has been a marked increase in the average performance level required for the AI-exposed tasks and other tasks as well. This suggests there is a general upskilling at work across the US economy rather than being AI-specific. The CEA observes its analysis \u201cimplies that about 80 percent of the increase in AI-related performance requirements from 2007 to 2022 was attributable to within-occupation changes in occupational content, rather than to shifts in employment across occupations\u201d. Suggesting employees in current their jobs can rise to the changes in the US economy \u2013 potentially AI as the next wave.\n\nHowever, the picture is more mixed when looking at jobs with different skill levels. The CEA observes:\n\n\u201c[T]he complexity and difficulty of many AI-exposed occupations with low performance requirements have changed little since 2007, and this is reflected in the near zero change for the median worker in that category. On the other hand, the median worker in an AI-exposed job with high AI-related performance requirements has seen those requirements increase over time.\u201d\n\nIn other words, workers in mid-skilled jobs who otherwise would be AI vulnerable may be able to upskill their way out of vulnerability, but this may be less so with the lower skilled workers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CEA\u2019s overall assessment is:\n\n\u201cThe potential benefits from AI are substantial. Many workers are likely to benefit from use of the technology, and productivity gains could substantially improve economic wellbeing overall. Nonetheless, a subset of workers may be at risk of displacement, declining earnings, or other negative economic outcomes in response to the technology\u2019s adoption. Identifying such vulnerable workers in advance as CEA\u2019s measure attempts to do may help to ensure that policies designed to help them transition or otherwise adapt in response to AI are efficiently targeted and executed.\u201d\n\nThe CEA\u2019s analysis illustrates the broader social equity impacts of AI. The widespread sense of being left behind is already fraying our social fabric. While the Australian Government\u2019s proposed AI principles refer to the impact of AI on social groups, as well as individuals, it may be worth considering a more explicit objective of ensuring AI promotes social equity, along the lines proposed by Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Ash Centre for Democratic Governance and Innovation:",

        "text": "AI Waves Transform Vietnam's Job Market For Graduates Recent trends depict rising job insecurity and shifting desires among workers.\n\nThe job market for graduates in Vietnam is undergoing significant transformations as the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly reshapes professional roles and industry dynamics. Current trends indicate rising job insecurity among recent graduates, with many students entering the workforce under the looming shadow of AI-driven job displacement.\n\nWith reports highlighting the concerning impact of AI on various sectors, students are voicing worries about their future employment prospects. A rising consensus among university students is shifting attention toward the potential for automation to replace traditional roles, inciting fears about job stability and financial security.\n\nFor example, the emergence of AI technologies has prompted drastic changes within the medical sector, traditionally perceived as offering stable career opportunities. AI applications are now undertaking tasks such as medical imaging analysis, which could replace the roles of human diagnosticians at rates previously unimaginable. Specific advancements have shown AI performing with over 120 times the efficiency of human doctors, dramatically reducing diagnostic errors linked to complex cases.\n\nIndeed, for many recent engineering or healthcare graduates who thought their degrees would assure job security, the current employment climate may be less stable than expected. Amidst this rapidly changing environment, the emphasis has increasingly shifted from job availability to the quality of available roles and worker satisfaction.\n\nAccording to data collected by JobsGO, almost half (48.4%) of surveyed workers plan to change jobs within the next year. The gender divide within this statistic reveals 51.5% of male respondents are more inclined to seek new employment, primarily due to heightened financial pressures and differing expectations related to career pathways. Conversely, only 38.6% of individuals from the healthcare sector expressed intentions of changing jobs, indicating greater stability within this field.\n\nGeographically, the job-seeking intentions vary considerably across Vietnam. Da Nang and the broader Central region have shown the highest desire for change, with 63.7% of workers willing to seek new career opportunities. Conversely, Hanoi displays the lowest mobility with only 39.3% expressing intentions to change jobs, highlighting differing cultural attitudes toward job security and stability.\n\nThis year\u2019s survey encapsulates significant shifts as candidates increasingly value company reputation and positive work environments, with 72.8% highlighting these factors as top priorities when searching for new jobs. Such insights represent a notable evolution of worker expectations, where the focus is no longer solely on pay but also encompasses organizational culture and sustainable growth opportunities.\n\nInterestingly, responses indicate this caution extends to the specifics of salary expectations, with over half of surveyed workers stating they would require at least a 20% increase before considering switching jobs. This reflects the growing awareness of the need to carefully weigh the risk of changing roles against the security of current employment, especially as technology continues to disrupt traditional job landscapes.\n\nAnother dimension added to the conversation is the necessity for educational institutions to recalibrate their strategies. Graduates are being encouraged to hone their creative skill sets and adapt their mindsets to the rapidly transforming environment. This aligns with comments from industry experts who argue the ability to innovate and integrate cross-disciplinary skills might be the key to thriving amid the waves of automation.\n\nWhile fears of job displacement due to AI loom, sectors demanding high emotional intelligence and creativity remain less affected at present, reiteratively underscoring the need for human roles. Universities are gradually recognizing these boundaries and encouraging students to focus on enhancing their creative problem-solving abilities.\n\nMoving forward, the pressing question becomes: how will today\u2019s graduates transform their approach to work and career planning to navigate this rapidly transforming job market? Emphasis is being placed on adaptability, continuous learning, and creative thinking as fundamental tools needed to survive the potential waves of disruption surged by advancements in AI and other technologies.\n\nOverall, the market dynamics for jobs suitable for recent graduates are noticeably shifting, necessitating not only proactive approaches but also strategic foresight. Those entering the workforce must continually reassess what it means to succeed professionally as technology evolves and reshapes the job market they are set to join.",

The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n\n\nINVESTOPEDIA: What trends are you seeing in job postings that are not being picked up in the official surveys of the labor market?\n\n\n\nCORY STAHLE: There's been a lot of discussion about generative artificial intelligence and its impact on the labor market, but where we sit at Indeed, we've had kind of an interesting perspective.\n\nWe're able to look at job postings that are asking for generative AI skills. The impact is still pretty minor on the labor market. We're only seeing about 2 in every 1,000 jobs asking for Gen AI skills. There's a lot of promise behind these tools, but the actual adoption of the technologies still has a long way to go.\n\n\n\nWe've seen a lot of interesting data on our platform around flexibility. We've seen a rise in employers taking more skills-based hiring approaches. We've seen fewer job postings requiring experience. We've seen fewer job postings requiring education, and we've also seen employers raising mentions of benefits and pay transparency in job postings as well.\n\n\n\nINVESTOPEDIA: What do you think is driving that trend of increased flexibility?\n\n\n\nCORY STAHLE: On one level, the thing that's driving that trend of increased flexibility is worker demand for it.\n\nWe've seen that, especially for things like remote work, there are many workers who still would like hybrid or remote work options. And so, in a labor market where it still can be difficult to find workers, being able to provide hybrid or remote work options can give employers a leg up in the market.\n\n\n\nThere's also the labor market side of things as well. Even though the labor market has cooled over the last couple of years, this labor market, especially in some areas, is still pretty tight.\n\nWe've seen knowledge worker jobs kind of fall off: your traditional office jobs, like software developing, marketing, those types of jobs. Employer demand has cooled pretty dramatically.\n\n\n\nBut in areas like construction and manufacturing and some of these more skilled labor jobs, we've seen that there's still really strong employer demand and much more demand than we saw even before the pandemic.\n\n\n\nINVESTOPEDIA: Going back to AI, it doesn't sound like AI is going to take everyone's job yet, but what about in the coming year? Is it increasing a lot? What do you see happening with that in 2025?\n\nCORY STAHLE: It's certainly increasing a lot. If we look back a couple of years ago, the number of job postings and mentions of this stuff was zero. This stuff just didn't exist.\n\nWhat we've seen is growth from zero. It is still pretty small, but when you start looking at it, it ends up being three or four times growth in the last couple years.\n\n\n\nA lot of the job postings around Gen AI are really focused on roles that are creating or supporting the creation of that. We see what we call \"mathematics\" roles on Indeed\u2014which consist of data scientists, data analysts\u2014are one of the highest categories for using Gen AI. We also see it in software development and other tech jobs.\n\n\n\nBut we're not seeing it in a lot of the other kind of less tech-centered roles yet. We're not seeing a lot in accounting or sales, or any of those areas. As we move into 2025 I think we're going to continue to see that surge and that growth continue.\n\n\n\nEven if it were to triple in 2025, you would still only be seeing about six in every thousand postings. So there's still big room to run for these Gen AI postings.\n\nI imagine we'll continue to see and hear a lot of discussion around it and continue to see a lot of growth. But I think for the job seeker, there's no cause of concern, or fear that your job is going to be taken by an AI based on this data and some other research that we've done.",

Even top freelancers\u2014those with the strongest track records\u2014are suffering the greatest setbacks.\n\nPublished in the journal Organization Science, the research provides some of the first hard evidence of AI's immediate impact on employment.\n\n\"Surprisingly, top-performing freelancers are seeing the largest setbacks. For every 1% increase in a freelancer's past earnings, they experience an additional 0.5% drop in job opportunities and a 1.7% decrease in monthly income following the introduction of AI technologies,\" says Xiang Hui, one of the study's authors and a professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nA market disrupted\n\nThe study, \"The Short-Term Effects of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Employment: Evidence from an Online Labor Market,\" challenges assumptions about AI's impact on labor markets. Although AI is often seen as a threat to lower-skilled jobs, the findings show that its disruption extends to high performers as well.\n\n\"We're seeing a dramatic shift in the freelance labor market. Generative AI isn't just affecting the lowest-skilled workers\u2014it's disrupting the competitive advantage of even the best workers. High-quality freelancers, who typically thrive in tough markets, are losing out more than anyone else,\" says Hui.\n\nOren Reshef, also from Washington University, emphasized that AI's rise is shifting traditional labor dynamics: \"Skilled freelancers, who have traditionally relied on their expertise and reputation, are now competing against advanced algorithms that perform tasks faster and cheaper.\"\n\nGet free science updates with Science X Daily and Weekly Newsletters \u2014 subscribe now to customize your preferences!\n\nThe future of work in an AI-driven economy\n\nThese findings raise urgent concerns for businesses, policymakers and workers.

        "text": "Jobs in AI-related fields have spiked since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nOn the hunt for a new job? Building artificial intelligence tech could be a safe option.\n\nThe market for jobs in the AI sector has surged in the last two years, according to a recent analysis from the University of Maryland and job-tracking firm LinkUp \ufeff\u2014 the latest in a slew of studies indicating AI skills are in high demand.\n\nAnil Gupta, a professor of strategy, globalization and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland\u2019s Smith School of Business who co-led the research, said the analysis showed a clear \u201cChatGPT effect,\u201d referring to how the OpenAI-developed chatbot\u2019s launch led to the job posting spike \u2013 replacing many IT-related job listings.\n\nSee more\n\nThe analysis comes from AIMaps, a collaboration between the University of Maryland\u2019s Smith School of Business and LinkUp. The program tracks the growth of AI jobs across different sectors in the United States, such as manufacturing and retail.\n\nJob postings in AI fields have spiked 68% in the United States since the end of 2022, while overall job postings have declined 17% in the same period, according to the AIMaps data. According to ZipRecruiter data provided to CNN, AI job postings on the site grew 124% from 2023 to the end of 2024.\n\nIn January, LinkedIn listed AI engineer and AI consultant as the fastest-growing jobs in the US, and PwC found last year that jobs requiring AI skills were growing more than three times as fast as all jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, IT job postings (including those that write programs not related to AI) have also declined 27% since the end of 2022, according to Gupta.\n\nWhile AI has resulted in some new types of jobs, tech giants have also slashed their workforces after announcing major investments in AI technology \u2014 though not all the layoffs were because AI replaced human workers. Last year, Google laid off workers across its Google Assistant and hardware divisions a few months after announcing a multibillion dollar investment in the AI startup Anthropic. And a World Economic Forum survey last month found that 41% of employers intend to downsize their workforce in favor of AI by 2030.\n\n\u201cWe already know GitHub Copilot and other AI tools are able to do 60-70% of the coding,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cFour people can do the job of 10.\u201d\n\nAI on the rise\n\nThe global AI race is only getting started, as evidenced by the recent release of DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that shook the market with an AI model reportedly developed at a fraction of the cost of American competitors like ChatGPT.\n\nGupta said DeepSeek\u2019s open-source approach \u2014 meaning its architecture is publicly available for other companies to use and adapt \u2014 could accelerate the AI industry\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to an even faster deployment of AI technology in every industry, be it software development, technical services, banking, insurance, manufacturing, or agriculture,\u201d his team wrote in their analysis.\n\nOver two years since ChatGPT helped spark an AI boom, American tech giants are still making hefty investments in their AI programs. In January, Microsoft announced plans to invest about $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on AI data centers, and President Donald Trump announced the creation of Stargate, a collaboration between OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle that plans to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the coming years.\n\nSee more\n\nArtificial intelligence jobs are in especially high demand in the consulting sector, Gupta said, since non-AI firms typically hire consulting firms like Accenture and Bain to help develop AI tools \u2014 for example, a machine learning engineer or a product manager for a generative AI tool. Accounting firm Ernst & Young reported in December that 97% of business leaders whose organizations invested in AI saw positive returns on investment.\n\nBut many companies may still be slow to adopt the technology amid potential privacy and security risks, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.\n\nEfficiency concerns are top of mind for companies\n\nAI job growth is occurring alongside a broarder slowdown in hiring across the job market. Companies are increasingly looking to \u201cdo more with less,\u201d said Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, which tracks publicly available workforce data.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been centralizing functions, eradicating unnecessary roles, reviewing every function and reducing layers of management, focusing very closely on cost control,\u201d ZipRecruiter\u2019s Pollak said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a direct result of high interest rates and reduced access to credit.\u201d\n\nDespite the higher demand for AI jobs, it is too soon to tell how the AI boom is impacting specific jobs, Pollak added. She speculates hiring plans may be \u201cleaner\u201d now because AI tools have made some fields, such as content writing, more efficient.\n\n\u201cWe think that the jobs that are in particular adopting AI are seeing larger hiring declines,\u201d Simon said.\n\nCompanies\u2019 efforts to \u201cdo more with less\u201d extend beyond using AI in the workplace, with Revelio Labs reporting last week that US companies are increasingly hiring for high-skilled positions abroad, especially those that are suitable for remote work.\n\n\u201cThe realization that companies no longer need to hire consultants or software engineers in the most expensive location has made offshoring an attractive, cost-saving option in workforce planning,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe tech industry experienced rapid growth during the pandemic, as in-person businesses transitioned to online goods and services. But consumer behavior and economic activity have returned to pre-pandemic patterns, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.\n\nJobs in the software publishing sector grew 30% from March 2020 to September 2022 \u2014 but shrank 1% between September 2022 and December 2024, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Nationally, post-pandemic growth has been steadier, with a 2% increase in jobs between March 2020 and September 2022 and a 4% increase since then.\n\nAs for fears that AI will lead to mass unemployment, Gupta offered a more optimistic view, saying he believes the corporate world will instead adapt to the efficiency enabled by the technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when a six-day work week was the norm, and now (we have a) five-day work week,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cCould it be that in 10-20 years, it\u2019s a four-day work week? I think the prospects of that are very, very high.\u201d",

        "text": "Dr Fabian Braesemann. Credit: University of Oxford.\n\nTo find out whether the freelance job market has changed as a result of AI and how it may be reshaped in future, I worked with an international team of economists, mathematicians, and data scientists from the University of Copenhagen, the University of Oxford, UCL, the Complexity Science Hub from Vienna, ETLA from Helsinki, the University of Cambridge, and the Einstein Center Digital Future from Berlin.\n\nThe result of this two-year research project is a new study, published in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, outlining the labour market effects of generative AI. We analysed millions of data points from an online freelancing platform around the release of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nOur data shows that the labour market effects of generative AI are nuanced: for some jobs, we find reduced demand, while for others, demand went up. The job types that are most affected are those where generative AI significantly impacts work routines, that is, everything from writing, accounting and programming to project management and graphic design.\n\nWhether an occupation is at risk of possibly being replaced hinges on its substitutability or complementarity with AI. For a few job types, generative AI has become so powerful that it can effectively replace human labour; yet for many more occupations, generative AI can help employees be more productive.\n\nIn January 2025 the stock market reacted heavily to the release of China\u2019s generative AI tool \u2018DeepSeek\u2019, with shares in the American chip manufacturer Nvidia and other highly valued companies associated with the recent AI hype dropped dramatically. These rapid stock market movements show the market for generative AI technologies is highly dynamic. If generative AI tools continue to spread as rapidly as they do now, we might soon see large companies develop their own AI tools specifically tailored to the needs of their respective industries. The adoption of AI tools by companies will have a long-lasting impact on the job market. Dr Fabian Braesemann, Departmental Research Lecturer in AI & Work at the Oxford Internet Institute\n\nFor example, instead of spending a long time trying to solve a tricky programming task by googling or consulting online Q&A websites, a software developer can now ask ChatGPT or DeepSeek for help. The code can simply be uploaded to the AI tool and the machine will improve the code to solve the programming task quickly. It is these time savings that can significantly increase the productivity of employees in many different industries.\n\nBut what does this development mean for the labour market as a whole?\n\nFirst, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and other AI tools are not the big job killers that some have feared. Instead, generative AI can increase productivity if integrated smartly into business operations. The increased demand for chatbot development and machine learning jobs we see in the data points to the potential for tapping into new markets and product developments by utilising generative AI.\n\nOrganisations that successfully integrate AI applications productively into their business practices will gain a significant competitive advantage. Against this backdrop, we\u2014the users of AI tools\u2014can be happy about the new competition between American and Chinese AI companies: the competitive pressure will lead to more innovation and lower prices for AI products and applications.\n\nDeepSeek is also breaking new ground by making its AI tool available under an \u2018open source\u2019 licence, which should significantly increase the spread of AI applications in the economy. In contrast to other AI tools, users can customise DeepSeek as they wish and access the software's source code. It is expected that innovative companies will not miss this opportunity and will now try harder to generate new AI applications that could either make existing processes more efficient or open up entirely new markets.\n\nThe current dynamic market movements show that the generative AI hype is far from over. With every new model and software release, companies worldwide are learning more about how to set up effective AI systems. If generative AI tools continue to spread as rapidly as they do now, we might soon see large companies develop their own AI tools specifically tailored to the needs of their respective industries.\n\nTo harness the productivity and innovative potentials that generative AI promises, all economic stakeholders need to work together: firms need to establish practices on using generative AI effectively in the workplace. The workforce must be familiarised with the productive use of AI, and business processes must be adapted and modernised. Employees should embrace learning new skills that help them strengthen complementarities with state-of-the-art tools, and educational institutions should support that skill transformation. Governments should create regulatory frameworks that allow companies, employees, and the public sector to use generative AI productively.",

        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) could create up to 200,000 AI-related jobs in Australia by 2030, significantly boosting productivity and injecting billions of dollars into the economy, according to a new report from the Tech Council of Australia (TCA). The report, titled \u201cMeeting the AI Skills Boom,\u201d highlights the growing demand for workers to support the development and adoption of AI technologies. However, it also warns of a potential skills shortage without significant reforms.\n\nDamian Kassabgi, CEO of TCA, noted that AI is transforming the way people work and has been identified as a leading tech trend. He observed substantial growth in Australia\u2019s AI workforce in recent years, a trend expected to continue with the broader adoption of AI technologies. He emphasised that the growth in AI jobs will not be confined to the tech sector or traditional tech roles. Besides positions focused on developing, designing, and maintaining AI systems, there will be a need for individuals with skills in human resources, sales, and governance to scale AI systems and businesses effectively.\n\nThe report indicates that to reach 200,000 AI workers by 2030, the workforce needs to grow by 500% over the next seven years. Achieving this goal requires not only an increase in the number of workers but also adaptation to changing job requirements across both tech and non-tech occupations. The distinct skills and experiences needed to work directly on AI products and businesses could be addressed through a mix of entry-level training, upskilling existing workers, and mid-career training.\n\nThe existing strain on the tech workforce to meet current demand is significant. Increasing the number of AI development jobs could be achieved by providing alternative entry-level pathways, mid-career retraining opportunities, and upskilling in AI. Additionally, skilled migration could be leveraged, particularly for highly technical roles requiring experience.\n\nDiversifying training pathways, including an increased uptake in vocational education and training (VET) or short-course training, could boost the supply of workers in cybersecurity, product development, and design roles.\n\nThe report also suggests that promoting awareness of AI jobs and skills needs, along with enhancing AI literacy across the workforce, could drive job growth to support the scaling of AI systems and products in various fields such as finance, human resources, sales, operations, and governance roles in legal, policy, and risk and compliance sectors.\n\nPreparing Australia\u2019s workforce for the opportunities presented by AI\u2019s widespread adoption is crucial. Establishing pipelines of AI-ready workers to meet the significant demand for AI jobs is essential.\n\nA comprehensive AI investment and capability plan for Australia is also necessary. This plan would provide a clear path for regulation and governance, digital infrastructure, research, and commercialisation. It is essential to capture the economic and productivity benefits of AI.\n\nThe economic benefits of growing the AI workforce and enabling greater AI adoption in Australia could be substantial. The report estimates that greater adoption of generative AI alone could contribute AU$115 billion to the economy, with 70% of this benefit stemming from productivity gains.\n\nAustralians are already using AI-powered tools to help with tasks, which saves time and allows for a focus on more important and creative work. However, there is still significant growth to come, and it is vital to ensure that there are enough AI-skilled workers to reap the economic and social benefits of the technology as it becomes more widespread.\n\nKey points from the report include the potential for AI to create 200,000 jobs in Australia by 2030, necessitating a 500% growth from current AI workforce levels. Australia\u2019s AI workforce has grown significantly, from approximately 800 workers in 2014 to more than 33,000 in 2023. This number is comparable to the number of school principals or architects in the Australian economy. Most of the AU$115 billion economic benefit from greater AI adoption will come from productivity gains. To meet the demand for AI jobs, a combination of entry-level training, upskilling of existing workers, and mid-career retraining will be required.",

        "text": "In the coming years, AI systems will have a major impact on the ways people work. For that reason, we're launching the Anthropic Economic Index, an initiative aimed at understanding AI's effects on labor markets and the economy over time.\n\nThe Index\u2019s initial report provides first-of-its-kind data and analysis based on millions of anonymized conversations on Claude.ai, revealing the clearest picture yet of how AI is being incorporated into real-world tasks across the modern economy.\n\nWe're also open sourcing the dataset used for this analysis, so researchers can build on and extend our findings. Developing policy responses to address the coming transformation in the labor market and its effects on employment and productivity will take a range of perspectives. To that end, we are also inviting economists, policy experts, and other researchers to provide input on the Index.\n\nThe main findings from the Economic Index\u2019s first paper are:\n\nToday, usage is concentrated in software development and technical writing tasks. Over one-third of occupations (roughly 36%) see AI use in at least a quarter of their associated tasks, while approximately 4% of occupations use it across three-quarters of their associated tasks.\n\nAI use leans more toward augmentation (57%), where AI collaborates with and enhances human capabilities, compared to automation (43%), where AI directly performs tasks.\n\nAI use is more prevalent for tasks associated with mid-to-high wage occupations like computer programmers and data scientists, but is lower for both the lowest- and highest-paid roles. This likely reflects both the limits of current AI capabilities, as well as practical barriers to using the technology.\n\nSee below for further details on our initial findings.\n\nWhere and how AI is used across the economy, drawn from real-world usage data from Claude.ai. The numbers refer to the percentage of conversations with Claude that were related to those individual tasks, occupations, and categories.\n\nMapping AI usage across the labor market\n\nOur new paper builds on a long line of research on the labor market impact of technologies, from the Spinning Jenny of the Industrial Revolution to the car-manufacturing robots of the present day. We focus on the ongoing impact of AI. We don\u2019t survey people on their AI use, or attempt to forecast the future; instead, we have direct data on how AI is actually being used.\n\nAnalyzing occupational tasks\n\nOur research began with an important insight from the economics literature: sometimes it makes sense to focus on occupational tasks rather than occupations themselves. Jobs often share certain tasks and skills in common: for example, visual pattern recognition is a task performed by designers, photographers, security screeners, and radiologists.\n\nCertain tasks lend themselves better to being automated or augmented by a new technology than others. We\u2019d therefore expect AI to be adopted selectively for different tasks across different occupations, and that analyzing tasks\u2014in addition to jobs as a whole\u2014would give us a fuller picture of how AI is being integrated into the economy.\n\nUsing Clio to match AI use to tasks\n\nThis research was made possible by Claude insights and observations, or \"Clio\", an automated analysis tool that allows us to analyze conversations with Claude while preserving user privacy1. We used Clio on a dataset of approximately one million conversations with Claude (specifically, Free and Pro conversations on Claude.ai), and used it to organize the conversations by occupational task.\n\nWe chose tasks according to the classification made by the U.S. Department of Labor, which maintains a database of around 20,000 specific work-related tasks called the Occupational Information Network, or O*NET. Clio matched each conversation with the O*NET task that best represented the role of the AI in the conversation (the process is summarized in the figure below). We then followed the O*NET scheme for grouping the tasks into the occupations they best represented, and the occupations into a small set of overall categories: education and library, business and financial, and so on.\n\nThe process by which our Clio system translates conversations with Claude (which are kept strictly private; top left) into occupational tasks (top middle) and occupations/occupational categories derived from O*NET (top right). These can then be entered into various analyses (bottom row; discussed in more detail below).\n\nResults\n\nUses of AI by job type. The tasks and occupations with by far the largest adoption of AI in our dataset were those in the \u201ccomputer and mathematical\u201d category, which in large part covers software engineering roles. 37.2% of queries sent to Claude were in this category, covering tasks like software modification, code debugging, and network troubleshooting.\n\nThe second largest category was \u201carts, design, sports, entertainment, and media\u201d (10.3% of queries), which mainly reflected people using Claude for various kinds of writing and editing. Unsurprisingly, occupations involving a high degree of physical labor, such as those in the \u201cfarming, fishing, and forestry\u201d category (0.1% of queries), were least represented.\n\nWe also compared the rates in our data to the rates at which each occupation appeared in the labor market in general. The comparisons are shown in the figure below.\n\nFor each job type, the percentage of relevant conversations with Claude is shown in orange compared to the percentage of workers in the U.S. economy with that job type (from the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s O*NET categories) in gray.\n\nDepth of AI use within occupations. Our analysis found that very few occupations see AI use across most of their associated tasks: only approximately 4% of jobs used AI for at least 75% of tasks. However, more moderate use of AI is much more widespread: roughly 36% of jobs had some use of AI for at least 25% of their tasks.\n\nAs we predicted, there wasn\u2019t evidence in this dataset of jobs being entirely automated: instead, AI was diffused across the many tasks in the economy, having stronger impacts for some groups of tasks than others.\n\nAI use and salary. The O*NET database provides the median U.S. salary for each of the occupations listed. We added this information to our analysis, allowing us to compare professions\u2019 median salaries and the level of AI use in their corresponding tasks.\n\nInterestingly, both low-paying and very-high-paying jobs had very low rates of AI use (these were generally jobs involving a large degree of manual dexterity, such as shampooers and obstetricians). It was specific occupations in the mid-to-high median salary ranges, like computer programmers and copywriters, who were\u2014in our data\u2014among the heaviest users of AI.\n\nAnnual wage (x-axis) versus percent of conversations with Claude that involved that occupation (y-axis). Some illustrative occupations are highlighted.\n\nAutomation versus augmentation. We also looked in more detail at how the tasks were being performed\u2014specifically, at which tasks involved \u201cautomation\u201d (where AI directly performs tasks such as formatting a document) versus \u201caugmentation\u201d (where AI collaborates with a user to perform a task).\n\nOverall, we saw a slight lean towards augmentation, with 57% of tasks being augmented and 43% of tasks being automated. That is, in just over half of cases, AI was not being used to replace people doing tasks, but instead worked with them, engaging in tasks like validation (e.g., double-checking the user\u2019s work), learning (e.g., helping the user acquire new knowledge and skills), and task iteration (e.g., helping the user brainstorm or otherwise doing repeated, generative tasks).\n\nThe percentage of conversations with Claude that involved augmentation versus automation, and the breakdown of task subtypes within each category. Subtypes are defined in our paper as follows. Directive: Complete task delegation with minimal interaction; Feedback Loop: Task completion guided by environmental feedback; Task Iteration: Collaborative refinement process; Learning: Knowledge acquisition and understanding; Validation: Work verification and improvement.\n\nCaveats\n\nOur study provides a unique glimpse into how AI is changing the labor market. But as with all studies it has important limitations. Some of these include:\n\nWe can\u2019t know for certain whether someone using Claude for a task was completing a task for work. Someone asking Claude for writing or editing advice could be doing so at work, but they could also be doing so for the novel they\u2019re writing as a hobby.\n\nRelatedly, we don\u2019t know how the users were using the responses from Claude. Were they, for instance, copy-pasting code snippets? Were they fact-checking responses or accepting them uncritically? Some of what appears in our data to be automation could, in fact, be augmentation: for example, a user might ask Claude to write a full memo for them (which would appear as automation), but then edit it themselves afterwards (which would be augmentation).\n\nWe also only analyze data from Claude.ai Free and Pro plans, rather than API, Team, or Enterprise users. While Claude.ai data contains some non-work conversations, we used a language model to filter this data to only contain conversations relevant to an occupational task, which helps to mitigate this concern.\n\nThe sheer number of different tasks means it is possible that Clio classified some conversations incorrectly (please see the full paper, in particular Appendix B, for details on how we validated the analysis);\n\nClaude can\u2019t generate images (except indirectly via code), and so some creative uses won\u2019t be referenced in the data;\n\nGiven that Claude is advertised for use as a state-of-the-art coding model, we might expect coding to be overrepresented as a use case. For that reason, we don\u2019t argue that the uses in our dataset are a representative sample of AI use in general.\n\nConclusions and future research\n\nAI use is rapidly expanding, and models are becoming ever-more capable. The labor-market picture may look quite different within a relatively short time. For that reason, we\u2019ll repeat many of the analyses above over time to help track the societal and economic changes that are likely to occur. We\u2019ll regularly release the results and the associated datasets as part of the Anthropic Economic Index.\n\nThese kinds of longitudinal analyses can give us new insights into AI and the job market. For example, we\u2019ll be able to monitor changes in the depth of AI use within occupations. If it remains the case that AI is used only for certain tasks, and only a few jobs use AI for the vast majority of their tasks, the future might be one where most current jobs evolve rather than disappear. We can also monitor the ratio of automation to augmentation, providing signals of areas where automation is becoming more prevalent.\n\nOur research gives data on how AI is being used, but it doesn\u2019t provide policy prescriptions. Answers to questions about how to prepare for AI\u2019s impact on the labor market can\u2019t come directly from research in isolation; instead, they\u2019ll come from a combination of evidence, values, and experience from broad perspectives. We look forward to using our new methodology to shed more light on these issues.\n\nRead the full paper for more details of our analyses and results.\n\nOpen data and call for input\n\nThe most important contribution of this paper, and of the Anthropic Economic Index, is its new methodology providing detailed data on the impacts of AI. We\u2019re immediately openly sharing the dataset we used for the above analyses, and we plan to share further such datasets as they become available in the future.\n\nThe full dataset can be downloaded here.\n\nA form for researchers to provide feedback on our data and suggest new research directions is here.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe appreciate the productive comments and discussion on early findings and drafts of the paper from Jonathon Hazell, Anders Humlum, Molly Kinder, Anton Korinek, Benjamin Krause, Michael Kremer, John List, Ethan Mollick, Lilach Mollick, Arjun Ramani, Will Rinehart, Robert Seamans, Michael Webb, and Chenzi Xu.\n\nWork with us\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in working at Anthropic to research the effects of AI on the labor market, we encourage you to apply for our Societal Impacts Research Scientist and Research Engineer roles.",

        "text": "Escalating demand and diversification of jobs in AI-related statistics\n\nOur analysis, spanning from 2010 to 2022, reveals a significant trend: 11.16% of AI positions listings necessitate statistical expertise, placing it second in demand only to computer science. As shown in Fig. 2, despite the rapid growth in demands for all positions between 2010 and 2022, AI job postings have experienced significantly accelerated growth. The statistical job postings grew by a factor of 9.73 overall from 2010\u20132022, with non-AI-related statistical job postings growing by a factor of 3.12 and AI-related statistical job postings growing by a factor of 31, which shows a substantial disparity in growth rates between AI-related and non-AI-related statistical job postings over the same period. Notably, the growth rate of AI-related statistical job postings was 35.71% annually before the pivotal advancements in deep learning technologies (2010\u20132016), with notable spikes in 2013 (50.61%) and 2014 (44.62%). This suggests an anticipatory response by the labour market to impending AI breakthroughs. Post-2016, the growth rate decelerated to 29.64%, but the emergence of ChatGPT in 2021 renewed the upward trend, with an average annual growth rate of 47.11% in 2021\u20132022. Each technological leap in AI is paralleled by an accelerated demand for statistical talent, highlighting the rapid assimilation of AI within the statistics discipline.\n\nFig. 2: Time evolution of the various types of recruitment positions. a Trend over time in the number of positions across all jobs. b Growth trends in statistics-related jobs, including AI and non-AI jobs. Full size image\n\nThis trend is also reflected in actual hiring data, which has seen a growth of 2.67 times from 2010 to 2022.On the one hand, the rapid growth of actual AI positions is consistent with the results of the job postings data, proving the reliability of our findings, On the other hand, the growth rate of AI positions in actual companies is significantly lower than the growth rate of demand for AI jobs in postings data, highlighting a substantial shortage of AI talent in the U.S.\n\nThe evolution in AI-related statistical job roles over the past decade has transitioned from traditional positions to a more diverse spectrum. In 2022, the AI sector in statistics boasted 932 distinct job types, offering a plethora of opportunities for statistics graduates. Predominantly, Data Analyst roles (16.12%) emerged as the primary destination for AI talents in statistics, followed by Machine Learning Engineer (5.96%) and Machine Learning Scientist (4.34%). Notably, significant representation of roles in the financial sector, such as Risk Analyst (3.25%), Business Analyst (2.48%), and Marketing Manager (2.29%), highlights the burgeoning recruitment of statistical professionals in social sciences.\n\nFigure 3a\u2013c, based on job postings data, shed light on the top 30 AI job postings, revealing the dynamic landscape of roles related to statistics. The heatmap, divided into sciences (including pure statistics and IT, shown in red) and social sciences (blue), visually depicts the relative distribution of each role per year. Social science roles outnumber those in sciences, reiterating statistics expansive application in this field. A notable trend is the shift from traditional Statistician roles to more market-application-oriented positions like Data Analyst, reflecting an evolution in AI\u2019s role within statistics. In IT, the rise of Machine Learning Engineer and Scientist roles signifies a growing focus on these specializations. Conversely, roles in social sciences such as Actuary and Marketing Analyst indicate fluctuating demand, reflecting the nascent stage of AI application in these fields. The emergence of roles like Sustainable Consultant and the pronounced increase in Risk Analyst positions underscore AI\u2019s growing significance in environmental sustainability and financial risk management, respectively, as corroborated by industry reports (Deloitte, 2019). This trend points towards a future where AI is increasingly embraced across various sectors within social sciences.\n\nFig. 3 Time evolution of the distribution of AI positions in statistics. Full size image\n\nFigure 3d is based on actual hiring data, depicting the top 30 occupations in terms of the number of actual AI positions. The number of positions in the social sciences is not as high as those in the job postings data. However, occupations such as Software Engineers and Data Scientists remain prominent in terms of numbers. Interestingly, Historians rank third highest in terms of positions within the social sciences, according to the ONET codeFootnote 2. Historians typically analyze historical records using tools such as databases, geographic information systems, and other software. AI technology is already extensively utilized in this role.\n\nEmergence of disciplinary clusters in AI jobs involving statistics\n\nIn the BG database, AI roles that incorporate statistics frequently encompass additional disciplines, creating what we define as \u2018disciplinary clusters\u2019 within the AI domain. In 2010, statistics in AI recruitment was part of 49 such clusters, which expanded to 190 by 2022. This growth illustrates the increasing tendency for statistics to form interdisciplinary connections within the AI landscape.\n\nWithin these clusters, Computer Science emerges as the most predominant discipline, accounting for 24.52% of the total. The close affinity of statistics with mathematical fields is also evident, with Mathematics (16.26%) and Applied Mathematics (5.65%) ranking prominently. Other significant disciplines include Economics (13.35%), Business Administration and Management (5.48%), Physics (3.53%), and Engineering (3.11%).\n\nObserving the evolution over time, the early AI development phase (2010\u20132016) saw statistics primarily clustered with Computer Science (20.31%), Mathematics (16.16%), Economics (14.50%), and Operations Research (5.40%). During the intermediate phase (2017\u20132020), the confluence of statistics with computer science intensified (24.7%), while Mathematics (15.68%) and Economics (12.44%) maintained their prominence, albeit with slightly reduced proportions. Notably, Applied Mathematics ascended in relevance, and clusters involving Physics emerged within the top ten.\n\nIn the latest AI breakthrough phase (2021\u20132022), the integration of statistics with Computer Science further solidified (25.79%), underscoring the entrenched position of statistics in AI. The associations with Mathematics (16.83%) and Economics (13.82%) also strengthened, highlighting statistics\u2019 enduring significance in both foundational AI research and practical applications.\n\nThe modularity-based analysis, as depicted in Fig. 4 reveals, four distinct and stable disciplinary clusters. The foremost cluster, labelled in purple in the diagram, amalgamates statistics, mathematics, and computer science, predominantly focusing on engineering fields like automation and robotics. The second group is the green cluster of disciplines, orbits around economics and business management, intersecting with medical fields such as public health and pharmaceutical information. The third group is the orange cluster of disciplines at the bottom left of the figure, encompasses finance, accounting, operations research, and management information systems, prevalent in the business and management arena. The smallest clusters of disciplines marked in blue in the figure, integrates genetics, bioinformatics, biostatistics, applied mathematics, physics, and other related fields in biochemical and mathematical domains.\n\nFig. 4 Discipline cluster networks for statistics in AI recruitment. Full size image\n\nA deeper examination of recruitment texts reveals that in these interdisciplinary fusions, statistics contributes primarily its methodological framework, encompassing statistical thinking, methods, and techniques. For instance, the integration of statistics with mathematics is predominantly involved in AI algorithm development, data analysis, and model construction. The convergence with economics facilitates AI market analysis, cost-benefit evaluations, and strategic business planning. When coupled with finance, the focus shifts to AI-driven financial risk assessment, investment strategies, and market forecasting. Similarly, the intersection with operations research is centered on AI optimization, decision analysis, and resource allocation.\n\nShift towards hard skills in AI recruitment trends\n\nOur analysis of the BG database reveals that AI recruitment for statistics-related positions involves a comprehensive spectrum of 3987 skills, with a total of 6,324,462 instances. We categorize these skills into \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 skills, following the definitions provided by Hendarman and Cantner (2018), Lin (2023), and Peng et al. (2023). Hard skills encompass specific technical competencies, including proficiency in tools, platforms, or computer programs, and the capability to perform job-required tasks. In contrast, soft skills relate to personal attributes and interpersonal skills. Predominantly, AI recruitment in the statistical domain emphasizes hard skills. Among the top 30 skill requirements, eight are directly associated with software tools, occupying prominent ranks, including Python (2nd), SQL (4th), and SAS (8th). Additionally, broader hard skills such as machine learning (1st), predictive modelling (7th), and data analysis (11th) are highly sought after. The most prevalent soft skill is research, constituting 2.25% of the skillset, often complemented by hard skills.\n\nA temporal heatmap of skill demands from job postings data reveals a predominance of hard skills, both in variety and percentage, within the top 30 requirements. Further dissecting hard skills into \u2018theoretical mastery\u2019 and \u2018tool usage\u2019, it\u2019s clear that AI talent in statistics is increasingly leaning towards computer-related capabilities like machine learning, data science, and data visualization (Fig. 5a, b). These practical applications are rising in prominence, while traditional statistical skills like predictive modelling are gradually diminishing. Interestingly, the big data skill reached its zenith in 2017 (1.48%) and has since stabilized. The evolution of software tool preferences is evident: older tools like SAS and Microsoft Excel are being phased out, while Python and visualization tools like Tableau are gaining traction. SQL, however, has maintained a consistent significance due to its indispensable role in database management. In the realm of soft skills (Fig. 5c), teamwork is the only skill experiencing an upward trend, indicative of AI\u2019s interdisciplinary nature and the increasing emphasis on collaborative efforts across departments.\n\nFig. 5: Time evolution of the distribution of skill needs for AI positions in statistics. a Hard skills (Theoretical Mastery) evolution overtime. b Hard skills (tools usage) evolution over time. c Soft skills evolution over time. d The top skills in actual AI positions. Full size image\n\nThis trend is even more evident in the actual hiring data. Figure 5d shows that only four of the top thirty skills are soft skills, while the rest are hard skills. Similar to the job postings data, companies still regard research as the most important soft skill and place significant importance on hard skills like machine learning and Python. In addition, actual hiring data specifies more detailed requirements for employees\u2019 hard skills, particularly in software usage and programming languages, like C++, C, MATLAB, and HTML. These findings reveal that hard skills are highly valued in actual job positions.\n\nIn recent years, AI recruitment has also demonstrated a dynamic trend in certification requirements. The BG database cites 399 distinct certifications, with project management and financial risk domains predominating. The most sought-after certifications include Project Management Certification (8.79%) and Financial Risk Manager Certification (7.96%). Notably, there is a growing demand for certifications indicative of IT technical proficiency, such as CISSP and MCSA. This shift reflects employers\u2019 focus on practical skills and technical expertise. Contrasting with computer science, certifications for statistical AI talent highlight a preference for professional qualifications in project management and finance. Anticipating future technological advancements, it is projected that new certifications will emerge to meet the evolving demands of the AI industry. Consequently, job seekers should strive for a diverse certification portfolio to stay adaptable and competitive in various fields and technologies.\n\nEndangered skills and occupations\n\nWe analysed job posting data and examined endangered occupations and skills. Figure 6a presents the top ten fastest-declining jobs. For example, the proportion of Actuaries decreased from 3.27% to 1.44%, reflecting a 56% decline. Computer Programmers saw their representation drop from 1.59% \u2013 0.40%, a reduction of ~75%. The decline in these occupations follows several consistent patterns. Many of these roles entail repetitive tasks that are increasingly being automated by artificial intelligence. Additionally, advancements in technology and changes in industry dynamics are diminishing the demand for these professions. For example, the emergence of risk management software reduces the need for specialists in the field. Moreover, globalization and digitalization are reshaping industries, impacting occupations such as statisticians and financial examiners. Lastly, societal and economic changes can render certain professions obsolete over time. This convergence of factors underscores the evolving landscape of employment and the ongoing transformation of the job market.\n\nFig. 6 Top 10 endangered skills and occupations. Full size image\n\nFigure 6b illustrates the top ten skills with the fastest declining skill shares in the field of statistics show significant trends. Notably, traditional statistical analysis skills like SPSS, Microsoft Access, Spreadsheets, SAP BusinessObjects, Database Marketing, CHAID, and OLAP are experiencing substantial declines in skill demand. For instance, SPSS skills decreased from 1.16% in 2010 to 0.17% in 2022, representing a notable downward trend, and the most significant decline was observed in CHAID skills, dropping from 0.23% to 0.01%. The decline mirrors the broader challenge facing the traditional statistics field, where the demand for conventional data processing and analysis skills is waning due to the rapid advancement of AI technology and the emergence of more sophisticated data analysis tools and automated methods. Therefore, professionals in the field must adapt to stay relevant and leverage newer, more advanced tools and techniques for effective data analysis.\n\nOur findings on these fading skills and jobs can demonstrate that the impact of AI on traditional jobs in statistics is multifaceted, this impact extends beyond just soft skills, with even traditional hard skills being replaced by newer counterparts.\n\nEducational requirements versus practical experience in AI recruitment\n\nThe educational prerequisites for statistical talent in AI recruitment appear modest, with the majority of roles requiring only a bachelor\u2019s degree (66.85%), solidifying it as the primary educational benchmark. As shown in Fig. 7a, a smaller fraction of positions stipulates a master\u2019s degree (25.68%), and the demand for Ph.D. qualifications is notably lower at 6.35%. In instances where educational qualifications were unspecified in the data, we assumed no formal qualifications were required. Despite this, the average working experience requirement over the past 13 years equated to 3.9 years s and has been trending upwards over time (Fig. 7b). This trend suggests that in the AI job market for statistical roles, practical experience is often weighted more heavily than academic degrees.\n\nFig. 7: Changes in education and experience requirements for AI positions in statistics. a Trends over time in the distribution of educational requirements, b Trends overtime in the average experience needed for various educational qualifications. Full size image\n\nDuring the periods 2010\u20132016, 2017\u20132020, and 2021\u20132022, the average working experience requirements for statistical AI roles fluctuated between 3.9 and 4 years. The proportion of roles requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree has increased over time (59.48%, 61.76%, 74.25%), whereas the demand for master\u2019s and Ph.D. qualifications has declined (master\u2019s: 31.45% to 19.56%, Ph.D.: 8.18% to 4.62%).An analysis of the qualification distribution trends for candidates with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree reveals several key observations. Firstly, the demand for bachelor\u2019s degree holders has maintained relative stability over the 13 year span. However, from 2014 \u2013 2018, there was a heightened emphasis on more advanced qualifications for master\u2019s degree candidates, averaging above 4 years. In contrast, the fluctuation in the requirements for Ph.D. candidates was more pronounced, possibly reflecting the diverse nature of Ph.D. training programs. Secondly, there seems to be a complementary relationship between the qualifications of bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree candidates, while the requirements for Ph.D. candidates are more variable. Lastly, the demand for bachelor\u2019s degree candidates underwent a decrease followed by an increase, while the demand for master\u2019s and Ph.D. degree holders peaked around 2016\u20132017 and has been diminishing since. This shift may reveal a saturation of highly educated technical personnel in enterprises and a transition from AI research and development to practical applications. Post-2018, the demand for Ph.D. candidates continued to diminish, accompanied by a concurrent decrease in their qualification requirements.\n\nWe analysed the highest degree of individuals who actually hold AI positions in companies. We found that 25% hold a bachelor\u2019s degree, 42% hold a master\u2019s degree, and 33% hold a doctoral degree. This distribution differs from the educational requirements specified in job postings data. It suggests that while educational requirements may be decreasing over these years, individuals with higher degrees still predominantly occupy AI positions in practice.\n\nHeterogeneity in AI recruitment\n\nWe calculated the percentage of AI jobs under the field of statistics for each state in the U.S. (Figs. 8a, b). Our analysis revealed significant variation in AI talent demand across different states, with the northwestern part of the U.S. exhibiting a higher ratio compared to other regions. Washington has the highest ratio of AI talents in statistics (32.6%), followed by states such as Idaho (29.3%), North Dakota (28.7%) and other states, while Alaska (17.4%), Maryland (19.4%), and Nebraska (19.5%) rank last. The distribution of AI positions in statistics jobs is closely linked to the prevalence of manufacturing and high-tech industries within each state., for example, Washington is home to Boeing\u2019s production lines, as well as the headquarters of Microsoft and Amazon, leading to a stronger demand for AI talent in the region.\n\nFig. 8: Heterogeneity in AI recruitment. a Ratio of AI talent among statistics employees in different states in the U.S. b Ratio of AI talent among statistics employees across different industries in the U.S. Full size image\n\nBased on the distribution of NAICS 2-digit codes, we found that the statistics discipline is spread across 20 industries, and there is a significant difference in AI talent ratio between different industries (Fig. 8b). Among these industries, the retail sector emerges as the most impacted by AI, with an AI talent ratio reaching 37%. Additionally, the information (30.8%), management of companies and enterprises (29.2%), and manufacturing (28.1%) sectors exhibit high AI talent ratios. Conversely, AI talent ratios are generally lower in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting (13.3%), construction (13%), and educational services (10.3%).\n\nTo verify that the increase in jobs is a direct attributed to AI\u2019s impact on job demand rather than a spillover effect of high-tech industry growth, we categorized all industries into high-tech versus non-high-tech industries based on their NAICS codes. The average annual growth rates of high-tech AI jobs and non-high-tech AI jobs were 73.2% and 72.7%, respectively, the average annual growth rates of high-tech non-AI jobs and non-high-tech non-AI jobs were 14.7% and 18.3%, respectively (further discussed in the supplementary materials). Notably, the growth rate of AI jobs significantly exceeded that of non-AI jobs, whereas whether the industry was high-tech or not did not significantly impact job growth rates. Hence, we infer that the rapid growth of AI jobs is not merely a high-tech spillover effect. We also analysed the distribution of AI talent in the entertainment and arts industry. Between 2010\u20132022, non-AI positions in the entertainment and arts industry under the statistical subject area grow 9.7 times from 23,307 \u2013 226,397, while AI jobs grow 22.6 times from 30\u2013677.\n\nThe growth rate of AI positions in the entertainment and arts sector was much higher than non-AI jobs. But the absolute number of AI positions remains relatively small. These AI roles, based on the 6-digit NAICS code, are primarily found in the gambling industry, sports teams and clubs, racetracks, casinos (except casino hotels), fitness and recreational sports centers, and other gambling and sports industries. We surmise that because our study focuses on AI positions within statistics, the overall impact of AI on the entertainment and arts industry remains limited in scope.",

In contrast, overall job postings declined by 17% during the same period.Anil Gupta, a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Smith School of Business, described this as the \u201cChatGPT effect.\u201dOn the other hand, Gupta explained that IT job postings, including those for programming roles unrelated to AI, have dropped by 27% since late 2022.Job search site ZipRecruiter also reported a 124% surge in AI-related job postings from 2023 to the end of 2024. Global recruitment platform LinkedIn named AI engineers and AI consultants as the fastest-growing professions in the U.S. last month, while global consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) stated last year that jobs requiring AI skills are growing more than three times faster than other occupations.Two years after ChatGPT sparked an AI boom, U.S. Big Tech companies are pouring massive investments into AI programs.Last month, Microsoft (MS) announced plans to invest $80 billion in AI data centers for its 2025 fiscal year. The day after his inauguration, President Donald Trump unveiled Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure project led by OpenAI, Japan\u2019s SoftBank, and Oracle.While AI has created new types of jobs, workforce reductions, particularly among Big Tech firms, have also continued.Google, months after announcing a multi-billion-dollar investment in AI startup Anthropic last year, laid off employees from its Google Assistant and hardware divisions.A World Economic Forum survey last month found that 41% of employers plan to reduce their workforce for AI-related purposes by 2030.Professor Gupta remarked, \u201cWe already know that tools like GitHub Copilot and other AI solutions can handle 60-70% of coding tasks,\u201d adding, \u201cFour people can now do the work of ten.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIn the past, a six-day workweek was standard, and now it\u2019s five days.

        "text": "Article\n\nIn the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, finding growing applications across industries and occupations. This development has generated interest in how the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics assesses and incorporates AI\u2019s potential labor market impacts in its employment projections. In this article, we explain the Bureau\u2019s approach to this type of projections work, illustrating it with several occupational case studies based on research done for the 2023\u201333 projections cycle. The case studies focus on selected occupations in the computer, legal, business and financial, and architecture and engineering occupational groups.\n\nDiscussions about advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have become commonplace. In recent years, such advances have received constant news coverage, especially since the deployment of Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022.1 ChatGPT, a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology that allows users to have humanlike conversations, was the first to offer many users the opportunity to directly experience the potential power of AI in their lives. Millions of Americans have since used ChatGPT.2 Although AI and chatbots are not new, ChatGPT and similar tools have opened a new portal into the world of large language models (LLMs) and their wide-ranging applications.3 Generative AI (GenAI) tools are becoming increasingly powerful in creating prose, images, videos, and sound. Because of the sheer potential of these tools, many people have been asking how they might affect our future, including that of workers and employment.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment Projections (EP) program approaches AI in the same way as it does other technologies.4 Established technologies and other structural changes to the labor market have impacts that register in the historical data.5 BLS projection methods are designed to measure and reflect structural technological changes, and these changes and their employment impacts tend to occur gradually.6 There have been many claims about new technologies displacing jobs, and although such displacement has occurred in the past, it tends to take longer than technologists typically expect. Various technologies have had occupational impacts throughout recent history, but many affected occupations have still seen employment growth. Although it is always possible that future developments will deviate from historical patterns, BLS projection methods are not designed to capture extremely rapid technological change and, therefore, assume that the overall pace of technological change will be consistent with past experience.\n\nProjecting future employment involves substantial uncertainty, especially in the case of evaluating the future impacts of a developing technology. BLS acknowledges this uncertainty in analyzing the relative likelihood of employment impacts across occupations. In this article, we use case studies to illustrate how BLS considers various factors of uncertainty in its employment projections. The next section provides more details, along with illustrative examples, on how BLS has approached this type of projections work in the past. The section after that presents several case studies, based on EP research done for the 2023\u201333 projections cycle, examining the potential employment impacts of AI technological advancements on selected occupations in the computer, legal, business and financial, and architecture and engineering occupational groups. The final section concludes, summarizing our results and noting EP\u2019s plans for future research.\n\nBackground and research considerations\n\nEP research connects the potential employment impacts of a new technology with data trends. The goal of this approach is to determine whether these impacts are likely to continue as the new technology grows in adoption and maturation or whether they are likely to diminish as the benefits of the technology are fully realized. For an emerging technology that is not yet reflected in historical data, EP aims to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion about the direction and magnitude of the technology\u2019s future impact on the labor market.\n\nOne illustrative example of how this research has affected BLS projections involves photographic process workers. To show a decline in labor demand for this occupation in the early 2000s, when digital cameras were on the verge of displacing most film cameras, EP adjusted its models accordingly. Digital cameras improved on an already-existing technology, and the path to integrating them into business operations and consumer lives was clear. Digital cameras were already replacing film cameras, and the employment impacts of this shift were directly implied by the speed and maturation of technological change. Despite the absence of historical data showing employment declines for photographic process workers, EP projected that employment in the occupation would decline 23.6 percent from 2004 to 2014. Indeed, employment in the occupation started to fall precipitously in the early 2000s, declining from a peak of 86,300 in 2004 to 28,800 in 2014, with a further decline to only 9,200 in 2023.7\n\nBy contrast, EP did not make any adjustments to its models for another occupation, truck drivers, despite speculations about autonomous vehicles potentially affecting this occupation in the 2010s. At the time, EP determined that the potential impacts of autonomous vehicles were too uncertain, judging that any such impacts were not likely to be felt in the short-to-medium term. Specifically, EP deemed that incorporating the new technology into actual work would likely take time because of regulatory and public safety concerns. So far, history has shown this assumption to have been correct: autonomous trucking remains a developing technology and has not yet had any meaningful employment impacts. Employment of heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers was about 1.7 million in 2012 and had grown to over 2.2 million by 2023.8\n\nThe timing and scale of many potential impacts of GenAI are too uncertain to be reflected in BLS projections. New technologies such as autonomous vehicles or AI are harder to assess than technologies that constitute incremental improvements. The lack of relevant historical data on AI technology necessitates assumptions about both the time frame and scale of technological impacts. Brand-new technologies inherently present many sources of uncertainty, including those related to degree of usefulness, developmental roadblocks, regulatory constraints, and pace and cost of adoption. EP generally makes adjustments to its models only if its research on a new technology provides clear expectations for the technology\u2019s employment impacts.\n\nEach occupation involves a set of tasks. Even when a new technology advances rapidly, it takes time for employers and workers to determine how to best incorporate the technology into their work. Although new technologies may change the composition or weighting of tasks performed by workers in an occupation, sometimes dramatically, they may still have no employment impacts. For example, the relatively recent ubiquitousness of smartphones has likely changed the operation of many workplaces, possibly affecting occupational tasks. However, it is unlikely that many workers have lost their jobs to smartphones. In the case of AI, it is important to keep in mind that BLS projections are not about the overall impact of the new technology, but rather about its potential employment impacts.\n\nCase studies of AI-related occupational employment impacts\n\nThe 2023\u201333 BLS employment projections incorporate AI-related impacts for several occupations for which high exposure to automation is deemed likely. These impacts are discussed in a recent Monthly Labor Review article titled \u201cIndustry and occupational employment projections overview and highlights, 2023\u201333.\u201d9 However, researchers have identified additional occupations potentially susceptible to AI-related impacts,10 although the employment trajectories of these occupations remain uncertain.\n\nThis section discusses some of these occupations, explaining how any potential AI impacts on them are incorporated\u2014 or not\u2014in the 2023\u201333 National Employment Matrix.11 The occupations featured in this article are concentrated in the computer, legal, business and financial, and architecture and engineering occupational groups. The employment projections outlined below reflect research based on EP\u2019s interpretation of information available in June 2024, when the program was finalizing its 2023\u201333 projections. Other interpretations and conclusions derived from existing information are also possible. AI is a new and dynamic technology, and new information about its development and potential uses is continually being released. As such information becomes available, EP will continue to assess the potential employment impacts of AI tools and make appropriate updates to its future sets of projections.\n\nComputer occupations\n\nWorkers in many computer-related occupations use AI in their day-to-day work. Programming is one of many work activities in which new LLMs and GenAI are well suited to augment worker efforts and increase productivity.12 Software developers can use GenAI to develop, test, and document code; improve data quality; and build user stories that articulate how a software feature will provide value.13 The effects of AI proliferation on this occupation are highly uncertain. On the one hand, AI is well suited for the occupation\u2019s tasks; on the other hand, increased productivity from the use of AI may lower prices and increase demand for software products, thus boosting employment demand for software developers. In addition, AI itself may lead to increased demand for software developers, who may be needed to develop AI-based business solutions and maintain AI systems. Thus, despite its exposure to GenAI applications, this occupation is unlikely to experience a decline in employment, because robust software needs are expected to support continued demand for its workers. Although it is always possible that AI-induced productivity improvements will outweigh continued labor demand, there is no clear evidence to support this conjecture. Given these considerations, BLS projects employment of software developers to increase 17.9 percent between 2023 and 2033, much faster than the average for all occupations (4.0 percent). (See table 1.)\n\nDatabase administrators (DBAs) and database architects are other examples of computer occupations susceptible to potential AI impacts. With ever-growing volumes of data comes the need for data maintenance and security. Increased labor demand for DBAs and database architects is expected to stem from growing demand for cloud computing and data infrastructure. According to one report on the potential applications of GenAI across industries, superannuated data infrastructure is among the greatest obstacles to business implementation of the technology: \u201cAs organisations adopt GenAI, tech, cloud and data infrastructure will need to be set up effectively\u2014both the technology ecosystem and the capabilities within it. For example, data in many organisations is spread across multiple systems and data infrastructure will need to be set up in the right way to be able to benefit from GenAI.\u201d14 Consistent with this observation, a common refrain heard by BLS staff from other researchers, economists, and professors on the subject of AI is the claim that insufficient data infrastructure is the greatest obstacle to AI usage.15 Greater adoption of AI is expected to lead to greater database complexity, which could support additional demand for DBAs and database architects.16 As businesses race to integrate AI solutions into their workflows, they will need DBAs and database architects to navigate the obstacles to such integration.\n\nHowever, AI tools also have the potential to perform many DBA tasks, such as generating code, predictive analysis, and system integration.17 Survey results documented in a 2024 industry report by Redgate suggest that, at the time of the survey, more than half of respondents were either already using AI to improve the productivity of database management work or considering doing so in the near future.18 As more AI tools are integrated into systems management, the tasks of DBAs and database architects will likely evolve.19 Although some people may see these productivity enhancements as potentially leading to slower job growth in these occupations, their employment effects are projected to be outweighed by those of strong business demand for database management and data infrastructure solutions. Indeed, integration of AI into business operations is likely to spur even more demand for these workers. In the 2023\u201333 projections, employment of DBAs is projected to grow 8.2 percent, faster than average, and employment of database architects is projected to grow 10.8 percent, much faster than average. (See table 1.)\n\nTable 1. Employment projections for selected computer occupations susceptible to potential artificial intelligence impacts, 2023\u201333 2023 NEM occupation title 2023 NEM occupation code Employment, 2023\n\n(thousands) Employment, 2033\n\n(thousands) Numeric change, 2023\u201333\n\n(thousands) Percent change, 2023\u201333 Total, all occupations 00-0000 167,849.8 174,589.0 6,739.2 4.0 Computer occupations 15-1200 5,021.8 5,608.5 586.8 11.7 Database administrators 15-1242 80.5 87.1 6.6 8.2 Database architects 15-1243 61.4 68.0 6.6 10.8 Software developers 15-1252 1,692.1 1,995.7 303.7 17.9\n\nLegal occupations\n\nGenAI, particularly LLMs, can potentially greatly enhance productivity in the legal services industry. This technology can sift through massive amounts of information and synthesize findings, thereby reducing the time lawyers and paralegals spend on various tasks related to document review. Among the legal, tax, and accounting professionals surveyed for one study in 2023, 67 percent \u201cforecasted the emergence of AI and generative AI to have either a transformational or high-impact change to their profession over the next five years.\u201d20 Improved productivity was the top priority for 3 in 4 law firms surveyed, followed by improved internal efficiency.21 Similarly, another 2023 study found that the \u201clegal profession had the second highest [AI] exposure, with an estimated 44% of tasks susceptible to automation.\u201d22\n\nIn recent years, several companies have started to provide machine learning or GenAI services to law firms for tasks such as contract review, pretrial discovery, or research.23 For example, some existing AI tools can comb legal libraries during the discovery process, while others can serve as study guides or encyclopedias of the law.24 Researchers at Stanford Law School confirm these developments, noting that \u201ca dizzying number of legal technology startups and law firms are now advertising and leveraging LLM-based tools for a variety of tasks.\u201d25 Some of these tools are already in use to some degree, and more law firms are expected to adopt them over the 2023\u201333 projections decade. Partly for this reason, employment growth in the legal services industry is projected to be slower (1.6 percent) than growth for the total economy (4.0 percent).26\n\nAmong legal occupations, paralegals and legal assistants are expected to see the strongest employment impact from the productivity gains afforded by GenAI.27 Although the new technology is also likely to increase productivity for lawyers, workers in this occupation will still need to review output from LLMs and to conduct tasks for which clients may prefer human interaction (e.g., advising services). Despite GenAI\u2019s great potential for enhancing the efficiency of producing legal briefs and other documents, that output will still require detailed review by lawyers because it may contain errors or biases.28 Given that accuracy is very important in legal settings and existing AI tools cannot provide the legal context a human can, there will continue to be a need for human reviewers to understand ambiguities, identify model hallucinations or other errors, and ensure that true intent is captured.29 In addition, the efficiency gains from using LLMs may allow lawyers to spend more time on networking, trial preparation, and other aspects of legal work.30\n\nThese productivity gains can potentially lower costs for clients by reducing billable hours, allowing law firms to offer more competitive pricing. Because of continued demand for legal services, employment of lawyers is projected to grow 5.2 percent through 2033, about as fast as the average for all occupations. (See table 2.) This projected growth rate, which is slower than that in the two previous projections sets, reflects an expectation of modest productivity gains against a backdrop of strong overall demand (reflected in the projection for the legal services industry, which employs more than half of all lawyers).\n\nTable 2. Employment projections for selected legal occupations susceptible to potential artificial intelligence impacts, 2023\u201333 2023 NEM occupation title 2023 NEM occupation code Employment, 2023\n\n(thousands) Employment, 2033\n\n(thousands) Numeric change, 2023\u201333\n\n(thousands) Percent change, 2023\u201333 Total, all occupations 00-0000 167,849.8 174,589.0 6,739.2 4.0 Legal occupations 23-0000 1,394.4 1,446.2 51.8 3.7 Lawyers 23-1011 859.0 903.3 44.2 5.2 Paralegals and legal assistants 23-2011 366.2 370.5 4.3 1.2\n\nBusiness and financial operations occupations\n\nThe business and financial operations occupational group also may be affected by AI. The new technology is largely expected to improve productivity growth for certain occupations within the group, thus moderating or reducing (but not eliminating) employment demand for them.\n\nAmong the occupations included in this group are two insurance-related occupations: claims adjusters, examiners, and investigators; and insurance appraisers, auto damage. Claims adjusting and examining involve assessing damage to property (often a house or a car) in order to estimate the required payouts insurance companies must pay to their customers. In recent years, insurance companies have deployed drones to take aerial photographs of sites, without sending a human examiner into the field.31 In the future, AI is expected to work in tandem with drone technology to further bolster productivity. Once photographs are taken, the analysis and initial payout estimates, traditionally prepared by an adjuster, can be autogenerated by AI.32 In addition, AI can speed up other tasks performed by claims adjusters, examiners, and investigators, including summarizing \u201cpolicies, documents and other unstructured forms of content.\u201d33 Insurance appraisers, auto damage\u2014a smaller occupation\u2014are also expected to be affected by this technology because they can use the same damage-assessment software for cars and trucks.34 These developments mean that more insurance-related work can be done with fewer employees, reducing employment demand. Over the 2023\u201333 projections period, employment of claims adjusters, examiners, and investigators is projected to decline 4.4 percent, and employment of insurance appraisers, auto damage, is projected to decline 9.2 percent. (See table 3.)\n\nPersonal financial advisors, another occupation in the business and financial operations occupational group, have already begun to see job competition from AI. Specifically, app-based \u201crobo-advisors\u201d have started to compete with human advisors by providing automated financial advice on how much users should spend, save, and invest and how they should allocate their investments. Robo-advisors are especially popular with younger people, who tend to be more comfortable with newer technology and have simpler financial planning needs.35 However, given that the share of older age groups in the U.S. population is expected to increase over the projections period, the underlying demand for human financial advisors is likely to remain strong.36 Because older people are closer to or past retirement age, they have more accumulated savings and more complex investment advisory needs. A 2020 study found that the uptake of robo-advisors among older adults is \u201cvery limited,\u201d reportedly because these individuals are less likely to trust the technology.37 In addition, a 2023 survey found that the vast majority of robo-advisor users are in their twenties, thirties, and forties, with only 5.9 percent in their sixties or older.38 These population and usage patterns suggest that the demographic subset more likely to prefer human advisors will have more weight in the personal financial advisory market than the younger, app-friendly subset. Therefore, although AI technology can compete with personal financial advisors at their core tasks, demand for human advisors is still expected to remain very strong over the projections decade. Employment of personal financial advisors is projected to grow 17.1 percent from 2023 to 2033, much faster than average. (See table 3.)\n\nSeveral \u201canalyst\u201d occupations within the business and financial operations occupational group are also susceptible to potential impacts from AI automation. Because these occupations largely involve desk work in which computer software is already a primary tool of the trade, further software advances driven by AI could raise the productivity of many analysts but are unlikely to eliminate employment demand for them. For example, budget analysts, who are predominantly employed by government agencies, prepare and review budgets and perform socially oriented tasks such as making presentations and answering questions from stakeholders. Although AI will likely speed up the budgeting review process and even offer data visualization tools that can be used in presentations, the communication and customer service tasks of budget analysts (e.g., discussing the nuances and alternative paths of proposed budgets) will likely continue to require conversations between humans and cannot be easily replaced by AI. Given the expectation for a strong floor of demand for the core tasks performed by these workers, employment of budget analysts is projected to grow 3.9 percent from 2023 to 2033, about as fast as the average for all occupations. (See table 3.)\n\nCredit analysts also are experiencing the effects of automation. These workers analyze financial data and prepare reports used by lending firms to determine whether credit can be extended to individuals or businesses. AI can synthesize large amounts of data and reach big-picture conclusions, and, indeed, these tasks are the essence of a credit rating, which combines a range of financial information on a potential borrower into an overall score. As AI improves, the speed and accuracy of producing credit scores and reports will increase.39 Therefore, credit analysts are likely to see decreasing employment demand, and their employment is projected to decline 3.9 percent from 2023 to 2033. (See table 3.)\n\nBy comparison, financial and investment analysts are more protected from the effects of AI. Like personal financial advisors, these workers perform tasks with varying tolerance for automation, depending on the employer. Some financial firms lean heavily on automated trading with algorithm-based sales and purchases throughout a day, whereas others focus on long-term investments based on deliberate decisions made by a team of analysts who consider a wide range of variables.40 Although the latter investment strategy may benefit from software improvements (such as those providing faster and more useful numeric comparisons across securities),41 the final investment decisions associated with it will still be made by humans. Therefore, a sizeable share of institutional investment will still rely on financial and investment analysts. Employment of these workers is projected to grow 9.5 percent from 2023 to 2033, much faster than average. (See table 3.)\n\nTable 3. Employment projections for selected business and financial operations occupations susceptible to potential artificial intelligence impacts, 2023\u201333 2023 NEM occupation title 2023 NEM occupation code Employment, 2023\n\n(thousands) Employment, 2033\n\n(thousands) Numeric change, 2023\u201333\n\n(thousands) Percent change, 2023\u201333 Total, all occupations 00-0000 167,849.8 174,589.0 6,739.2 4.0 Business and financial operations occupations 13-0000 10,977.2 11,738.5 761.3 6.9 Claims adjusters, examiners, and investigators 13-1031 345.2 330.0 -15.2 -4.4 Insurance appraisers, auto damage 13-1032 10.5 9.5 -1.0 -9.2 Budget analysts 13-2031 50.8 52.7 2.0 3.9 Credit analysts 13-2041 73.7 70.8 -2.8 -3.9 Financial and investment analysts 13-2051 347.4 380.5 33.1 9.5 Personal financial advisors 13-2052 321.0 375.9 55.0 17.1\n\nArchitecture and engineering occupations\n\nGenAI can support many tasks involved in architecture and engineering occupations, potentially increasing worker productivity. In fact, many engineering fields are already harnessing the power of various AI tools. Although these developments may affect labor demand, the unique technical expertise of engineering professionals and existing regulatory requirements create uncertainty about the extent and employment impact of AI adoption. For this reason, underlying demand for engineering services is expected to remain strong, resulting in employment growth for most engineering occupations over the 2023\u201333 decade.\n\nFor example, civil engineers can use AI to account for specific building codes in designing complex mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, thus reducing the incidence of errors and design revisions and accelerating the design process. Yet, government-mandated quality-control regulations still require civil and other professional engineers to review and approve any work completed with the use of emerging technologies. Although open-source LLMs and small language models (SLMs) can complete specialized tasks when trained on high-quality data,42 the level of technical knowledge needed to navigate the intricacies of civil engineering work, such as those involving complex calculations or adherence to codes, will keep civil engineers in demand.43 As a result, the magnitude of productivity enhancements offered by various AI tools remains unclear, and strong underlying demand for civil engineering services is expected to offset the potential employment impacts of efficiency gains. Employment of civil engineers is projected to grow 6.5 percent from 2023 to 2033, faster than the average for all occupations. (See table 4.)\n\nTwo other engineering occupations\u2014aerospace engineers and aerospace engineering and operations technologists and technicians\u2014may also see some of their specific tasks completed or aided by GenAI. Aerospace engineers can leverage GenAI in aircraft design, prescriptive analytics, and predictive maintenance in order to increase productivity and efficiency.44 Likewise, aircraft and avionics equipment mechanics and technicians can use GenAI tools to perform various aircraft maintenance tasks, achieving more efficient and timely maintenance processes.45 Despite these enhancements, demand for workers in these occupations is expected to be strong because of the need to comply with federal regulations around quality control for passenger aircraft, as well as continued interest in and funding for commercial air transportation. Therefore, although both occupations are expected to see productivity improvements from GenAI, they are still projected to add jobs over the projections period. Employment of aerospace engineers is projected to grow 6.0 percent from 2023 to 2033, faster than average, and employment of aerospace engineering and operations technologists and technicians is projected to grow 7.9 percent, also faster than average. (See table 4.)\n\nElectrical and electronic engineering occupations may be even more insulated from any employment impacts stemming from the increased use of GenAI. This condition is due to the vast need for electrical and electronic circuitry and infrastructure modernization to support grid updates, electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturing, and other activities in industries reliant on electrical systems. So far, companies have released GenAI tools to more efficiently complete semiconductor chip and electrical circuit design tasks and related activities.46 For computer hardware engineers, the greatest productivity enhancements are estimated to come from increased efficiency in debugging tasks aided by LLMs.47 However, despite the rising use of GenAI and LLMs in electrical and electronic device engineering activities, employment of the workers performing these activities is still expected to grow. Over the next decade, the need for energy-efficient electronic features in EVs and electronic control units across products is likely to be robust,48 driving up labor demand. As a result, between 2023 and 2033, employment is expected to grow for electrical and electronics engineers (9.1 percent), electrical and electronic engineering technologists and technicians (3.0 percent), and computer hardware engineers (7.2 percent). (See table 4.)\n\nTable 4. Employment projections for selected architecture and engineering occupations susceptible to potential artificial intelligence impacts, 2023\u201333 2023 NEM occupation title 2023 NEM occupation code Employment, 2023\n\n(thousands) Employment, 2033\n\n(thousands) Numeric change, 2023\u201333\n\n(thousands) Percent change, 2023\u201333 Total, all occupations 00-0000 167,849.8 174,589.0 6,739.2 4.0 Architecture and engineering occupations 17-0000 2,639.7 2,819.7 180.0 6.8 Aerospace engineers 17-2011 68.9 73.0 4.1 6.0 Civil engineers 17-2051 341.8 363.9 22.1 6.5 Electrical engineers 17-2071 189.1 206.3 17.2 9.1 Electronics engineers, except computer 17-2072 98.7 107.6 8.9 9.1 Aerospace engineering and operations technologists and technicians 17-3021 11.0 11.9 0.9 7.9 Electrical and electronic engineering technologists and technicians 17-3023 99.6 102.6 3.0 3.0\n\nConclusion\n\nThe potential for AI, particularly GenAI, to disrupt future employment has been a prominent topic in recent economic commentary. BLS employment projections consider and reflect the productivity-enhancing effects of automation and a wide range of technologies, including AI, on occupations and industries. Over the 2023\u201333 projections period, AI is expected to primarily affect occupations whose core tasks can be most easily replicated by GenAI in its current form. These occupations include medical transcriptionists and customer service representatives, whose employment is projected to decline by 4.7 and 5.0 percent, respectively, through 2033.49\n\nOther occupations also may see AI impacts, although not to the same extent. For instance, computer occupations may see productivity impacts from AI, but the need to implement and maintain AI infrastructure could in actuality boost demand for some occupations in this group. Among legal occupations, paralegals and legal assistants are likely to experience lower employment demand because of LLM adoption, while lawyers are expected to be less affected. Within business and financial operations occupations, insurance adjusters and appraisers are expected to see reduced employment demand, with AI being able to quickly produce monetary estimates of property damage. Meanwhile, other occupations in this group, such as personal financial advisors, will likely continue to see strong employment growth because demand for human counsel in complex financial matters will persist, particularly for older clients. Architecture and engineering occupations may see some productivity gains from GenAI, but these gains will likely be in line with those afforded by software and other technological advancements in prior decades. As a result, occupations in this group are not expected to see substantial GenAI-driven reductions in employment demand over the projections period.\n\nEach year, BLS issues new 10-year projections that incorporate new data, research, and analysis. EP continually conducts research on new technologies, including AI and LLMs, to better understand their potential employment and economic impacts over the projections period. Besides reflecting these findings in its 10-year projections, the program also evaluates previous projections, explores shifts among skills that are in demand, and considers the potential for technology to create new types of jobs. EP will continue to monitor AI as it evolves, ensuring that BLS projections reflect an updated assessment of the latest developments in this technology and its likely employment impacts.",

        "text": "TORONTO, Oct. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, the Vector Institute issued a new report, prepared by the Conference Board of Canada in partnership with the Future Skills Centre, aimed at better understanding and addressing challenges in building an artificial intelligence (AI) capable workforce in this country. The \"Artificial Intelligence Talent in Canada\" report highlights a significant shift in Canada\u2019s AI talent landscape with implications for businesses, job seekers, and post-secondary institutions.\n\nThe report reveals a 37% increase in demand for core AI skills from 2018 to 2023. The growing demand is driven by rising needs in knowledge areas like machine learning, deep learning, and AI ethics and governance, which are directly related to AI development and application.\n\nIn contrast, demand for peripheral AI skills \u2014 those supporting AI use but applicable in other contexts \u2014 dropped by 46.4% during the same period. The decrease in demand for peripheral skills like software development and design or cloud computing suggests that automation tools and programs are increasingly augmenting these skills.\n\n\"This report offers a crucial industry perspective on AI hiring,\" said Melissa Judd, Vice President of Research Operations & Academic Partnerships at the Vector Institute. \u201cIt highlights three critical findings: a significant increase in demand for AI skills, the fundamental importance of deep technical expertise for employers, and the abundance of these skills in Canada's workforce. Early national investment in AI talent development has positioned Canada as a leader in this field. We must now focus on cultivating translational skills that bridge technical expertise with business and domain-specific applications, and increase capacity in AI governance to capitalize on this leadership.\"\n\nOther findings from the report include:\n\nSkills related to running AI systems and managing machine learning projects experienced the largest growth with job postings in Canada increasing by 48% and 60% respectively since the lifting of pandemic restrictions.\n\nCanadian start-ups and scale-ups still face challenges in hiring senior, specialized employees, often losing candidates to competitors in Canada and the United States.\n\nLarger Canadian organizations in AI-adjacent sectors such as health, retail, and transportation each report challenges in AI adoption, including cost concerns and a lack of AI literacy among decision-makers.\n\nWhile the United States leads in AI adoption and research investment, it faces a significant talent shortage, particularly in advanced AI skills. In contrast, Canada boasts a robust AI talent pool but must focus on leveraging this pool to boost industry adoption and investment. Achieving this leverage is key to attracting and retaining top AI talent and researchers and ensuring Canada remains at the forefront of AI innovation.\n\nTo maintain Canada's AI talent edge, the report contains key recommendations including:\n\nStrengthening AI education: Continue producing top-tier AI specialists through advanced research programs at Canadian post-secondary institutions, leveraging Canada's existing global AI advantage, and expanding programs that foster cross-disciplinary expertise in AI and domains such as health and finance. Canada also needs to support high-quality training for people to integrate AI tools into their existing roles and become more resilient during future labour market changes.\n\nContinue producing top-tier AI specialists through advanced research programs at Canadian post-secondary institutions, leveraging Canada's existing global AI advantage, and expanding programs that foster cross-disciplinary expertise in AI and domains such as health and finance.

        "text": "In the forthcoming issue of theHRDIRECTOR a poll revealed that 69 percent of employees do not fear AI replacing them, even though as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, its influence on the job market and workplace becomes more pronounced. AI is no longer a distant concept but a transformative force reshaping industries and the way people work. From job automation to the emergence of new career paths, AI\u2019s impact on people\u2019s jobs presents both challenges and opportunities. In this article, we\u2019ll explore how AI will affect employment, job roles, and the future of work.\n\nThe Role of AI in Job Automation\n\nOne of the most significant ways AI is influencing employment is through job automation. AI systems are increasingly being used to perform tasks that are repetitive, manual, or data-driven, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative responsibilities. Industries such as manufacturing, customer service, logistics, and retail are already witnessing a rise in automation through the use of AI-powered robots, chatbots, and machine learning algorithms.\n\nFor example, in manufacturing, AI is streamlining production lines and improving efficiency. In customer service, AI-driven chatbots handle basic inquiries, reducing the need for live agents. This automation can lead to job displacement, particularly for workers in roles like assembly line workers, data entry clerks, and cashiers. A report by McKinsey Global Institute predicts that by 2030, up to 800 million jobs globally could be displaced due to automation.\n\nHowever, AI is not solely about replacing jobs. It is also creating new opportunities in sectors related to AI technology, such as data science, machine learning engineering, and AI programming. As AI technologies continue to advance, new roles requiring specialized skills will emerge, opening doors for workers who are able to adapt to the evolving landscape.\n\nAI\u2019s Positive Impact on Job Productivity and Innovation\n\nWhile some jobs may be at risk of automation, AI can significantly boost productivity and innovation in various industries. By automating repetitive tasks, AI enables human workers to focus on higher-level functions, such as strategic decision-making, creativity, and problem-solving. This could lead to increased productivity and the creation of more valuable jobs.\n\nIn healthcare, for example, AI-powered tools are improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care. AI algorithms can analyze medical data faster than human doctors, identifying patterns that may go unnoticed, which helps medical professionals make better decisions. In marketing, AI can predict customer behavior, create personalized experiences, and improve advertising strategies. These advancements could lead to more job opportunities for professionals in sectors like AI-enhanced marketing, data analytics, and product development.\n\nAI\u2019s ability to augment human capabilities in various industries suggests that the future of work will be about collaboration between humans and machines, rather than competition.\n\nThe Growing Demand for Reskilling and Lifelong Learning\n\nAs AI transforms industries, reskilling will be a crucial factor in helping workers adapt. According to a World Economic Forum report, reskilling and upskilling will become essential as AI increasingly reshapes the job market. Workers who can develop skills in areas like AI programming, data science, and digital marketing will be better positioned to thrive in the new economy.\n\nLifelong learning will become a key factor in career longevity. Workers in industries affected by AI automation will need to transition into new roles that require a mix of technical, creative, and emotional intelligence skills. Training programs, certifications, and online learning platforms will play a vital role in ensuring that workers can acquire the skills needed to succeed in an AI-driven workforce.\n\nThe Ethical Implications of AI in the Workforce\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into the workplace, ethical considerations surrounding job displacement and income inequality will become increasingly important. While AI technologies can create efficiencies and lower costs for businesses, there is a concern that automation will disproportionately affect lower-wage and manual labor jobs, deepening existing inequalities.\n\nMoreover, the rise of AI could lead to a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few tech companies that control these technologies. Governments and organizations will need to implement policies that ensure fair distribution of the benefits of AI. This could include measures like universal basic income (UBI), stronger labor protections, and programs to support workers transitioning into new industries.\n\nAI in the Gig Economy: Opportunities and Challenges\n\nThe gig economy has already seen significant growth with the help of AI-powered platforms. Freelance job platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit use AI algorithms to match freelancers with clients, helping workers find job opportunities more efficiently. AI is also streamlining administrative tasks for freelancers, such as time tracking, invoicing, and task management.\n\nWhile AI in the gig economy offers flexibility and access to a broader range of opportunities, it also raises concerns about job security, lack of benefits, and wage stagnation. As AI algorithms increasingly determine job allocation and compensation, workers may face greater pressure to accept lower-paying gigs to remain competitive.\n\nConclusion: Preparing for the Future of Work with AI\n\nThe impact of AI on jobs is a complex and multifaceted issue. While AI is likely to displace certain roles, it also holds the potential to create new career opportunities, enhance productivity, and drive innovation. To navigate the challenges and opportunities of an AI-driven economy, workers will need to invest in reskilling and continuous learning. Companies and governments must work together to create policies and programs that support workers during this transition and ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed fairly.\n\nUltimately, the future of work with AI will be one of collaboration rather than replacement. Workers who embrace AI as a tool to enhance their skills will be better equipped to thrive in a world where machines and humans work together to solve complex problems and drive progress.",

        "text": "Asia-Pacific\u2019s economies are likely to experience labor market shifts because of artificial intelligence, with advanced economies being affected more. About half of all jobs in the region\u2019s advanced economies are exposed to AI, compared to only about a quarter in emerging market and developing economies.\n\nHowever, as we show in our latest Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook, there are also more jobs in the region\u2019s advanced economies that can be complemented by AI, meaning that the technology will likely enhance productivity rather than replace these roles altogether.\n\nThe concentration of such jobs in Asia\u2019s advanced economies could worsen inequality between countries over time. While about 40 percent of jobs in Singapore are rated as highly complementary to AI, the share is just 3 percent in Laos.\n\nAI could also increase inequality within countries. Most workers at risk of displacement in the Asia-Pacific region work in service, sales, and clerical support roles. Meanwhile, workers who are more likely to benefit from AI typically work in managerial, professional, and technician roles that already tend to be among the better paid professions.\n\nAs the Chart of the Week shows, we also find that women are more likely to be at risk of disruption from AI because they are more often in service, sales, and clerical roles. Men, by contrast, are more represented in occupations that are unlikely to be impacted by AI at this stage, like farm workers, machine operators, and low-skill elementary workers.\n\nHow could policymakers address the threat of worsening inequality?\n\nFirst, effective social safety nets combined with reskilling programs for affected workers will be critical to achieve an inclusive AI transition.\n\nSecond, education and training to help the workforce leverage what AI makes possible will be especially relevant in Asia\u2019s emerging economies, given that they have relatively few jobs in which AI could make workers more productive. It will also help displaced workers transition to new roles and support research and development that enhances innovation.\n\nIn addition, governments should set regulations that promote ethical AI use and data protection. Doing so can mitigate the risks of AI-induced disruptions and better capitalize on the opportunities for economic growth and improved productivity.\n\n\u2014This blog is based on Box 1 of the analytical note included in the October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook. For more on AI and jobs, see IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva\u2019s blog on labor market implications and the Chart of the Week showing which economies are better equipped for AI adoption.",

        "text": "How many jobs will be lost to AI?\n\nThe TBI report predicts up to three million job losses \u2013 but the detail is less alarming. Growth in the technology will also create new roles, TBI predicts, minimising job losses to somewhere in the \u201clow hundreds of thousands\u201d.\n\n\u201cA common lesson is that AI is likely to increase the dynamism of the labour market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones,\u201d the report\u2019s authors conclude.\n\nAdministrative and secretarial jobs will be the most vulnerable to AI displacement, followed by sales, customer service, and banking and finance roles. TBI call for an upgrade to \u201clabour-market infrastructure to cope with the higher rate of churn\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt would be a mistake to concentrate all policy direction on limiting the disruption that this will bring,\u201d the authors add. \u201cAny policies designed to hold back the tide will likely be ineffective and damaging in the long term.\u201d\n\nHowever, limiting the disruption is \u2013 in part \u2013 a very good goal, says IPPR\u2019s Desikan.\n\n\u201cWe have choice. What kind of societal direction do we want from AI? What\u2019s important is not allowing private firms alone to decide the direction of this change,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertising helps fund Big Issue\u2019s mission to end poverty\n\n\u201cWe need, for example, consultation with workers and unions about what specific AI tools can be used in the workplace.\u201d\n\nIn the IPPR analysis from earlier this year, the implications of these choices became increasingly clear.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, the IPPR report says, 7.9 million jobs will be lost. In a best-case scenario, all jobs at risk are augmented to adapt to AI, instead of replaced. This leads to no job losses and an economic boost of 13% to GDP (\u00a3306bn per year). Additionally, wage gains for workers could be huge \u2013 more than 30% in some cases.\n\nTo make this a reality, the government must adopt a \u201cjob-centric industrial strategy\u201d, offering tax incentives or subsidies to encourage job-augmentation over full displacement. Areas like health should be regulated to ensure \u201chuman responsibility of key issues\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe called for something called \u2018ring-fencing,\u2019\u201d Desikan said. \u201cTake teaching, for example. Technically, lot of the tasks which teachers do could \u2013 on paper \u2013 be replaced by AI. But whether we want these tasks to be replaced by AI is a different question.\u201d\n\nWhere there is job restructuring, Desikan adds, workers and trade unions should have a legal right to consultation.\n\nAdvertising helps fund Big Issue\u2019s mission to end poverty\n\nThis mirrors a Trade Union Congress suggestion. In their \u201cArtificial Intelligence (Regulation and Employment Rights) Bill\u201d \u2013 a draft bill they are calling for lawmakers to adopt \u2013 the union calls for enhanced regulatory powers and a guarantee of human involvement in \u201chigh-risk\u201d decisions.\n\nNever miss an issue Take advantage of our special New Year subscription offer. Subscribe from just \u00a39.99 and never miss an issue. Subscribe\n\n\u201cAI can be a liberator, and a public good, but only if a wide range of different people, not just commercial interests, have control over how this new technology is developed and used,\u201d the union urges.\n\nIncreased productivity could facilitate higher wages and reduced working hours, other reports suggest.\n\nThe TBI report points to the significant productivity gains that AI might bring. The technology could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, and by up to 6% by 2035. The IPPR echo this positivity regarding growth \u2013 but urge that the pursuit of growth should not come at the expense of workers.\n\n\u201cThese [tech firms] are some of the richest firms in the world. They are lobbying as much as oil and gas. There is a lack of democratic accountability,\u201d Desikan said.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for growth, but it\u2019s worrying what kind of compromises might be made in order to get that growth. So, I would say that the government has to be a little more skeptical, in a sense, not Luddite, but trying to address that lopsided balance.\u201d\n\nAdvertising helps fund Big Issue\u2019s mission to end poverty\n\nDo you have a story to tell or opinions to share about this?

        "text": "According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s recent Future of Jobs Report, 39% of workers\u2019 existing skillsets will become outdated by 2030 due to economic uncertainty, the rise of generative AI (genAI) and rapid technological change.\n\nSkillsets related to genAI, networks and cybersecurity, and technological literacy are now among the fastest growing and highest in-demand skills sought by employers.\n\nSeventy-three percent of employers prioritize hiring AI-skilled talent, yet three-quarters of them struggle to find the right candidates, according to one study commissioned by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It found that employers are willing to pay more for IT workers with genAI skills \u2014 on average, 47% more \u2014 and pay benefits extend across departments. Employers said that they would be willing to pay workers with AI skills a premium in sales and marketing (43% higher salary); finance (42% more); business operations (41% more); legal, regulatory, and compliance (37% more); and human resources (35% more).\n\nAWS has more than 600 online courses \u2014 many of them free \u2014 through which workers can become more familiar and certified in the uses of genAI technology and tools. And, not surprisingly, Amazon is dealing with many of the same issues, including worker fear of the unknown and concerns about what jobs will remain in the wake of genAI\u2019s advances.\n\nThe pace at which new courses are being devoured by technologists and business-side workers alike is unpreceded, according to Jenni Troutman, director of product and services for AWS training and certification. Among all AWS Certifications, the beta exam for AWS Certified AI Practitioner drew the largest number of participants \u2014 20 times the number of participants than the historical average for new beta courses. For the AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer Associate, the company saw a tripling of the number of beta participants compared to the past average.\n\nWhile AWS has been expanding its courses to help workers gain expertise and certification in genAI, it\u2019s also been forced to address internal concerns and anxiety around the technology\u2019s impact on jobs.\n\nTroutman said that as the technology and business marketplace quickly evolves, the traits that make a worker valuable are also changing. The need to understand how to use genAI, as well as the need for critical soft skills, is no longer a nice-to-have. It\u2019s a need-to-have.\n\nTroutman spoke with Computerworld about what skills are most needed by job seekers and the currently employed who want to keep their jobs or advance their careers.\n\nWhat do you see changing in terms of the type of skills and workers AWS itself is seeking? \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the same things our customers are talking about, which is, how do we get our workforce upskilled on just what AI is to begin with, and then how to use it in their day-to-day jobs.\n\n\u201cWe have our own internal efforts that are similar to the training we provide customers. We\u2019ve been running multiple internal campaigns on getting people to take the training, build the skills and get, at least \u2014 depending on their role \u2014 the certified AI practitioner certification, which is one we launched last year. It\u2019s meant for everyone to demonstrate fluency in AI and some basic understanding of AI and generative AI concepts, how you can benefit from them, and knowledge on the tools we provided.\n\n\u201cWe are driving change management-type efforts to get people comfortable using the tools that are provided, so anything from Amazon Q Developer to get our developers\u2019 productivity improved and free up time for two things: One, get more out there so we can build faster for customers, but also to get people [doing] higher quality code moving faster and just more productive in their day-to-day work.\n\n\u201cWe also have [business intelligence-type] tools internally where people are learning how to use AI. Another one is Amazon Q for Business \u2014 our business intelligence tool that looks across internal information, and you can use it to make yourself more productive.\n\n\u201cSo, we have been working on helping people understand what tools are out there, how they can use them, and then how they can think differently about what they can accomplish in their work over a period of time. And we incorporate that into our annual planning.\u201d\n\nWhat are you seeing in terms of accepting this kind of job change from employees? Are you getting any pushback? \u201cYeah. Frankly, we see all the same things as we see externally. We see people who are super excited and jump on it and are figuring out new ways of using the technology rapidly and then you see people who are skeptical, who are going to say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s not ready for me to use, yet. It\u2019s not really going to affect me and [will] take longer to come along.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is people that are in that place are starting to get nervous and realizing that people are serious [about this]. I think we\u2019re probably further ahead than a lot of users, because we build the technology ourselves, and so we need to be demonstrating that we\u2019re using it. So people are already realizing, \u2018If I\u2019m not figuring out how to use it, I\u2019m going to be in trouble, and it\u2019s going to be a risk for my career.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo, while there are still people who are slow to adopt it, I would say there\u2019s less of them and we\u2019re moving past the message of, \u2018It\u2019s not ready for me, or it\u2019s not relevant for me.\u2019 It\u2019s more of an, \u2018Oh, how I\u2019m getting nervous, and I need to start figuring out how to do it, but I\u2019m so busy that it feels like a lot to have to learn it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat are the skills requirements that are changing? \u201cA big one is prompt engineering. It\u2019s a term that puts people off if they\u2019re not technical. I think because you think of engineering as being technical, but really, it\u2019s sort of the term that we\u2019re using for how you get the output you need from a generative AI tool. It doesn\u2019t really matter your role. You need to understand how to write good prompts really be able to get the best benefit from the technology.\n\n\u201cLearning how to write good prompts is a skill in and of itself, and it\u2019s a new skill that most people don\u2019t have. So that is one where we focus a lot. Once you get the basics and understand what AI and generative AI is, then you need to learn prompt engineering, and there\u2019s a course on how to write good prompts. Then the second thing to learn is just thinking differently. It\u2019s really around the soft skills of being creative, trying new things, thinking critically.\n\n\u201cSo, if you try something out and it doesn\u2019t give you the result you wanted at first, being able to figure out why, and keep adapting your approach. And during that time, be collaborating with others to understand how other people are using the technology, which will help you think differently and come up with new ideas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in such early stages. While the technology itself been around a long time, widespread use hasn\u2019t been here for very long. It\u2019s really about the art of the possible and thinking differently about how to accomplish day-to-day things. I would say that is the biggest barrier, right now.\n\n\u201cAnd so, getting exposure to what other people are doing and being curious, reaching out and finding out is a skill in and of itself. We call it, \u2018learn and be curious.\u2019 It\u2019s a leadership principle of ours at Amazon. But in general, it\u2019s that curiosity of really being able to find out what other people are doing and then use that, not only to replicate it, but also to come up with new ideas yourself.\u201d\n\nWhat skills do you see are becoming outdated? \u201cIt\u2019s things that are\u2026repetitive. An example is an entry-level software developer, where they\u2019re mostly coding all the time. That pure practice of coding is going to become less and less relevant. It\u2019s going to be developers who are able to spend more time on thinking differently about what they\u2019re building, about how to create better applications, about better designs and architectures, which is a higher-level skill. And, they\u2019re going to have to take on a role more around the quality of code \u2014 the quality checking role \u2014 making sure that the code is doing what you want.\n\n\u201cAnd so it\u2019s those kind of more mid-tier and senior developers that are going to be where the demand is, and entry-level kind of coding is going to be a less relevant skill. So, we\u2019re really encouraging people that are more junior developers to get mentors and learn how to think bigger and move beyond pure coding to getting into design and new application development.\u201d\n\nIs generative AI really creating quality code? \u201cYes. If you use it correctly and it\u2019s dependent on the use case. So, there are use cases that it is phenomenal at it, and there are use cases where there\u2019s still some work for it to get there. But it will get there. It\u2019s getting better by the day.\n\n\u201cThe advances that are happening in the technology are happening so fast that things like Java migrations \u2014 that are more standardized \u2014 those [use cases] are incredible. The speed of acceleration and the quality of the work are tremendous. When you\u2019re talking about building something completely new from the beginning, then it takes someone who really understands how to do successful prompting, and they have more QA. But it\u2019s getting there. It\u2019s getting better and better.\u201d\n\nHow do you see software developer jobs changing? Are some entry-level jobs simply going away? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think we will need fewer people at those levels, or those at those levels will just become more advanced. Because what will happen is they won\u2019t need to spend as much time on coding. It will force them to learn new things so to either quickly adapt and focus time more on the actual problems that they\u2019re solving with their applications, or learn new skills and start to expand beyond core products, core software development \u2014 like core coding. They\u2019ll also be moving into specialty areas, like security areas, where we definitely need more people. And they are adjacent, so they can kind of branch into building skills in those areas.\u201d\n\nWhat new jobs are you seeing in the market that are being created by this shift? \u201cI see a lot of people being able to be more productive in their current jobs. I see a lot of expansion of roles, like machine learning engineers, big data specialists. We\u2019re needing more and more of those roles. They\u2019re not necessarily new roles, but they\u2019re roles where people tend to be highly skilled. We don\u2019t have a lot of them, and now we need a lot more of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what brand new roles we\u2019re going to have or need. I think we haven\u2019t figured it out yet, but what we are finding is that people in their current roles are operating in different ways and able to do a lot more [through genAI]. It\u2019s great, because you can be more creative and more innovative and get a lot more done. But it also can be scary for people because of how much more is this all going to change, and how fast and how many people are we going to need to do the work?\n\n\u201cAre we just going to keep getting more productive, or is there a point where we don\u2019t need as many people? And I think that\u2019s a big\u2026interesting question, because I think it\u2019s similar to when the internet came up. People could get stuff done so fast, and it was like, \u2018Yikes! We\u2019re not going to need nearly [as many workers] now.\u2019 But we certainly haven\u2019t seen the workforce shrink. So I don\u2019t think we will now, either. But it\u2019s hard to predict where we\u2019re going to go.\u201d\n\nBusinesses are now hiring tech talent across various departments, like finance, sales, marketing \u2014 and even business-side workers are becoming IT savvy. Are you seeing a rise in the business technologist? And what does that mean? \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call them business technologists, but yes, there\u2019s a rise in business people trying to understand AI and what it means for them, and we\u2019ve actually seen that with the launch of our AWS Certified AI Practitioner [course]. The demand for it has outpaced any previous certification we\u2019ve had by a factor of 9x from the beta launch of it. And it\u2019s been because of demand from both business people and technical people who are really just trying to figure out what is it all about and how can they use it in their day-to-day lives and jobs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing \u2014 that recognition that these new technologies that are coming out\u2026and they\u2019re kind of the future, and people have to figure out what this technology can do for them and their job, no matter what their job is.\n\n\u201cWe participated in a study\u2026around wages associated with AI skills, and what we found was just an incredible uplift in wage premiums for people in any role that have AI skills, or those who can demonstrate AI skills, including like above 30% wage premiums, even for people in HR, marketing, finance, stuff like that. And so, because of those roles, having such a high premium placed on having AI skills, people are realizing across the board that they need an understanding of the technology and a literacy around AI to be successful, no matter their role.\u201d\n\nWhat are the AI-related skills companies are seeking right now, and will those also change in the future? \u201cYes. So the big ones are around machine learning engineers. We also came out with an associate-level technical certification for machine learning engineers last year, because that one is a big high-growth area, as well as data specialists. So, people who know how to architect the data environments and who know how to structure the data all the way through to people who know how to use it, like business analysts to effectively leverage [business intelligence] tools. And, then also software engineers who understand AI and who can build applications that leverage the AI underlying the application. Those are some of the highest growth technical roles. And who knows for how long?\n\n\u201cI imagine those are going to be critical roles for quite a for quite a while, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be all kinds of new ones that come up in the next couple years that we can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d\n\nWhat are the steps workers and job seekers can take to gain in-demand tech skills that can future-proof their careers? \u201cI would say two things: One, I would start setting aside a time to do some kind of structured learning online. We offer that on AWS Skill Builder. Start taking some of the foundational courses. There\u2019s all kinds of free training out there: What is AI? What is generative AI? There\u2019s even a generative AI essentials course on there where you can just get the foundational concepts. I would start learning that now.\n\n\u201cAnd two, I would find what tools you either have access to at your company that are generative AI or go outside and start with Q Developer or other Q [courses], depending on your role, or even Q for Business, and start using the tools out there. Just play with them, understand what they can do. There\u2019s a great course around understanding the art of the possible for generative AI out on AWS Skill Builder.\n\n\u201cIt starts to give you a sense of how to think differently \u2014 what are people doing with it? Then just start playing with it and see what you can do. That curiosity, I think, is going to be the most critical skill or trait to keeping up with what\u2019s going on out there with AI. It\u2019s about having the curiosity to go out and play around and learn and just start using it in, even in personal stuff. You know, use it to craft a strongly worded email when you\u2019re frustrated with something that happened with your kids at school or to write your Christmas letter, or whatever it is that you even do in your personal life that takes time play around with it.\n\n\u201cSee what it can do, and you\u2019ll start to realize, both in your personal and professional life, how much there is that you can do with it.\u201d",

As AI models improve and the tools become more sophisticated, their range of abilities grows dramatically. The jobs most at risk involve routine tasks, where AI can easily step in to handle repetitive work more efficiently. Understanding the top 10 roles likely to be replaced by AI, why they\u2019re most vulnerable, and what it means for workers can help you make more informed decisions about your career and build the skills that will matter most in the future.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2022 Jobs in the manufacturing, healthcare, and customer service industries are most at risk of AI replacement because these sectors rely heavily on routine, repetitive tasks that can be automated. (Jump to Section)\n\n(Jump to Section) \u2022 Building skills that AI can\u2019t replace, investing in continuous learning, and staying adaptable are some of the steps you can take to prepare for an AI-driven job market. (Jump to Section)\n\n(Jump to Section) \u2022 Aside from job losses, the economic impacts of AI job replacement also include increased productivity and potential income inequality. (Jump to Section)\n\nTop 10 Jobs AI Will Replace\n\nThe table below shows an overview of what jobs will AI replace in the future, including the likelihood of AI replacing each role and the expected job growth by 2030. Most of these positions are projected to decline, with a few showing only minimal growth. Source: Will Robots Take My Job?\n\nData Entry Clerks\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 95%\n\nData entry clerks are at a high risk of being replaced by AI mainly because their work involves tedious, structured tasks that AI can automate easily. AI tools can quickly process large amounts of data with minimal errors, saving time and money for companies. With advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and optical character recognition (OCR), AI can manage unstructured data, like handwritten notes or scanned documents, more effectively. Since AI can do these tasks much faster, businesses are more likely to rely less on human data entry in the future.\n\nTelemarketers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 94%\n\nThis role is likely to be replaced by AI because the job focuses on following scripts and managing routine customer interactions, tasks that AI can now do just as well, if not faster. AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants can make calls, answer questions, and even personalize conversations based on customer data. Additionally, these tools are available 24/7, don\u2019t need breaks, and can handle multiple calls at once, making them a cost-effective alternative to human telemarketers.\n\nBookkeepers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 94%\n\nBookkeepers are at serious risk of being replaced by AI because their work is straightforward and repetitive\u2014exactly what AI tools are built for. AI-powered software can track expenses, reconcile accounts, and even generate financial reports more quickly and accurately than people can. These systems can also connect directly to bank accounts and other financial platforms, so there\u2019s no need for manual data entry. Businesses typically look for ways to cut costs and save time, making bookkeepers highly vulnerable to automation.\n\nReceptionists\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 92%\n\nReceptionists face a significant risk of being replaced by AI as automated systems like virtual assistants become capable of managing calls, scheduling and visitor check-ins. These AI tools save costs and complete routine tasks smoothly and without breaks. While human receptionists can build rapport and address complex issues, businesses might prioritize the round-the-clock availability of AI, especially when dealing with high volumes of routine inquiries.\n\nRetail Cashiers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 89%\n\nThe jobs of retail cashiers are increasingly at risk of AI replacement as self-checkout systems and automated payment technologies become more common. These systems let customers scan and pay for items on their own, eliminating the need for someone to operate a register. AI advances are also allowing stores to use the Just Walk Out technology, where sensors and cameras automatically charge customers for items as they leave. For companies, these AI solutions mean lower labor costs and accelerated checkout times.\n\nManufacturing Workers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 88%\n\nManufacturing jobs are under threat because AI and robotics can now take over many physical tasks. Machines can perform everything from assembling products to inspecting them, often with greater consistency than human workers. Automation is particularly useful for tasks requiring high precision or repeated movements, as robots don\u2019t tire and can be programmed to to work non-stop.\n\nBank Tellers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 88%\n\nBank tellers are facing a high chance of AI replacement due to the rise of digital banking and automated systems. With more customers using mobile banking apps and online platforms for everyday transactions, in-person banking becomes unnecessary. ATMs and self-service kiosks are also taking over basic tasks, like cash deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. These systems are not only quicker but also reduce the costs associated with maintaining a large, in-person staff.\n\nProofreaders\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 86%\n\nProofreading jobs are vulnerable to AI because many of their tasks can now be done by advanced editing software. AI-powered grammar checkers and style editors can spot errors in text faster than humans can, from typos to sentence structure issues. In addition, these programs are constantly updated to recognize more complex language patterns, making them a practical choice for companies looking to cut down on costs. Even though human editors will still be required for complex tasks, AI is steadily taking over more of the routine, error-catching work traditionally done by proofreaders.\n\nCustomer Service Representatives\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 80%\n\nCustomer service representatives are on the list of jobs AI will replace due to AI chatbots and virtual assistants growing more adept at managing routine inquiries, such as account updates and order tracking. These tools give businesses a cost-effective way to provide 24/7 support while handling requests simultaneously. However, human representatives may still be indispensable for emotionally charged situations where empathy is necessary.\n\nTranslators\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 71%\n\nTranslators are seeing their roles shift as AI-supported language tools become more sophisticated, processing text in real-time, translating accurately in dozens of languages. These tools are now able to pick upon context and tone, which were once areas where humans had the advantage. For routine tasks, like translating documents or basic conversations, AI can often do the job faster at little to no cost. Human translators might still be needed for highly nuanced or creative work, the demand for traditional translation services is likely to decrease as these technologies continue to develop.\n\nPreparing for an AI-Driven Job Market\n\nAI will continue to transform industries. Preparing for the changing job market is more important than ever. It\u2019s undeniable that AI will take over, if not eliminate, some jobs, but it will also create new opportunities. Developing a mix of new skills and a mindset that welcomes change will help you thrive in this environment. Here\u2019s what you can do to make yourself more valuable:\n\nWork on Skills AI Can\u2019t Replace: Automation can deal with routine tasks efficiently, but human traits, such as creativity and empathy, are irreplaceable. These skills will be even more valuable as routine work is automated. Focus on critical thinking, problem-solving, and building personal connections, areas where humans still have a distinct advantage.\n\nAutomation can deal with routine tasks efficiently, but human traits, such as creativity and empathy, are irreplaceable.

Workers who can pivot quickly and pick up new tools will be in demand as new roles will call for constant flexibility. Understand AI and Its Limitations: Because AI plays a large role in the workplace, it\u2019s imperative to understand both its strengths and limitations. While it\u2019s hard to beat at data processing because of its speed and accuracy, it struggles with complex decision-making and creativity. By recognizing these limitations, you can use AI tools effectively and concentrate on areas where human judgment remains essential.\n\nBecause AI plays a large role in the workplace, it\u2019s imperative to understand both its strengths and limitations.

By recognizing these limitations, you can use AI tools effectively and concentrate on areas where human judgment remains essential. Explore AI-Proof Jobs: If you\u2019re considering a career shift, explore roles that rely on human interaction, hands-on expertise, and skills that are difficult for machines to replicate. Professions like chefs and social workers need nuanced decision-making and emotional intelligence, which machines cannot duplicate. Pursuing these AI-proof jobs can offer stability in a future where automation seems unstoppable.\n\nThe Economic Impacts of AI Job Replacement\n\nAI continues to mold industries and job markets, and its economic impact goes far beyond job displacement. While the technology introduces substantial benefits, it also raises serious concerns about inequality, workforce transitions, and ethical implications.\n\nIncreased Productivity and Economic Expansion\n\nAI-driven automation is poised to boost productivity, contributing an estimated $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This expansion will primarily come from enhanced efficiency and increased consumer demand, with the healthcare, finance, and manufacturing sectors standing to benefit the most. The challenge, however, is making sure that this improvement is not limited to just a few industries or companies. If the benefits are concentrated in a small group, the broader economy could face widening inequality.\n\nJob Losses and Workforce Displacement\n\nAccording to SEO.AI, AI could potentially replace around 800 million jobs worldwide by 2030. Job losses are to be expected in various sectors, with automation replacing basic roles. Workers in manufacturing, retail, and customer service industries are particularly vulnerable. As AI takes over repetitive tasks, the shift in the workforce may cause disruptions and lead to retraining requirements for displaced workers.\n\nIncome Disparity\n\nAI is set to widen the income gap, especially in lower-wage sectors, like retail, food service, and manufacturing. A Brookings Institution report found that more than 30 percent of workers could see half of their tasks disrupted by generative AI. On the other hand, higher-paying, skilled positions in STEM, business, and finance industries are more likely to benefit from AI. Simply put, the economic gains from AI could disproportionately favor those with higher skills, leaving lower-income workers behind and making income inequality worse.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhich Industries Are Most Affected by AI? AI is having a major impact on the manufacturing, healthcare, and customer service industries by automating tasks that were previously done by humans. In manufacturing, automation replaces manual labor on production lines. In healthcare, AI is handling diagnostics and administrative tasks. Meanwhile, in customer service, AI chatbots manage routine support roles, reducing the need for human involvement in simple inquiries. Will AI Create More Jobs Than it Replaces? AI is expected to create new job opportunities, particularly in AI development, data analysis, and machine learning fields. These new roles usually come with competitive AI job salaries, reflecting the specialized skills necessary. That said, the number of AI careers may not fully offset the jobs lost to automation. The effect will depend on how industries adjust, with higher-paying roles in tech, but fewer traditional jobs in more automated industries. What Skills Are Needed to Work Alongside AI? To work alongside AI, you must gain skills in data analysis, machine learning, and critical thinking. You can also take AI-related courses or self-paced AI certifications to learn AI in detail. Developing these skills will help you collaborate with AI technologies in various sectors.\n\nConclusion: Navigating the AI-Driven Job Landscape\n\nThe job market is undergoing a significant transformation, and while some roles become obsolete or face automation, others are emerging in response to new demands. Adapting to this shift means focusing on continuous learning and cultivating skills that AI cannot easily duplicate. Invest in human-centric abilities and skills that would complement new technologies to remain relevant and resilient as the nature of work evolves.\n\nFind out which businesses are setting the new standards in AI by reading about the top AI companies and NLP companies.",

        "text": "AI is accelerating the rate of workplace change, according to a new report.\n\nPeople are now more than twice as likely to acquire AI skills than in 2018.\n\nParadoxically, the greater focus on technology also means human skills are more in demand.\n\nIn work, things change \u2013 and that pace of change is accelerating. Globally, more than 10% of workers hired today have job titles that didn\u2019t exist in 2000 (in the US, it\u2019s closer to 20%). As revealed in our just-released Work Change Report: AI Is Coming To Work, for companies, leaders, and professionals alike the workplace is almost unrecognizable compared to just one generation ago.\n\nFrom the growing influence of artificial intelligence on daily tasks and emerging skills, to the creation of new jobs, these trends are starting to redefine today\u2019s workplace.\n\nAs businesses pivot to address trends such as technological innovation and shifting demographics, leaders are mobilizing their workforces to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing environment. At the same time, professionals are responding to these changes, often by upskilling, reskilling, or pursuing entirely new career paths.\n\nThe journey will look vastly different for those entering the workforce today than it did 15 years ago. Professionals are likely to hold twice as many jobs throughout their careers compared to their predecessors: That\u2019s 20 jobs now versus 11 in 2010. While these changes present unique challenges for businesses, such as talent retention and ongoing upskilling, they also create new opportunities for innovation and job market dynamism.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into exactly how work is changing in the emerging age of AI:\n\nAI skills are everywhere: Today, people are more than twice as likely to add AI skills than in 2018. Even occupations that were less likely to see the value of AI skills \u2013 for example, recruiters, marketers, sellers and healthcare professionals \u2013 are now seven times more likely to add AI skills than just six years ago. Additionally, AI literacy skills are a key differentiator for job seekers: Professionals who embrace AI will get ahead of the competition and effectively set themselves up for long-term career success. Hiring managers are clued in, with more than half saying they wouldn\u2019t hire someone without AI literacy skills. In fact, while only one in 500 jobs on LinkedIn list AI literacy skills, it's not surprising that demand for these types of skills have increased more than sixfold in the past year.\n\nHave you read? Why it\u2019s time to revisit the value and meaning of work in the age of AI\n\nWorkers are broadening their skillset: Globally, professionals today are adding a 40% broader skillset to their profiles than they did in 2018. And it\u2019s not just professionals: Companies and leaders are starting to understand the importance of upskilling their teams on AI. AI literacy skills, like prompt engineering and proficiency with tools like ChatGPT or Copilot, are just as important. Since 2023, the number of AI literacy skills added by LinkedIn members has increased by 177%.\n\nSoft skills are increasingly important: In roles that were once less likely to value human skills, the importance of these specific skills has grown by 20% since 2018. As organizations come to grasp the full extent of what AI can do, they\u2019re also coming to terms with all that it can\u2019t do \u2013 those tasks that require the uniquely human skills that all businesses need.\n\nToday\u2019s workplace evolution is pushing executives and employees alike to rethink how they work. While the accelerated pace of change relative to prior technological shifts can feel daunting, it also opens the door to significant opportunities for those who are proactive in adapting and building new capabilities.",

        "text": "AI will spark a massive reshuffling of the job market, labor experts say.\n\nResearchers predict AI will displace as many as 12 million workers through the end of the decade.\n\nThose workers could have trouble pivoting to a new career if they don't adjust their skillset, career experts say.\n\nThe days of casual job-hopping may be coming to an end.\n\nAI is about to make it a lot harder to get a new gig, especially for people working in industries that are highly exposed to AI disruption, career experts told Business Insider.\n\nThe advent of AI is a big warning for customer service reps, cashiers, office assistants, and production workers. \"Medium-skilled\" workers are the most likely to be displaced by the technology, according to Georgios Petropoulos, a labor market and digital tech researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nWhile high-skilled workers are more likely to implement AI into their existing jobs, and trade workers like plumbers and electricians will see continued demand for services, Petropoulos predicts that medium-skilled workers will be in limbo over the next few decades as AI becomes more mainstream.\n\n\"We see a higher polarization of the job market,\" Petropoulos told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nThough he didn't have an exact estimate, Petropoulos expects higher unemployment among medium-skilled workers as the economy transitions to an AI-run job market. That transition could take as long as 20 years, he added.\n\n\"We'll have more high-skilled jobs, more low-skilled jobs, and the middle that drops.\"\n\nKweilin Ellingrud, a director at the McKinsey Global Institute, anticipates lower-skilled labor to be in less demand as the effects of AI ripple across the US job market. By 2030, McKinsey estimates 12 million workers will need to find different careers altogether, about the same amount of job-switching that took place during the pandemic.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the economy could lose 630,000 cashiers, 710,000 administrative assistants, and 830,000 salespeople, McKinsey estimates. The number of clerks across all industries could plummet by 1.6 million, the firm said in a report last year.\n\n\"The typical job will require a higher level of skills than it did before,\" Ellingrud said of increased competition in the job market. \"The simpler work, the more repetitive work that can easily be done by a machine or now a generative AI model, is going to be done by that model.\"\n\nA split job market\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence is largely expected to boost productivity and add more jobs to the economy, but job gains largely lie in areas like healthcare and STEM fields, the McKinsey report found.\n\nMeanwhile, employers outside those areas are already beginning to raise their standards of who they might bring on board. 66% of business leaders say they won't consider someone who doesn't know how to use AI, and 71% report they would prefer a job candidate with less experience and AI knowledge, according to a May survey conducted by Microsoft and LinkedIn.\n\nThat's left employees feeling the pressure to level up and make themselves more competitive in the eyes of prospective employers.\n\nDemand for Gen AI courses has soared 1,060% this year on the online learning platform Coursera. It's the equivalent of someone signing up for an AI-related course every 15 seconds, according to Coursera CEO Jeff Maggioncalda.\n\n\"Will it make the labor market more competitive? It absolutely is already,\" Maggioncalda told BI, noting that workers who don't upskill will have trouble in the job market.\n\nCoursera is also putting an emphasis on AI among its employees, Maggioncalda noted. The company now requires some of its workers to take mandatory AI skill classes.\n\n\"I often will tell my employees, it looks like you did not actually work with GPT to create this presentation or to write this piece. Run it through the model and sharpen your thinking. It's just not clear enough. My expectation for speed and clarity of thinking is much higher than it was two years ago,\" Maggioncalda added. \"I don't think that there'll be much of a safety net for someone who is, say, a knowledge worker who didn't really learn AI. They lose their job.\"\n\nIt could take years for a worker displaced by AI to retrain and make themselves more competitive in a job market more heavily integrated with AI, Ellingrud speculates. On average, she thinks workers will need three to five years to adjust to the new employment landscape.\n\n\"I think workers of tomorrow will need to be more flexible than 10 years ago, and that's primarily because of all this occupational transition,\" she said. \"So you might not want to learn a particular skill or get excited about that, but being flexible to shift to a different occupation, I think will be required more in the future than it was in the past.\"",

        "text": "The Dutch labor market is strong and evolving: labor force participation is notably high, and unemployment levels are historically low. But ongoing trends, including an aging population and declining productivity growth, are putting the labor market under pressure. Recently, McKinsey projected that labor market tightness could triple by 2030 if the Netherlands maintains current levels of growth in GDP (1.6 percent CAGR) and productivity (0.4 percent CAGR).\n\nAbout the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Ashley van Heteren, Eva Beekman, and Ferry Grijpink, with Just van der Wolf and Wouter Kokx, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Amsterdam office.\n\nWhile traditional automation solutions to increase labor productivity, such as document processing systems, have played a significant role in addressing this challenge, most have been limited to processing structured data. Generative AI (gen AI), however, unlocks a new domain of automation with its ability to process unstructured data such as natural language and images. It therefore broadens the spectrum of automation potential to more occupations, including knowledge work and customer service, and holds the potential to boost productivity and economic growth for the Netherlands.\n\nFollowing the base case scenario of automation of current activities (\u201cslower scenario\u201d) from a recent McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report on the future of work in Europe, we estimate that automation will likely affect 15 percent of total full-time-equivalent work hours in the Netherlands by 2030\u2014a 50 percent increase over a scenario without gen AI. This represents a significant opportunity for Dutch businesses to tackle the challenges posed by the evolving and tight labor market, especially in areas in which increased automation can help relieve labor shortages. However, a wide deployment of gen AI is expected to require extensive re- and upskilling programs, including for jobs that were previously unaffected by automation. It may also require regulation to mitigate its potential risks, such as data privacy, intellectual property risk, and fairness.\n\nIn this article, we focus on how gen AI can influence the future of work in the Netherlands across sectors and organizations. We discuss how expected adoption speed varies by sector and by sector composition in terms of shares of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), independents, and corporations. We also explore actions public and private leaders could take to accelerate gen AI adoption in the Netherlands. This perspective takes a longer-term view of the singular effects that might be directly brought about by gen AI; it does not forecast aggregated employment effects that can be brought about by the business cycle in the short term.\n\nGen AI creates new opportunities spanning sectors and organizations\n\nThe introduction of gen AI and the public breakthrough of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in late 2022 have accelerated the automation potential of activities that involve communication, documentation, or interaction with people. Gen AI\u2014in particular, applications that are open or that use publicly available data\u2014has also become available to a wider group of organizations. The range of work activities suitable for automation has expanded to include those requiring subject matter expertise, interpersonal interaction, and creativity. Consequently, the timeline for automation adoption could accelerate significantly, reaching previously unaffected jobs, such as those in professional services.\n\nOur modeling suggests that even in the \u201cslower scenario,\u201d adoption of gen AI could reduce the total number of hours needed to perform current workforce activities by 15 percent (Exhibit 1; see sidebar, \u201cMethodology\u201d). Of course, the exact automation path for gen AI is subject to considerable uncertainty. The extent to which this potential is realized will depend on the ability of Dutch companies to innovate, the capability of workers to re- and upskill, and the support of policy makers.\n\nIn the rest of this section, we dig into the precise factors affecting uptake as well as the sectors in which gen AI has the most promise for addressing labor market challenges.\n\nImpact from gen AI will depend on sector composition\n\nWhile our models reveal potential for gen AI to relieve labor market tensions, we also acknowledge the challenges involved in gen AI reaching its full potential in the Netherlands.\n\nNot all Dutch businesses are preparing to adopt analytical AI (that is, AI methods preceding generative AI). AWVN (General Employers Association of the Netherlands) reported that 40 percent of Dutch companies are not yet using AI in their businesses because of a lack of knowledge, safety and privacy concerns, or perceived irrelevance. This finding illustrates the types of challenges the Netherlands may face in rapidly adopting gen AI technologies.\n\nThe speed of gen AI adoption at a country level is determined by multiple factors, including the economic maturity of a country, overall sector readiness to embrace new technologies, and crucially, sector composition in terms of shares of SMEs, independents, and corporations (Exhibit 2). A relatively high percentage of workers in the Netherlands (about 65 percent) are employed by SMEs, compared with 57 percent in Germany, 54 percent in the United Kingdom, 52 percent in France, and 46 percent in the United States. Sectors dominated by small companies might be slower to embrace new automation opportunities. For example, when it came to adoption of digital sales technologies, in 2019, the top 10 percent of largest companies captured 60 to 95 percent of digital revenues. This is expected to affect the rate and speed at which gen AI might accelerate automation in the Netherlands.\n\nLarge companies in the Netherlands are adopting analytical AI technologies faster than smaller companies. Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS) reported in 2020 that 48 percent of companies with 500 or more employees were using one or more AI technologies, compared with only 8 to 13 percent for companies with ten to 50 employees.\n\nAs with the adoption of analytical AI, the smaller-company archetype could capture impact from gen AI more slowly in the next five years for the following three reasons:\n\nLimited investment capacity. Smaller companies usually have lower investment capacity, constraining their ability to acquire new capabilities, tools, or resources. For example, Dutch SMEs invest about 1 percent of profits in R&D compared with about 5 percent for larger companies. They might lack the scale to manage these solutions systematically, such as keeping marketing content generator inputs up to date. However, many gen AI solutions\u2014especially those integrated in existing software packages such as Adobe and Microsoft Office\u2014are already available for many SMEs.\n\nLower up- and reskilling capabilities. Introducing gen AI tools into existing operating models requires significant change management of IT-related processes, including upskilling and reskilling programs to help employees use gen AI tools effectively. Smaller companies often lack the scale to benefit from designing and running such programs and are half as likely to provide formal upskilling programs compared with large corporates. Rather than formal in-person training programs, these organizations might rely more on digital and self-organized training, which could provide a less effective learning environment.\n\nLess robust existing data and infrastructure. The low-complexity technological landscapes of smaller companies typically do not justify extensive investment. Consequently, the technology is generally less mature, and existing data and infrastructure are generally less available. SMEs may, for example, use customer databases manually and not directly link databases to marketing and sales systems. All of this limits the pace at which gen AI solutions can be integrated with existing systems and data.\n\nChallenges to automation adoption are not equal for all sectors in the Netherlands, because the share of SMEs varies widely across sectors (Exhibit 3). For example, the agriculture sector could potentially benefit from using analytical AI and gen AI to improve efficiency for farms and agriculture companies, such as by improving on-farm decision making with camera images. However, the high percentage of independent and smaller companies in the sector along with factors such as plot size or specific legislation has thus far led to lower adoption of automation. In fact, McKinsey research shows that only 33 percent of Dutch farmers, who farm on smaller plots than farmers in neighboring countries, use at least one agricultural technology, compared with 45 percent in Germany and 51 percent in France.\n\nAdditionally, we expect that the public sector will experience slower adoption of gen AI. While most subsectors in the public sector have a high share of enterprises with more than 500 employees (about 50 to 80 percent in government, healthcare, and education) and may have more scale to enable gen AI upskilling, public acceptance and different regulatory requirements can potentially slow the adoption of gen AI in this domain. McKinsey research also shows that the overall investment in analytical and gen AI is lower in public sectors than in other sectors.\n\nGen AI holds the greatest potential to address Dutch labor market challenges in five sectors\n\nAlthough various interventions can address labor market challenges, our models show that gen AI can be a major productivity booster, particularly in a handful of sectors (Exhibit 4). A previous McKinsey report, Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that works, estimated that roughly one-third of the necessary productivity improvements to address labor market tightness in the Netherlands can be achieved through automation powered by gen AI.\n\nWhile gen AI is a game changer in speeding up automation for some sectors, implementing this technology may face delays due to sector nature and composition. Sectors may require varying levels of innovation orchestration and support to see positive results.\n\nThis orchestration could include four elements. The first, raising awareness, could involve helping sectors understand relevant high-impact gen AI use cases and their feasibility. Next, technology such as cost-effective, scalable, and secure gen AI solutions should be available, along with support for AI literacy training. Third, support to establish pilots and measure impact on labor tightness could serve as proof points for broader adoption and scaling. Last, cross-sector partnerships could be established to scale impact, pool funding, and share knowledge\u2014for instance, across public sector, industry, and educational institutions. Below, we explore five sectors with high potential for gen AI automation impact: finance and insurance; IT; administrative and support and government; educational services; and professional, scientific, and technical services.\n\nTwo sectors likely to self-propel adoption of gen AI\n\nThe finance and insurance sector and the IT sector have the highest potential for gen AI automation and some of the highest labor market tension. Gen AI innovation in these sectors will enhance their productivity. This, combined with their higher share of large corporations and large SMEs (approximately 50 percent of all businesses), provides business incentives and scale to encourage adoption without significant orchestration.\n\nThe finance and insurance sector is expected to adopt gen AI because of strong commercial incentives to substantially automate operations and address labor shortages. This sector stands to benefit significantly from gen AI tools, particularly in automating daily tasks, and its high level of digitalization can facilitate the integration of gen AI into primary processes and technology development. For example, ING partnered with McKinsey to develop and deploy a gen AI\u2013powered chatbot. Gen AI can also speed up credit and underwriting applications by automating document and image processing and generating credit memos.\n\nThe IT sector can benefit greatly from gen AI\u2019s ability to automate and accelerate software development processes. Gen AI\u2013powered coding assistance, automated testing, and intelligent architecture-design recommendations help IT companies speed up feature delivery and reduce time to market. AFAS, for example, has developed an API integration with OpenAI, giving companies access to advanced AI models for generating business information. This helps automate tasks such as reporting, business data analysis, and document creation. Gen AI can help minimize incident and problem resolution times by creating tighter feedback loops, linking user behaviors to feature changes, and collecting real-time feedback. Delft University of Technology\u2019s AI for Software Engineering Lab (AI4SE) explores these opportunities.\n\nOrchestration can accelerate gen AI adoption in three additional sectors\n\nOur models suggest that most sectors would benefit from orchestration to accelerate gen AI adoption, including the public sector and sectors with a higher share of smaller companies. Here we explore three sectors that will likely require orchestration for gen AI adoption and where the potential for gen AI impact is highest\u2014including the administrative and support and government sector, the educational services sector, and the professional, scientific, and technical services sector.\n\nIn the administrative and support and government sector, many traditional tasks are highly suited for automation using gen AI, such as case handling and call center operation. In educational services, early gen AI applications already focus on adaptive tutoring and service chatbots. These tools can enhance learning experiences and alleviate labor shortages by supplementing teacher-led instruction. However, both of these subsectors are in the public sector and are expected to adopt gen AI more slowly, as discussed above. In some cases, however, the government has played a leading role in accelerating adoption to enhance service delivery and support. For example, in the administrative and support and government sector, Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) launched AskSenna, an AI-driven tool designed to assist start-ups and early-stage companies by providing instant answers to regulatory and business-related queries.\n\nIn the professional, scientific, and technical services sector, including consulting, solutions are being developed to use gen AI for advanced search, synthesis tasks, and virtual coaching. However, given the high percentage of independents and SMEs in the sector (80 percent), we expect slower holistic adoption of gen AI solutions and therefore a slower impact on labor tightness. This sector may benefit from orchestration that is particularly targeted to help smaller enterprises understand the specific applications of gen AI relevant to their business, learn approaches to successfully implement those applications, and improve AI literacy.\n\nGen AI will create new roles and occupational categories\n\nAs gen AI becomes increasingly integrated into various sectors, the demand for specialized skills and expertise in AI is expected to grow. For example, we expect increased demand in three occupational categories in the Dutch labor market:\n\nGen AI practitioners. Gen AI specialists\u2014including prompt and agent engineers or AI content auditors\u2014form a new subexpertise within the AI playing field. Globally, these roles have grown rapidly across sectors that implement gen AI in their daily practice, especially in IT functions. Additionally, the surge in gen AI will drive demand for related software and data engineering support. For example, the Dutch company Weaviate helps companies structure their data to facilitate the development of gen AI use cases.\n\nGen AI researchers. Gen AI has created new opportunities in research positions, within both academia and enterprises. For instance, Philips is developing gen AI applications to improve clinical decisions, diagnosis, and workflow. The Dutch start-up Cradle uses gen AI to predict protein properties that could accelerate vaccine development.\n\nSemiconductor, software, and other engineers. As gen AI continues to grow, semiconductor-related jobs that enable this technology will likewise expand, including semiconductor engineers to provide computing power, software engineers to build front-end solutions, and a wide range of other roles. This presents an opportunity for the Dutch semiconductor industry, and companies such as ASML, ASM, Besi, and NXP Semiconductors are positioned to grow substantially because of the expected increase in semiconductor demand driven by the growth of end applications including gen AI. For example, in April 2024, ASML and the local municipality Eindhoven signed a letter of intent to expand ASML\u2019s facilities to accommodate an additional 20,000 employees\u2014a 50 percent increase in growth, which could be partly driven by gen AI.\n\nWe have previously emphasized the importance of developing soft and hard skills to keep pace and enable career advancement. This ongoing development can enhance productivity in current positions and prepare individuals for the high-demand jobs created by and for gen AI.\n\nThree moves could accelerate gen AI adoption and manage its effect on the Dutch workforce\n\nThree actions by public and private stakeholders could accelerate gen AI adoption in the Netherlands and will likely have a positive effect on the Dutch workforce.\n\nPreparing for granular upskilling and reskilling needs\n\nIncreased automation requires upskilling workers to use new gen AI tools\u2014monitoring service chatbots or using copilots to write marketing content, for example. Companies will need to develop training programs as these solutions are implemented. And because demand for some professions may decline, workers may need to reskill, sometimes across sectors. This would necessitate greater orchestration. The public sector could facilitate this process\u2014for example, as Techniek Nederland has been doing since 2013 by reskilling individuals from various backgrounds to become installation engineers.\n\nGranular insights such as regional job gain and loss analysis are crucial to understand a company\u2019s reskilling needs and make informed decisions. To assist Dutch businesses in identifying their automation potential and its workforce impact, public sector agencies and businesses could consider developing tools that map different job types to their expected automation potential. Such tools could provide businesses and local governments with valuable insights and guidance for transitioning to gen AI\u2013driven processes, helping them make informed decisions and support employees throughout their journey.\n\nOrchestrating sectors with high degrees of SMEs and labor tightness\n\nIn private sectors such as the professional, scientific, and technical services sector, in which both automation potential through gen AI and the proportion of SMEs are high, orchestration can accelerate gen AI implementation. Larger tech corporations, universities, public sector agencies such as UWV, and sectoral employer organizations could potentially facilitate this.\n\nFurthermore, Dutch companies of all sizes have opportunities to engage in the gen AI\u2013based automation market. For example, banks could collaborate with AI or software companies to create specific propositions or loans for gen AI development and help disseminate these throughout the sector. The Nederlandse AI Coalitie (NL AIC), a public\u2013private partnership, aims to promote the adoption and ethical use of AI technologies across sectors.\n\nMaking bold investments to lead the Netherlands\u2019 gen AI transition\n\nStrategic investments by both public and private organizations could accelerate the adoption of gen AI and alleviate labor shortages in the Netherlands. Such funding for long-term innovation will be crucial, especially in sectors that are strategically important to the economy, such as manufacturing (including the semiconductor industry), healthcare, construction, and education. For example, NFI, SURF, and TNO have received \u20ac13.5 million to develop a Dutch gen AI model that could accelerate development and adoption across sectors.\n\nThe Netherlands already hosts a few AI funds, such as NL AIC for responsible AI, AI growth fund AiNed, the Nationaal Onderwijslab AI (National Education Lab AI) established by Radboud University for AI in education, and the Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence. In the private sector, many large corporations are investing significantly in developing innovative technology. For example, ASML and Philips launched DeepTechXL, a private investment fund to finance and guide high-tech start-ups.\n\nBy embracing collaboration on cutting-edge technology opportunities such as gen AI, the Netherlands can position itself to build an increasingly thriving business ecosystem. A proactive approach can accelerate innovation and economic growth as well as ensure the workforce is well prepared to adapt to the changing landscape and flourish in a future shaped by AI.",

        "text": "Data science is still among the best careers to choose from in terms of compensation, with data scientists earning higher than the average salary. Let\u2019s see what data professionals stand to earn in 2025.\n\n\n\nImage by Author\n\n\n\nData science is among the best careers to choose from in terms of compensation, but a lot happened in 2024. This year has experienced massive layoffs even from tech giants. As of October 2024, there have been over 476 tech companies that have laid off over 141,467 employees, this according to Layoffs.fyi.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we combine this figure with that of 2023, over 428,229 people working in tech have been laid off. Aside from companies trying to cut down on high interest rates, over-hiring, etc., one major factor that has led to this massive layoff is artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI is eating deep into the tech job market, as many companies are hiring in favor of employees with AI-related skills and prior knowledge of how to use AI tools and applications. A McKinsey report in June 2023 stated that generative AI would automate 60% to 70% of employee workloads. Even with all of this happening, the data science field is still experiencing growth, and in return, this affects the salaries of employees working in these companies.\n\nThe Evolution of Data Science as a Career Path\n\n\n\nData science has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past few decades, evolving from a niche specialization to one of the most sought-after career paths in the modern job market. This evolution is closely tied to technological advancements, and the explosion of data, with professionals in this field originally primarily statisticians or analysts working with structured data sets to generate insights for businesses. However, as the volume and complexity of data exploded with the advent of the internet and digital technologies, the need for more advanced tools and techniques gave rise to the interdisciplinary field we now recognize as modern data science.\n\nFast-forward to the 2010s, data science had matured into a distinct profession fueled by advancements in machine learning, cloud computing, and big data technologies. Now companies have realized that harnessing unstructured data such as images, videos, and social media activity could provide them with a competitive edge. As a result, roles such as data engineer and machine learning engineer emerged, addressing different aspects of the data pipeline.\n\nWhy Salaries and Job Trends in Data Science Matter\n\n\n\nUnderstanding salaries and job trends in data science is essential for multiple reasons both for professionals in the field and organizations looking to leverage data-driven insights. Here's why this topic holds significant importance.\n\nFor Professionals: Career Planning and Growth\n\nInformed Decision-Making: Knowing current salary benchmarks helps data science professionals evaluate job offers, negotiate better pay, and plan career moves strategically.\n\nSkill Investment: Salary trends often reflect the value of specific skills. For instance, expertise in machine learning, AI, or cloud computing might command higher compensation, guiding professionals on where to focus their upskilling efforts.\n\nCareer Security: Staying updated on job market demands ensures individuals remain relevant and competitive, particularly as automation and AI begin to influence traditional roles.\n\nFor Organizations: Attracting and Retaining Talent\n\nCompetitive Hiring: With data scientists in high demand, offering market-aligned salaries is critical to attracting top talent and maintaining a competitive edge.\n\nTalent Retention: Organizations that understand evolving trends can build more effective retention strategies by addressing employees' expectations and career aspirations.\n\nResource Allocation: Insights into salary trends help businesses budget appropriately for growing data teams and allocate resources for upskilling existing employees.\n\nFor the Industry: Navigating Rapid Change\n\nImpact of Emerging Technologies: As fields like generative AI, edge computing, and advanced analytics grow, understanding job trends helps industries prepare for shifts in the types of roles needed.\n\nGlobal Workforce Trends: The rise of remote work and globalization has changed how salaries are structured across regions, making it crucial to analyze these dynamics for better workforce planning.\n\nFor Aspiring Data Scientists: Setting Realistic Expectations\n\nAwareness of Entry-Level Opportunities: Knowledge of salary ranges at different experience levels helps newcomers set realistic goals and avoid undervaluing themselves.\n\nIdentifying High-Growth Areas: Trends highlight industries or geographies with higher demand, guiding aspiring professionals on where to focus their job search.\n\nData Science Salaries\n\n\n\nDrawing data from reliable sources like Glassdoor, Indeed, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), it is clear that data scientists earn higher than the average salary, which ranges from $74,000 to $185,000 per annum. It is important to note that this salary varies based on location, industry, education, and experience level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData science salaries as reported by different reliable sources\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s break down and analyze the data by the following categories:\n\nData Science Salaries by Industry Data Science Salaries by Experience Level Data Science Salaries by Education Data Science Salaries by Location\n\n1. Data Science Salaries by Industry\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will group the industries into three distinct industries: high-paying, mid-range, and low-paying industries. Naturally, this comparison is not all-inclusive. There are many different sectors, and the differences within them are as great as those between them. But, this provides us with a decent sense of the variety we may anticipate across other industries.\n\nHigh Midrange (where most companies fall) Low Telecommunications\n\n$162,990 Government and administration\n\n$156,801 Agriculture\n\n$135,877 Information technology\n\n$161,146 Management and consulting\n\n$156,799 Personal consumer services\n\n$134,779 Insurance\n\n$160,565 Arts, entertainment, and recreation\n\n$156,793 Legal\n\n$131,427 Financial services\n\n$158,033 Healthcare\n\n$147,041 Manufacturing\n\n$121,285\n\n2. Data Science Salaries by Experience Level\n\n\n\nAn entry-level data scientist typically makes $117,276 annually. It goes without saying that your income will increase as your profession advances.\n\nBased on years of experience, Glassdoor has estimated the median yearly total compensation for data scientists in the US as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian yearly total compensation for data scientists in the US by years of experience (Glassdoor)\n\n\n\n0-1 years: $117,276\n\n1-3 years: $128,403\n\n4-6 years: $141,390\n\n7-9 years: $152,966\n\n10-14 years: $166,818\n\n15+ years: $189,884\n\n3. Data Science Salaries by Education\n\n\n\nAccording to Zippia, a data scientist with a bachelor's degree makes, on average, $101,455 per year, while a data scientist with a master's degree makes, on average, $109,454. This suggests that when you pursue further schooling, your pay as a data scientist will rise. The exact amount will obviously vary and depend on other factors, but the basic correlation holds.\n\nThis shouldn't come as a surprise. Employees with advanced degrees typically make more money because it demonstrates to companies that you have the initial experience they want.

        "text": "The demand for AI jobs has been skyrocketing in recent times, with many flocking to get careers in the field.\n\nThis much seems to be true in Singapore, where the government is planning a S$1 billion investment to strengthen AI capabilities.\n\nAccording to hiring and matching platform Indeed, searches for AI jobs on its site has increased by nearly 150% from March 2018 to March 2023, a July 11 press release announced.\n\nHowever, are the talent and necessary skills really there to fulfil the AI jobs available in the market? Here\u2019s what Indeed shared are the most in-demand skills in the field.\n\n1. Machine Learning\n\nIndeed\u2019s data shows that 61% of generative AI jobs in Singapore mention \u201cmachine learning\u201d.\n\nMachine learning refers to the field in AI that deals with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.\n\nIn simpler terms, it\u2019s all about enabling AI to imitate the way that humans learn.\n\nTo upskill in this area, there are courses online on Coursera by companies like IBM and institutions like Stanford.\n\n2. Proficiency in Python\n\nThe most popular progamming language sought after in the world of AI seems to be Python, with over half (54%) of the generative AI jobs asking for Python skills on Indeed.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Python is a general-purpose coding language that is built on the philosophy of code readability.\n\nIt\u2019s considered a beginner-friendly programming language, with many platforms such as Codecademy and datacamp offering courses.\n\n3. Expertise in PyTorch and C++\n\nProficiency in PyTorch is rather sought after too, appearing in 24% of job ads.\n\nAs NVIDIA put it, PyTorch is a fully featured framework for building deep learning models, which is a type of machine learning.\n\nIts primary interface is on the Python language as well as something called the Torch library, an open-source machine learning library.\n\nIt can also be used with the C++ programming language, which is mentioned by 23% of job ads.\n\nThere are resources online such as PyTorch.org and learnpytorch.io that talk all about PyTorch.\n\n4. Deep learning\n\n19% of job listings on its site mentioned deep learning, Indeed reported.\n\nDeep learning is rather similar to machine learning. Explaining the difference, Google Cloud states that machine learning is more explicitly used as a means to extract knowledge from data through simpler methods such as decision trees or linear regression.\n\nMeanwhile, deep learning uses the more advanced methods found in artificial neural networks.\n\nIBM has a page dedicated to sharing about the basics of deep learning. There\u2019s also a website called DeepLearning.AI founded in 2017 that may be helpful, too.\n\nFluency in various programming languages\n\nJust like with any languages, having fluency in many various programming languages will get you a leg up in the industry.\n\nIndeed broke down the mentions of programming languages in AI job ads as such:\n\nJava: 18%\n\nC: 13%\n\nSQL: 12%\n\nSpark: 11%\n\nLinux: 10%\n\nAs Callam Pickering, Senior Economist at Indeed APAC, said, \u201cAs AI becomes crucial across industries, there\u2019s a growing need for these skills. This data helps recruiters target specific skills and helps job seekers stay competitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cSingaporean businesses are facing a shortage of talent, with intense competition driven by AI,\u201d he added. \u201cRecruiters need to prioritise hiring for AI skills to keep up with the demand and ensure they don\u2019t fall behind in leveraging Singapore\u2019s AI growth.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Indeed here.\n\nRead other articles we\u2019ve written about AI here.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Patrick Amoy via Unsplash",

The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently released its Future of Jobs Report 2025 which states that while 92 million jobs are set to be displaced, 170 million new jobs will be created globally.\n\nAt a time when companies are rapidly adopting AI, it is important for professionals to stay updated with relevant skills in this ever-changing job market.\n\nAs India is navigating this transformative phase of the global labour market, the report by WEF offers a glimpse of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. For now technology, sustainability, and demographic changes are shaping industries, making it critical for the Indian workforce to adapt to the new trends. In this article, we will examine the job roles that will be in demand based on the Future of Jobs Report 2025.\n\nBefore we head to the jobs that will dominate in the near future, we need to understand how the demand for skills will change. According to the report, 39 per cent of the current skills are likely to become outdated by 2030. As many as 85 per cent of employers plan to priortise reskilling their workforce and 59 per cent of workers globally will require training by 2030.\n\nGoing forward, analytical thinking is likely to be the most sought-after skill and this will be followed by resilience, flexibility, and agility. The report says that technology-related skills such as AI, big data, and cybersecurity are among the fastest growing skills.\n\nBelow is a table highlighting some of the fastest-growing job roles:\n\nCategory Top Roles Technology AI and machine learning specialists, big data specialists, software and application developers, Internet of Things specialists, UI/UX designers Green transition Renewable energy engineers, environmental engineers, autonomous and electric vehicle epecialists Care economy Nursing professionals, social work and counselling professionals Education Secondary and tertiary education teachers Delivery and logistics Light truck or delivery dervices drivers, dupply chain and logistics specialists According to the report, the increasing adoption of generative AI, green technologies, and automation is driving the demand for most of these roles. This also indicates a fusion of technological and environmental ethos among companies going forward. Story continues below this ad What trends are shaping the Indian job market? India\u2019s demographic dividend is a key factor in the trends that shape the country\u2019s job market. Since India\u2019s working-age population is growing at a rapid pace, there is a significant demographic advantage. As per the report, the younger workforce can accelerate economic growth if they have access to the right skilling and job opportunities. Perhaps this is why companies are emphasising reskilling and upskilling to capitalise on this demographic shift. Based on trends, the best way to stay ahead is by upskilling oneself in the most relevant technology. (Image: FreePik) Based on trends, the best way to stay ahead is by upskilling oneself in the most relevant technology. (Image: FreePik) The adoption of AI and automation is rapidly transforming IT, healthcare, and manufacturing industries. The report mentions that generative AI is already a buzzword in India, and it is expected to empower workers across job roles by reducing technical barriers and allowing higher productivity. According to the report, corporate-sponsored training programmes in AI are gaining popularity, showing how businesses are working on workplace-ready AI applications. Also Read | 5 AI tools that helped me navigate work in 2024 The report also highlights how India\u2019s commitment to sustainability is driving job growth in renewable energy and environmental sectors. Job roles such as renewable energy engineers and autonomous vehicle specialists seem to be growing in demand as more and more companies invest in carbon reduction and climate adaptation strategies. Also, hiring strategies in India are being influenced by rising costs, geopolitical issues, and supply chain disruptions. This has led to increasing demand in risk management, cybersecurity, and logistics. Skills of the future Story continues below this ad When it comes to skills, analytical thinking remains the most sought after skill, as according to the report over 70 per cent of companies look at it as an essential skill. Along with technological skill, human-centered and creative thinking skills are also among the increasingly valued skills. In order to succeed in this evolving landscape, the workforce in India should focus on acquiring these critical skills. The table below lists the top skills based on relevance. Category Skills Technology AI and big data, cybersecurity, programming, automation, technological literacy Human-centered Analytical thinking, resilience, flexibility, agility, leadership, social influence Sustainability Environmental stewardship, sustainability practices Digital marketing Digital marketing strategies, online learning management\n\nIndian companies are bullish about automation and augmentation. Since automation is rapidly evolving, certain monotonous tasks are likely to be replaced. According to the report, by 2030 the share of tasks performed by humans alone is likely to decline from 47 per cent to 33 per cent. At the same time, augmentation\u2014where humans and machines collaborate\u2014is emerging as a promising trend that will enhance productivity without substituting human roles completely. The report predicts that over 95 per cent of task reduction in the telecommunications sector will be due to automation. On the other hand, increased augmentation will likely drive efficiency while retaining human-centric roles in medical and healthcare services.",

The article highlights research, forthcoming in Management Science, analyzing over a million job posts and found significant declines in demand for automation-prone jobs like writing (30%) and software development (20%) since the introduction of Gen AI tools. Similarly, graphic design and 3D modeling jobs declined by 17% within a year of tools like DALL-E entering the market. This drop in demand has intensified competition among freelancers, with more bids per job and an increased focus on AI-related skills. The study further reveals that Gen AI\u2019s impact goes beyond task replacement, increasing job complexity and requiring broader skill sets. For example, after ChatGPT\u2019s launch, automation-prone job postings required 2.18% more skills than manual-intensive ones, indicating that while Gen AI may reduce demand for some roles, it simultaneously elevates the skill level required for others, underscoring the critical need for upskilling and reskilling in the workforce.

        "text": "CW / Hannah Grace Mayfield A student looks at ChatGPT on their computer.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence, or AI, has influenced conversations about the future of the traditional workplace. AI promises efficiency and innovation; however, it is not just revolutionizing industries \u2014 it\u2019s taking over people\u2019s jobs. The question isn\u2019t when will AI impact the job field, but how deeply. The truth is that AI is doing more harm than good.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that AI has already impacted workplaces. From customer service chatbots to food delivery machines, AI is reducing the need for human workers in every field. Laney Vullo, a freshman psychology major at The University of Alabama, said, \u201cAt Publix, we have needed fewer employees to work the customer service desk because we have an online customer service chat where you talk to an AI-generated robot instead of a real person.\u201d\n\nTo speak to Vullo\u2019s concerns, robots have replaced assembly line workers in manufacturing plants even though they are unreliable and tend to have problems similar to talking to a robot about an issue you had with a product. Even creative fields like journalism and advertising are slowly getting targeted. AI-generated articles and artwork are on the rise, thus threatening roles that were once seen as unique and strictly human.\n\nSome might say that this shift is inevitable and that it might even be beneficial to us as a whole. AI can be a stress reliever and allow people to focus on more rewarding tasks. A future with AI could lead to humans being more dedicated to themselves and even willing to take on more meaningful or intellectual roles. This approach views AI as a collaborator rather than a competitor. But is that really the case?\n\nThe reality for many workers is that by 2030 AI will have taken over 30% of jobs. Truck drivers, basic financial reporters and warehouse workers are among those most at risk of losing their jobs due to AI. Jobs that require specialized skills are at risk of being taken over by AI due to the time and resources required to train these employees.\n\n\u201cI believe that AI can take out many researchers\u2019 jobs because they can run on an application and do not need human interaction,\u201d said Sadie Boyer, a sophomore nursing major. This allows room for a growing divide between the jobs that can thrive with the new AI domination and those that simply cannot due to the need for human interaction. There is no middle ground.\n\nWhile embracing AI\u2019s potential is valuable, there also needs to be a transition period for workers. Governments, companies and communities must collaborate and create training programs that can help prepare workers for the job market. If innovation is the main focus of AI, then there has to be a way to enforce a support system for those affected by AI.\n\nIf we continue to incorporate AI into everyday life, then its promise of a better and more efficient future might turn into a bleak reality for those who work in fields that are being taken over by technology. The rapid integration of AI in the workplace will end up creating a world where efficiency comes at the cost of meaningful employment and human connection, thus leaving society to suffer the consequences of choosing machines over people.",

While the research team found that AI related occupations typically require a higher level of education and a larger number of skills, reflecting the complex nature of these roles, the demand for AI-specific skills has surged by 21% over this period, while the proportion of AI roles requiring formal higher education qualifications has declined. In 2018, 36% of AI job postings specified a degree requirement, but by 2023, this had dropped to 31%.\n\nEducation and training providers should embrace flexible programmes informed by industry requirements and provide micro-certificates and credentials for skills acquired outside of formal education. A skills-based hiring approach can increase the number of potential candidates, the variety of workers' social backgrounds and add diverse insights to the workforce. Dr Fabian Stephany, Departmental Research Lecturer, Oxford Internet Institute The research also highlights the financial advantage of AI skills in today's job market. Science, engineering, and technology roles requiring AI expertise offer salaries that are, on average, three times higher than those stipulating only a degree qualification. AI skills themselves attract a 23% wage premium, compared to 13% for a master's degree and 33% for a PhD.\n\nDr Fabian Stephany , Departmental Research Lecturer in AI and Work at OII and co-author of the study, said:\n\n'Our research suggests that the UK's labour market is undergoing a fundamental shift. The traditional path of university education leading to higher pay is no longer the default for AI professionals, who are now being rewarded for practical skills and industry-specific know-how.\n\n'Education and training providers should embrace flexible programmes informed by industry requirements and provide micro-certificates and credentials for skills acquired outside of formal education.

Meanwhile, 77% of companies said they intended to scale their use of AI in the recruiting process over the next year.\n\n63% of recruiters and hiring decision makers said they already used AI as part of the recruiting process, up from 58% last year, a separate survey by Employ found.\n\nJeff Hyman, a veteran recruiter and the CEO of Recruit Rockstars, says AI software is growing more popular among hiring managers to weed through stacks of seemingly ideal candidates.\n\n\"Ironically, big companies are using AI to go through that stack, that AI has brought first place, and it's becoming this ridiculous tit-for-tat battle,\" Hyman told BI in an interview. \"I would say human judgment \u2026 is what rules the day, but certainly, we use a lot of software to reduce a stack from 500 to 50, because you got to start somewhere,\" he later added.\n\nTim Sackett, the president of the tech staffing firm HRU Technical Resources, says some firms are beta-testing AI software that can allow companies to detect fraud on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2014 a development he thinks will make the job market significantly more competitive. That technology could become mainstream as soon as mid-2025, he speculated, given how fast AI tech is accelerating.\n\n\"It's just going to get worse,\" Sackett said of companies being more selective of new hires. \"I mean, if more candidates become really used to utilizing AI to help them match a job better, to network better, it's just going to happen.\"\n\nThe interview-to-offer ratio at enterprise companies declined to 64% in July of this year, according to Employ's survey, which indicates companies are interviewing fewer candidates before making a hiring decision.\n\n\"Recruiters are scrutinizing candidates more closely,\" Hyman adds. \"My candidate interviews have become longer and more in-depth, designed to truly test a candidate's abilities beyond a polished r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nInundated by AI\n\nEmployers aren't big fans of AI as a tool for candidates to get a leg up. That's partly because it's led to hiring systems being flooded with applications sent using AI, Sackett and Hyman said, which has made hiring decisions way harder.\n\nWorkday found that job applications grew at four times the pace of job openings in the first half of this year, with recruiters processing 173 million applications, while there were just 19 million job requisitions.\n\nHaving too many candidates for a position was the third most common problem recruiters faced in 2024, Employ added.\n\nHyman estimates the number of applications he reviews has doubled over the last year. Some of the more lucrative job postings are seeing close to 1,000 applications, he said, whereas they would have attracted 100-200 applications before the pandemic.\n\n\"I mean, a stack so big, that you can't even go through it, it's just not even possible to spend that kind of time,\" he said.\n\nCandidates sending in applications spruced up with AI has also made it harder to determine who can actually do the job.\n\nSackett says he's seen an increase in \"false positive\" hiring, where a worker is hired and is quickly let go of their position when it becomes clear they're unable to do the job.\n\n\"I think what hiring managers are concerned about: Is this CV real when I'm talking to this person? Am I talking to the real person or are they using AI in the background?\" Sackett said. He recalled one client he worked with who realized multiple candidates responded to interview questions in the same way, likely because they were using AI to write their responses. \"So I think people just want to know that I'm getting what I think I'm getting.\"",

        "text": "October 29, 2024\n\nBEIJING \u2013 As artificial intelligence continues to make headlines, Chinese internet companies are busy scouting for talent that can take them to the forefront of this transformational technology. The domestic job market is in the process of adapting to this new environment, which in turn is raising the eligibility threshold for job seekers, experts said.\n\nA joint report released recently by Peking University\u2019s National School of Development and recruitment portal Zhaopin shows that AI-related job openings surged in the first half of the year.\n\nPositions related to natural language processing increased 111 percent year-on-year in the first six months on Zhaopin, while those related to deep learning increased 61 percent. The average monthly salary for these jobs was around 24,000 yuan ($3,370).\n\nHu Jiayin, an associate professor at the National School of Development, noted that it is not easy to get AI-related jobs, because they have higher entry threshold.\n\n\u201cSeveral positions related to natural language processing and deep learning have higher requirements in terms of education and work experience. The eligibility criteria have been rising, so it\u2019s necessary to get higher education degrees and richer work experience if job seekers wish for employment in the AI sector,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2022, United States-based OpenAI\u2019s chatbot ChatGPT and other large language models \u2014 AI systems that are capable of comprehending and generating human language by processing vast amounts of text data \u2014 caught the domestic job market off guard.\n\nThe massive influence of AI has already reduced some clerical and customer service-based positions, Zhaopin said, and the joint report concluded that job seekers must continuously improve their skill set in order to remain competitive in the rapidly changing employment market.\n\nAnother report, released by the World Bank earlier this month, also mentioned the impact of AI on jobs, particularly in East Asia and the Pacific region.\n\n\u201cDisplacement effects are beginning to be felt in occupations involving primarily routine cognitive tasks that involve standard optimization and low social interaction, and gradually to occupations involving nonroutine cognitive tasks,\u201d the World Bank report said.\n\n\u201cMalaysia and China stand out as countries with a relatively high share of people employed in nonroutine cognitive tasks who may be equipped to benefit from complementarities with AI,\u201d it added.\n\nXu Yifan, 27, a postgraduate student at Shanghai University of Engineering Science, said he is optimistic about a career in the AI sector because he is focusing on the research of federated learning, a state-of-the-art AI tool mainly used in data security and distributed data processing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that fast-developing AI technologies have greatly shocked traditional industries and the job market. I think the knowledge and skills I\u2019ve acquired, especially in federated learning, will work to my advantage. AI is not just a technology-driven innovation tool, it is also a force reshaping society and the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nXu said that to cope with the ever-changing revolution brought by AI, it is necessary for him to keep learning. \u201cNew algorithms, tools and applications come up all the time, which require us to be learners for life. A certain single skill will not work forever, so we need to train ourselves to be all-arounders, combining AI knowledge with other skills to foster competitiveness in such a complicated job market,\u201d he added.\n\nLi Qiang, vice-president of Zhaopin, said that job seekers need to be more flexible and have the ability to keep learning new things, in order to adjust to a life and career based on AI.\n\n\u201cIt is important for people to be sensitive to AI-related knowledge and development and to embrace the integration of such knowledge with their current professions, such as healthcare or finance,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cLearning some soft skills that AI lacks, such as teamwork and communication, and becoming involved in or leading some AI projects to gain more practical experience, if possible, would also be beneficial,\u201d he added.\n\nHu, from Peking University, emphasized that no job seeker or employee could be a bystander in the AI storm. For average employees, it\u2019s important to learn to use some AI tools while enhancing soft skills, including their ability to innovate, organize and communicate, she said.",

        "text": "The US labor market is being shaped by three intersecting trends: two of them long-term and the third cyclical. Generative artificial intelligence is poised to automate nearly a quarter of jobs across all industries. The effects of AI will be felt on a workforce that is already \u201cfractionalized,\u201d in which part-time roles supplement or replace full-time ones.\n\nThose two megatrends feed into a slowing job market. Goldman Sachs Research expects US unemployment to rise over the next 12 months. In combination, these three forces will profoundly change how US companies recruit and retain talent in the near future.\n\nHow AI will transform staffing and recruiting\n\nAround 4% of all US firms have adopted generative AI, but Goldman Sachs Research expects that figure to rise to 7% over the next six months. The rapid clip will be led by some sectors more than others. In information services, for instance, the adoption rate is forecast to rise from 16% to 23% in that half-year period.\n\nThe effects of this shift will be seen clearly in online job marketplaces. Some types of work, such as logo design, copywriting, translation, or voice-over artistry, could be displaced by free or cheap AI tools in those categories. \u201cThat said, it is just as likely that new types of jobs or categories will be created as a result of AI,\u201d writes George Tong, a senior research analyst at Goldman Sachs Research, in his team\u2019s report.\n\nGenerative AI can also improve the efficiency of recruiters in tasks such as enhancing job descriptions, formatting resumes, ranking candidates, and conducting initial interviews. \u201cScreening applicant information such as resumes remains inefficient, with approximately 52% of talent acquisition leaders stating that the most challenging element of recruiting is candidate identification from large pools,\u201d Tong writes.",

        "text": "One in every four American workers that have lost their jobs this year worked in professional and business services, a sign that the white-collar labor market may be straining under the weight of high interest rates and that technological advances may already be making some workers obsolete.\n\nIn September, employers shed 497,000 professional and business services jobs \u2014 which includes accountants, consultants and legal workers \u2014 the highest for the group in nearly two years and more than any other sector during the month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Oct. 29. Through the first nine months of 2024, professional and business service sector jobs accounted for more than 3.7 million of the nearly 14.9 million layoffs and discharges in the US.\n\nWhile the exact causes of these job cuts remain unclear, it could reflect a cyclical weakness sparked by higher interest rates and overall restrictive monetary policy hindering investment and employment. It may also reflect more structural changes, with the rising number of layoffs and stalling growth in the sector potentially connected to new technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, replacing white-collar workers and improving productivity with a smaller number of employees, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.\n\n\"If those trends stick in the coming months, even as interest rates fall and activity in various markets revives, that could be evidence in support of the theory that the economy is fundamentally changing due to new technologies,\" Pollak said.\n\nThe overall number of Americans employed in the professional and business services sector ballooned by nearly 3.8 million from April 2020 to over 22.9 million in April 2024, but growth has largely stagnated since, peaking just below 23 million in May 2024, where it has essentially stalled.\n\n\"While it is still well above the pre-COVID level, it is now clearly below the pre-COVID trend,\" Pollak said.\n\nAs growth has stalled, hiring in the sector has flattened, and layoffs and discharges have begun to climb. The 497,000 layoffs and discharges in September were the most for the sector since January 2023.\n\nThe professional and business services sector includes temporary help services and staffing firms that have seen a pullback in recent months and often see dynamic labor turnover, said Cory Stahle, an economist with Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\nOverall, the jobs data shows a clear trend of cooling and rebalancing as job openings have fallen steeply from their peak in late 2021, Stahle said.\n\n\"That large peak gave the Federal Reserve a cushion to work with, but that is nearly spent,\" Stahle said. \"The labor market is still relatively solid, but we are at a point where further cooling could become more worrisome and start impacting unemployment.\"\n\nThere were 7.4 million job openings in the US in September, the lowest number of openings since January 2021, the new data shows.\n\n\"There is a question mark over whether they are being actively filled or whether the employer is just keeping the head count open,\" said James Knightley, chief international economist with ING. \"It is less painful to simply pull a vacancy rather than fire someone if you need to cut future budgets.\"\n\nAt the same time, the quits rate, a measure of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs, dropped to 1.9%, its lowest level since June 2020 and a sign that Americans are increasingly holding on to their jobs as options appear to be more limited.",

DOI: 10.1016/j.jebo.2024.106845\n\nDemand for professional skills has changed significantly since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, according to a new study. But the picture is complex. While there were fewer jobs in areas such as copywriting and translation, the demand for other skills increased.\n\nWill artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionize the labor market and make millions of jobs redundant? Or is there a tendency to exaggerate the impact of ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI?\n\nA new international study published in the Journal for Economic Behavior and Organization concludes that the truth is probably somewhere in between. Artificial intelligence is rapidly replacing jobs in some areas but creates new jobs in others.\n\nThe study is based on statistical analyses of more than 3 million freelance jobs with different skill profiles posted on one of the leading international freelance platforms before and after the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\n\"We can see that the demand for skills such as translation or copywriting and simple programming decreased significantly after the introduction of ChatGPT. But the study also shows that the demand for other skills has increased,\" says Ole Teutloff, who is affiliated with the Copenhagen Centre for Social Data Science (SODAS) at UCPH.\n\n\"The main takeaway is therefore that we are seeing significant changes in the composition of the labor market. But we are so far not talking about new AI technologies wiping out jobs across the board, making human labor redundant.\"\n\nJob posts down by almost a quarter\n\nOverall, the analysis shows that the number of freelance jobs offered in areas where ChatGPT can largely take over has decreased by around 24% compared to jobs where AI is used as a complementary tool or has no impact at all.\n\nThe jobs most negatively affected were writing about real estate and \"about us\" pages on websites. Here the number of posted jobs fell by more than 50%. Conversely, the number of freelance jobs increased in areas such as machine learning, chatbot development and more creative forms of text and video production.\n\nThe decline was particularly strong for short-term jobs of 1\u20133 weeks and for jobs aimed at freelancers with limited experience. According to the researchers behind the study, this makes sense, as more complex tasks continue to require human involvement.\n\nJohanna Einsiedler, co-author of the paper and Ph.D. student at SODAS, cautions against placing too much emphasis on specific numbers in the study, as the field of AI is developing rapidly. However, the overall trend is clear:\n\n\"We are potentially facing big changes. When we see the number of jobs available in the most AI-sensitive sectors falling by a quarter in just two years, it's obviously significant. And we probably haven't seen the full impact yet, with the freelance sector being affected faster than the rest of the labor market,\" she says.\n\nNew demands for flexibility\n\nAccording to the researchers behind the study, this poses new challenges for both employees and employers. Integrating AI into work processes will create winners and losers, depending on how AI technologies are implemented and what skills individuals have. Some jobs will disappear, and others will emerge.\n\nThis has happened before when new technologies have taken off. But in this case, policymakers should be paying special attention to how fast things are moving.\n\n\"It is a particular challenge when we talk about education and training, which takes time to change. Fortunately, Denmark has an education system that focuses on general skills. In my opinion, this will become even more important in a rapidly changing world. Some of the most important skills will be the curiosity to learn and the ability to adapt,\" Teutloff says.\n\nExamples of affected skill clusters\n\nNegatively affected (less jobs):\n\nWriting \"About Us\" pages\n\nReal estate content writing\n\nWeb design with Java script\n\nProofreading\n\nTranslation (W. European languages)\n\nBusiness analysis\n\nData science and statistics\n\nPositively affected (more jobs):\n\nChatbots\n\nCreative writing, explainer videos\n\nMachine learning\n\nTravel planning",

The balance of power may shift,\u201d the banking giant said in the intro to the report. \u201cAI may be adopted faster by digitally native, cloud-based firms, such as FinTechs and BigTechs, with agile incumbent banks following fast. Many incumbents, weighed down by tech and culture debt, could lag in AI adoption, losing market share.\u201d\n\nThe report also noted that a move to a \u201cbot-powered world\u201d also raises issues dealing with compliance, security, regulation and ethics.\n\n\u201cSince AI models are known to hallucinate and create information that does not exist, organizations run the risk of AI chatbots going fully autonomous and negatively affecting the business financially or its reputation,\u201d Citi said.\n\nOther industries with a high potential for automation, the report said, include insurance (46%), capital markets (40%) and energy (43%).\n\nCiti\u2019s report follows one earlier this year from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which contended that the impact of AI will be especially pronounced on advanced economies.\n\nWhile about 40% of global employment is exposed to AI, around 60% of jobs in advanced economies could be impacted by the technology, as it tends to affect high-skilled jobs.\n\n\u201cWhile half of these jobs may benefit from AI integration, the other half may see key tasks currently performed by humans being executed by AI applications, potentially resulting in lower labor demand, reduced wages and decreased hiring,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cIn some cases, certain jobs may even disappear,\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS recently examined the way technology such as AI and automation are increasingly combining to help CFOs amid a shortage of accountants.\n\n\u201cAI and ML are transforming everything treasury, it\u2019s the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution 4.0,\u201d Jarrett Bruhn, managing director and head of data and AI in global transaction services at Bank of America, told PYMNTS. \u201cWhen you think of what a treasurer does, trying to find operational and cost efficiencies, these tools and technologies fundamentally change how they can do their daily job.\u201d",

PwC research also finds that growth in jobs demanding AI skills has outpaced all jobs since 2016, with postings for jobs requiring AI skills growing 3.5x faster than for all jobs.\n\nThe findings also highlight economic opportunity for labour forces: jobs that require AI skills carry up to a 25% average wage premium in some markets.\n\nSkills sought by employers are changing much faster in occupations more exposed to AI, with old skills disappearing - and new skills appearing - in job ads at a 25% higher rate than in occupations less exposed to AI. To stay relevant in these occupations, workers will need to demonstrate or acquire new skills.\n\nAs questions abound around the technology\u2019s impact on everything from job security to long-term business viability, the findings highlight positive news, even for workers in sectors most exposed to AI. The findings also reflect a good news story for workers and the global economy in which AI-enabled workers are more productive and more valuable, opening the door to rising prosperity for workers and nations.

The country is now home to 10 percent of the world\u2019s AI researchers, the second most in the world.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a point of national pride\u2014AI is already reshaping the way people work and live. But while much of the attention is on AI\u2019s impact in labs and offices, the tech is also making waves in Canada\u2019s job market.\n\nFive roles across Canada to apply for today\n\nAI is quietly embedding itself into the hiring process and changing how candidates approach their career search. In a job market that can feel impossibly stacked, AI is becoming an unlikely ally to job seekers in Canada.\n\nA new skill to hone\n\nThe AI sector in Canada is growing at an astonishing pace, with the market projected to increase by 33.9 percent annually between 2023 and 2028. By then, it\u2019s expected to reach $28.2 billion\u2014part of a global boom that could surpass $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nFor anyone job hunting in 2025, this explosion is a signal to take AI skills seriously, whether through formal training or self-learning.\n\nIf you\u2019re already using generative AI to write cover letters, tweak your resum\u00e9 in response to particular job ads, and prepare for interviews, you\u2019ve seen how it can streamline the basics.\n\nBut AI goes further\u2014not only can AI help you optimize your applications, it can shortcut your search with conversational search technology, and be used as a smarter outreach and networking tool.\n\nLet your next job find you\n\nCanadian tech workers are no strangers to the challenges of navigating the job market: endless scrolling, vague job descriptions, and little clarity until late in the process.\n\nBut conversational AI is starting to change that by making it easier to find jobs that match your skills and goals without all the guesswork.\n\nTake Robin from Amply, as an example. Robin is a conversational AI job search agent designed to help you locate your next tech position, fast.\n\nInstead of wasting time sifting through irrelevant postings, you can focus on opportunities that fit. It\u2019s a tool built for simplicity, and as more companies add it to their career pages, it\u2019s becoming a key resource for job seekers.\n\nYou can also casually tell Robin about your skills, career aspirations, and preferred work environment. Through agentic AI, this simplifies your job search by instantly identifying relevant roles, helping you bypass endless scrolling.\n\nRobin also makes awkward questions less awkward. You can ask about salary ranges, benefits, or work environments early on\u2014details you\u2019d hesitate to bring up with a hiring manager. By putting this information upfront, Robin removes unnecessary friction from the job search, making it more straightforward and efficient.\n\nAutomate the background work\n\nReaching out to potential employers has always been an art, but AI is turning it into a science. With the right tools, job seekers can analyze postings, identify key priorities, and craft messages that hit the mark.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re eyeing roles in Alberta\u2019s growing clean tech industry, AI tools can surface company projects and trends worth mentioning to give your outreach a sharper edge.\n\nBy taking the guesswork out of research and strategy, AI frees you to focus on what really matters: making a genuine impression and showcasing your unique value.\n\nReady to flex your human skills in job searching?

        "text": "PETALING JAYA: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by companies, which poses a significant risk of displacing a large portion of the workforce, has prompted calls for emphasis on helping affected workers maintain employment.\n\nAccording to the Statistics Department, there were 558,500 unemployed individuals in Malaysia as of August.\n\nThe situation may become severe as the implementation of AI leads to a reshaping of the job market.\n\nConcerns have particularly grown following the recent decision by TikTok to lay off 481 employees in Malaysia as part of a global workforce reduction as the social media platform shifts its focus to increased use of AI in content moderation.\n\nThe move has primarily affected employees involved in content moderation, who were informed of their layoffs via email earlier this month.\n\nUniversiti Sains Islam Malaysia human resources and development lecturer Assoc Prof Dr Abdul Rahim Zumrah said the rise of AI will inevitably impact job roles in the tech industry.\n\nHe said the current situation could contribute to a higher unemployment rate as compensation is one of the biggest liabilities for companies.\n\n\u201cTo reduce this liability, many organisations will opt for more cost-effective alternatives, such as AI, to replace employees,\u201d he told theSun.\n\n\u201cWhile technology and innovation are unavoidable, profit-driven companies focus on cutting costs, with one key strategy being to minimise their workforce.\u201d\n\nAbdul Rahim said some big companies were willing to invest in technology if it could deliver the same output or service as human workers.\n\nHe stressed that laid-off individuals may face significant challenges when seeking new employment, particularly due to the intense competition in today\u2019s job market.\n\n\u201cThe main obstacle is often related to salary expectations, which can be a major barrier when applying for positions at other organisations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile their work experience may not be an issue, the real challenge lies in whether they are willing to accept a lower salary or a reduced position in order to secure a new job.\u201d\n\nInternational Islamic University Malaysia Department of Mechatronics Engineering associate professor Dr Yasir Mohd Mustafah said the layoffs by TikTok highlight the growing impact of AI on jobs and in this case content moderation work where AI is increasingly able to recognise inappropriate content.\n\n\u201cThis shift by TikTok, while increasing their efficiency, might remove an important aspect of human understanding of local cultural context to the task, which could later bring problems to the company.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, Malaysians need to acknowledge this trend brought by AI, especially in digital service industries, and must work hard to improve their knowledge on AI-related fields and find ways to adapt to new roles.\u201d\n\nYasir said the future of jobs will likely hold a hybrid model of human and AI collaboration.\n\n\u201cWhile AI handles routine tasks such as quick filtering of digital content, humans will focus on complex analyses and issues requiring critical thinking, empathy and cultural understanding,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Animation Educators Association president Assoc Prof Ahamad Tarmizi Azizan said while AI has become an efficient tool in moderating content, it is still far from perfect.\n\nHe said AI often struggles with nuanced contexts, cultural sensitivities or sarcasm, which may cause misinterpretation and inappropriate flagging or censoring.\n\n\u201cTherefore, human oversight remains essential to ensure that AI-driven content moderation systems function effectively and ethically.\n\n\u201cThis oversight is crucial for addressing complex cases, reducing biases in AI decisions and ensuring that the moderation process aligns with ethical standards and user expectations,\u201d he said.\n\nAhamad Tarmizi added that the shift toward AI in content moderation will inevitably transform roles within the tech industry, with repetitive, high-volume tasks largely delegated to AI systems.\n\nHe stressed that deploying AI in content moderation raises significant ethical concerns, including algorithms that may inherit or even amplify biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory or inconsistent moderation.",

The Future of Jobs Report 2023 found that by 2027, approximately 25% of jobs will transform, with 69 million new positions created and 83 million existing roles displaced.\n\nIn this context, job transitions are required to enable workers to move out of declining roles and into stable and growing ones.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Framework for Preparing Workers for Dynamic Job Transitions proposes four key levers to prepare workers for transitions. It highlights the roles that public and private sectors can play in enabling these transitions. The four pillars of the framework read as follows:\n\nReskilling and upskilling for new opportunities.\n\nImproving employee-employer matching.\n\nWorker safety nets.\n\nMultistakeholder collaboration to break through industry barriers.\n\nThe four pillars of the framework for preparing workers for dynamic job transitions. Image: World Economic Forum\n\n4 programmes promoting successful job transitions\n\nConcerted efforts from all stakeholders and a cultural shift towards embracing lifelong learning and career fluidity are essential for building a resilient and adaptable workforce capable of navigating the future of work. But what does this look like in practice? How are real people and organizations turning these concepts into career-changing opportunities?\n\nThe following innovative case studies exemplify how governments and employers can use the enablers outlined in the framework to facilitate successful job transitions.\n\nHave you read? Unlocking Opportunity: A Global Framework for Enabling Transitions to the Jobs of Tomorrow\n\nBoot Camp Training programme, Randstad Japan\n\nJapan is experiencing a growing imbalance between the available labour force and the demand for workers across various industries due to its declining and ageing population. Additionally, a notable shortage of skilled workers, particularly in technology fields, creates a scarcity of engineers and technology professionals.\n\nRandstad Japan implemented a Boot Camp Training programme to facilitate career transitions into digital and IT roles, helping bridge this skills gap and providing a pathway for workers to enter the growing technology field. The programme offers intensive training courses lasting three to four weeks, combining online and face-to-face instruction.\n\nParticipants gain hands-on experience with actual equipment, focusing on entry-level digital and IT infrastructure skills. Upon completing the training, Randstad works proactively with existing clients and prospects, particularly system integrators, to secure entry-level job opportunities for programme graduates.\n\nSince its inception in 2014, 3,000 participants have completed the training and transitioned from non-digital roles, such as shop clerks, waitstaff and beauty advisers, to digital and IT positions. This programme exemplifies the importance of re-skilling, multi-stakeholder collaboration and improving job matching efficiency in supporting job transitions.\n\nBerufsinfomat Project, Austrian Ministry for Labour and Economy\n\nRecent technological advancements and concerns about the future of work have made it challenging to find suitable jobs across all age groups in Austria. The AMS (Public Employment Service Austria) websites have extensive job-related content but it is hard for users to search it quickly and effectively. Additionally, Austria is seeing an influx of non-German speakers who lack information on finding suitable jobs.\n\nSince January, the AMS has used the Berufsinfomat, a customized AI system based on ChatGPT, to provide real-time occupation information. This AI tool accesses AMS knowledge databases on professions, training and education, offering quick and comprehensive answers.\n\nUsers can ask questions in any common language and get relevant answers in the same language or translated to German. This tool can help understand what jobs are currently available, increase job matching efficiency and lead to job transitions.\n\nThe Berufsinfomat received 160,000 prompts in January 2024 and around 20,000 monthly inquiries. The tool\u2019s feedback option has been extensively used to improve its content. Initial challenges with gender-related jobs, bias, and moral dilemmas were addressed, and the reviews are now positive.\n\nEmpleaT Programme of Anglo American, TechnoServe Chile\n\nRural and semi-rural communes of the Metropolitan and Valpara\u00edso Regions in Chile face high unemployment rates among vulnerable young people and women (up to 26% unemployment for young women, significantly above the national average).\n\nTo help young people and women transition into the labour market, Anglo American, IDB Lab, and Technoserve created the EmpleaT Programme, developing a comprehensive model that aligns women\u2019s and young people\u2019s skills with labour market demands.\n\nIt includes certified training in high-demand trades and personalized counselling to enhance socio-emotional skills, coupled with workshops on empowerment skills such as self-leadership and self-confidence. The programme thrives to promote female inclusion in traditionally male-dominated fields, such as industrial maintenance and welding.\n\nEmpleaT drove a significant transformation within the private sector by partnering with recruiters to dismantle misconceptions that excluded women from jobs, exemplifying the importance and effectiveness of multi-stakeholder collaboration for job transitions.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, the programme achieved a 40% employment rate of participants within six months post-intervention. Following the integration of new empowerment tools, this figure rose to 65% employability within the same timeframe from 2020 onwards.\n\nOf those employed, 61% are women and 72% are young people aged between 18 and 35. Over the years, more than 3,800 individuals have been supported in transitioning to new and better jobs.\n\nCareer Tech Platform, Localized Egypt\n\nIt is increasingly difficult for early-stage talent in emerging markets to find employment due to the growing working-age population, high levels of unemployment and technology\u2019s impact on particularly lower-skilled entry-level positions.\n\nLocalized provides a solution to this problem through a talent tech platform bridging global employers with top early-stage talent in emerging markets to help young talent transition into the labour market.\n\nIt provides access to various job postings, including internships, entry-level roles and remote positions across different industries and career guidance. It also offers resources and support for career exploration, including webinars, workshops, and expert sessions to help users navigate their career paths.\n\nLocalized also fosters connections between students and industry professionals, enabling users to join communities focused on specific career interests and industry trends.\n\nThe platform serves over 100,000 university students and recent graduates, connecting thousands with recruiters and human resources leaders at top global companies. It thereby improves job-matching efficiency and exemplifies multi-stakeholder collaboration.\n\nJob transitions are an inevitable response to the evolving demands of the global labour market, but governments and employers are key to supporting workers\u2019 transitions for better outcomes. The Forum\u2019s recently published paper explores job transitions through data identifying viable and desirable job transitions across a broad geographical scope and a larger collection of job transition case studies.",

        "text": "ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Seasoned recruiters are no strangers to job seekers exaggerating their credentials to land a job, but the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is taking deception to new levels. Capterra\u2019s 2024 Job Seeker AI Survey, which polled nearly 3,000 job seekers globally, finds over half (58%) are using AI tools in their current job search. Among these, many have exaggerated or lied about their skills on resumes.\n\nAI is creating new challenges for recruiters as job seekers use it to mask skill deficiencies\n\nJob seekers using AI to mask skills deficiencies represent a formidable challenge in the quest for talent. However, companies aren\u2019t without their defenses. Leveraging advanced recruiting software and reviewing hiring processes can minimize AI cheating, flag deceptive AI content, and help eliminate fraudulent candidates.\n\nJob seekers are more likely to receive a job offer when using AI during the application process\n\nAI\u2019s role in job searching is complex, and not all uses are harmful to the candidate evaluation process. The most common AI applications include writing or refining resumes, finding relevant job openings, and crafting cover letters. Job seekers using AI have completed 41% more job applications on average during their current search than those who don\u2019t use it. They are also 53% more likely to receive a job offer.\n\nBut some AI uses cross the line into deception. For instance, 29% of job seekers have used AI to complete a test assignment or skills assessment, potentially hiding a lack of relevant skills. Additionally, 28% have used AI to generate answers to interview questions, while 26% have used AI to mass apply to jobs, overwhelming recruiting pipelines.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this issue so complex is that not all AI uses are necessarily bad,\u201d says Brian Westfall, principal HR analyst at Capterra. \u201cIf a job seeker is using AI to refine their resume or cover letter, most employers won\u2019t bat an eye. It\u2019s when they\u2019re using AI to mask a skills deficiency that recruiters need to be on guard.\u201d\n\nWith 82% of respondents saying it's likely that other people applying for similar jobs are using AI to embellish or exaggerate their job applications, job seekers may feel the need to adopt AI simply to keep up with other candidates and thus perpetuate this cycle.\n\nCompanies seeking to reduce AI deception and identify AI cheaters need clear guidelines\n\nEmployers can reduce AI deception and identify AI cheaters by clearly communicating which uses are acceptable from the start, leveraging tools to detect fraudulent content, and shifting to video or in-person interviews to avoid AI-generated responses. Placing a greater emphasis on candidate references and ensuring that the hiring manager has sufficient time for thorough screening, is also crucial.\n\nAs more job seekers realize the benefits of AI to their job search, employers will need to move quickly to draw their line in the sand on what constitutes AI fair play. Those that then combine the right AI detection tools with critical recruiting processes and culture changes will have a clear advantage in identifying and hiring truly talented candidates.\n\nFor additional insights, expert analyses, and actionable recommendations that can help HR leaders navigate the rise in AI job applications, visit Capterra.com.\n\nAbout Capterra\n\nCapterra is the #1 destination for organizations to find the right software and services.

You run the risk of being left behind,\u201d Duke finance professor John Graham, academic director of the survey, told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nThe CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke and the Atlanta and Richmond Fed banks, found that nearly one in three (32%) firms \u2014 large or small \u2014 plan to use AI in the next year to complete tasks once done by humans.\n\nWhy bosses are deploying AI\n\nSome of this is already happening \u2014 especially among larger firms that have the financial firepower to experiment with AI.\n\nNearly 60% of all companies (and 84% of large companies) surveyed said that over the past year they have already leaned on software, equipment or technology including AI to automate tasks employees previously did. The survey was conducted between May 13 and June 3.\n\nBosses are turning to AI for a variety of reasons, including to trim what they are spending on human workers.\n\nThe CFO Survey found that companies say they are using automation to increase product quality (58% of firms); increase output (49%), reduce labor costs (47%) and substitute for workers (33%).\n\nStill, the good news for workers is that some experts don\u2019t believe AI will cause mass job loss, at least not right away.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a lot of job loss in the year,\u201d said Graham. \u201cIn the short run, this will be more about plugging some holes and possibly not hiring someone they would have otherwise \u2014 but not laying someone off. In part that\u2019s because this is all-brand new.\u201d\n\nSee more\n\nAI co-pilots on the way?\n\nYet workers will feel the impact of AI adoption, if they aren\u2019t already.\n\n\u201cThis could give humans more time to prioritize what is most important and rewarding,\u201d said Graham.\n\nReid Hoffman, the billionaire investor and co-founder of LinkedIn, told CNN that AI will likely disrupt some jobs but not in the immediate future.\n\n\u201cYears, not decades, but years, not months,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the timing of AI displacing humans. \u201cI believe in three to five years, we\u2019ll all have kind of an agent co-pilot that\u2019s helping us with anything from how we cook dinner\u2026to doing your job and writing and so forth.\u201d\n\nHoffman, who last year wrote a book called \u201cImpromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\u201d with the assistance from ChatGPT-4, stressed that for a number of years it will be a co-pilot, not a pilot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s job transformation. Human jobs will be replaced \u2014 but will be replaced by other humans using AI,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole ideas is to be the human who is using AI, to learn it, to do it, to make it happen.\u201d\n\nAI and inflation\n\nFor now, bosses and employees remain concerned about the cost of living and inflationary pressures.\n\nThe CFO Survey found that inflation is the No. 2 concern for the next year among US chief financial officers \u2013 behind only the related concern of interest rates and monetary policy.\n\nMost CFOs (57%) expect the price of their products to increase this year at a faster-than-normal pace.\n\nHowever, there was a divergence in the inflation outlook based on technological adoption. The survey found that companies that implemented automation over the past 12 months expect slower price hikes than those that hadn\u2019t.\n\nSee more\n\nGraham, the Duke professor, said that AI could eventually help moderate price increases but isn\u2019t optimistic it will be a major force to easing inflation right now.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it will be the cure in the next year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Significant risks\u2019\n\nThe CFO survey shows how fast companies are turning to AI \u2014 even as safeguards and regulatory frameworks are still being cobbled together.\n\nThe rapid adoption of AI in some industries like finance has concerned some.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a speech earlier this month that the use of AI by financial companies poses both \u201ctremendous opportunities and significant risks.\u201d\n\nA report issued last week by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, found that exiting regulation \u201cinsufficiently addresses\u201d how hedge funds are already using AI.\n\nThe report warned that there are \u201cno regulations or requirements\u201d mandating \u201cwhen and whether a human must be involved in decision making, including related to trading decisions.\u201d\n\nGraham, the Duke professor, said it would be wise for companies in all industries to have strong risk management systems and redundancies in place as they experiment with AI.\n\n\u201cThere has been rapid adoption of AI,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s being done with a grain of salt. There will be some situations where companies have embarrassing products or supply chain situations because they moved a little too fast.\u201d",

        "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to cause significant changes in the job market over the next decade. According to a report by McKinsey, AI will lead to around 12 million occupational transitions by 2030, a pace comparable to the job shifts seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kweilin Ellingrud, a senior partner at McKinsey and director of its Global Institute, shared these insights during the firm's recent media day.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead More\n\nCertain sectors are expected to experience growth due to AI advancements, particularly in healthcare and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. However, the majority of job impacts will be concentrated in four main categories: administrative assistance, customer service and sales, food service, and production and manufacturing.\n\nEllingrud noted that many roles in these categories involve repetitive tasks, data collection, and basic data processing. These functions are prime candidates for automation, which AI can handle efficiently. A McKinsey report, co-authored by Ellingrud, estimates that approximately 11.8 million workers in roles facing decreasing demand will need to transition to new lines of work by 2030.\n\nDespite these significant changes, the report - spotted by Business Insider - highlights that all workers should prepare for some level of adaptation. The widespread adoption of generative AI and traditional automation technologies will impact about 30 per cent of tasks in many current jobs. This means that nearly everyone will need to adjust their work practices to accommodate the new technologies.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEllingrud highlighted the need for workers to be proactive in adapting to these changes. \"It's crucial for individuals to stay informed about the evolving job landscape and develop skills that are less susceptible to automation,\" she said. This includes focusing on areas where human creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence are irreplaceable by machines.\n\nIn simpler terms, the report suggests that AI is likely to bring substantial changes to the job market by 2030, with millions of workers needing to transition to new roles. While certain sectors like healthcare and STEM are expected to grow, many roles involving repetitive tasks will be automated. Workers must adapt to these changes, and support from businesses, educators, and policymakers will be crucial in facilitating a successful transition.\n\nPublished By: Ankita Garg Published On: Jun 2, 2024\n\nTune In",

More than 33 million people are employed in the UK.\n\nAI, a technology that can be loosely defined as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, has shot up the political agenda after the emergence of the ChatGPT chatbot and other breakthroughs in the field.\n\nTBI added that it did not expect the scale of the displacement to be reflected in long-term job losses. It predicted total losses to be in the low hundreds of thousands at its peak at the end of the next decade as AI creates new demand for workers and pulls them back into the economy.\n\n\u201cOur best guess is that AI\u2019s peak, impact on unemployment is likely to be in the low hundreds of thousands and for the effect to unwind over time,\u201d said the report, titled the Impact of AI on the Labour Market. \u201cA common lesson is that AI is likely to increase the dynamism of the labour market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones.\u201d\n\nSuch a process will require an \u201cupgrade\u201d to the UK\u2019s labour market infrastructure, TBI said, which could include an early warning system flagging how a worker\u2019s job could be affected by AI.\n\nThe report estimated that deployment of AI could raise GDP \u2013 a measure of economic growth \u2013 by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035. Unemployment, meanwhile, could rise by 180,000 by 2030. Currently, there are about 1.4 million unemployed people in the UK.\n\nHowever, TBI, which has described AI as a \u201csubstantial policy challenge\u201d, said all of these scenarios are dependent on factors such as what tools emerge over the next decade, investment decisions made by private firms and government policies that accelerate or delay implementation.\n\nThe thinktank said AI would \u201ccertainly\u201d replace some jobs but could create more by boosting workers\u2019 productivty, which would increase economic growth and create more job openings. It could also follow the pattern of previous technological breakthroughs by creating products and sectors that require workers to perform new tasks and roles.\n\nTBI indicated that administrative and secretarial jobs will be the most exposed to the technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance.

        "text": "The debate on AI and job loss misses the deeper impact: by automating creativity, we risk devaluing the very essence of human expression.\n\nSomething is missing in the debate about generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and creative workers losing their jobs. The current conversation reduces creative activity to content production: marketable output. But creativity is so much more. It\u2019s our attempt to articulate what we feel inside, both intellectually and emotionally. Being creative means grappling with the mess we encounter in our lives and on this planet\u2014and somehow coming to terms with it, both collectively and individually. A debate that suggests only jobs are lost when generative AI takes over misses the essence of what creativity entails.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back for a moment. AI has its hype cycles, and so do the doom scenarios it spawns. A decade ago, when neural networks took off, they were seen as dreadful harbingers of impending mass unemployment. Now, in 2024, many European companies struggle not with mass lay-offs but with filling vacancies. Company bosses with tech Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) promise to \u201cdefinitely look into\u201d adopting AI in their firms. However, it rarely goes much further than that. For better or worse, economy-wide AI implementation lags behind expectations.\n\nWas the job market doom just a false alarm? Not quite. In many sectors, AI is not a major concern so far. Most taxi drivers need not lose sleep yet over self-driving Waymo cars. In some sectors, though, AI does encroach on jobs, and creative roles are on the front line. Generative AI is already quite capable, and it\u2019s improving daily.\n\nTop-notch opera composers or painters with work in the Guggenheim may have nothing to fear. However, people who pay the rent by creating, say, illustrations for websites or jingles for radio ads are right to be nervous. Like many others who see their livelihoods under threat, it\u2019s legitimate for them to protest and demand a debate about their future. And let\u2019s not forget: today\u2019s Grammy winners started out small, probably funding their first steps with run-of-the-mill creative work. Eliminate that, and you dry up the pipeline for tomorrow\u2019s superstars as well.\n\nThat is the state of play in the \u201cAI and creative work\u201d debate in a very small nutshell. However, something has always felt wrong to me about it, and I think it is its narrowness. Framing the issue as one of job loss views creativity through the economistic lens of the company boss or consultant: content in exchange for money. If there\u2019s a cheaper way to produce something that sells just as well, what\u2019s not to like? Job types have always come and gone. Is it a bane that, at least in wealthy countries, no one ploughs fields by hand anymore? And from that perspective, is automated text writing any different from using a machine, rather than hands, to sort through rubbish in a recycling plant?\n\nI think it is. Creativity is communication. People start playing music to connect with others, not to earn money. They craft lyrics to touch others, to soothe them, to express their anger, whatever. Just as people wield a paintbrush to project something onto the canvas that is still nestled somewhere between their heart and brain, they show others what they could not possibly articulate in words.\n\nCreativity is also self-reflection. People used to write diaries to order their thoughts, to delve into their feelings, and to express them. It can be a cathartic experience, or simply a calming one. If you\u2019ve tracked your life in a diary\u2014as a teenager, perhaps?\u2014you\u2019re familiar with this moment: once you listen inwardly to write down what\u2019s truly going on, things emerge that we would otherwise never articulate. Secret longings, frustrations at work, relationship troubles, fears. Diary writing is not about chronicling your life but about reflecting on it.\n\nSelf-expression, communication, and reflection help us navigate days, months, and years. If you walk around with open eyes, there is enough beauty, violence, existential questions, and agony out there to bewilder us. Whether you prefer Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony or UK Grime, here are real people making music to translate their experiences into something that resonates with fellow human beings. Others use TikTok videos or novels as their medium of choice.\n\nLong story short, creativity is a virtue that deserves nourishment (I borrow the virtue aspect from Shannon Vallor\u2019s fantastic books on philosophy and technology). Creativity, even in small doses, can help us grow into better people, happier people, for ourselves and for each other. That\u2019s why we should allow children to doodle and engage in handicrafts at school, and why a liberal arts education might encourage students to keep a diary. Even if you\u2019re not a professional painter or writer of any kind, being creative is beneficial. It fosters empathy and forges connections with others, often on a visceral level\u2014like sampling food that just tastes great, no explanation required. Creative expression can link people in the same way.\n\nBut this creativity is like a fragile plant. To blossom, it needs care, nutrients, and regular watering. Enter GenAI. Yes, algorithms are impressive at making hip-hop beats or wallpaper designs. However, the more we outsource creative work to algorithms, the more we allow creativity, as a faculty in our society, to shrivel. In theory, GenAI could be a tool to boost your creativity, producing even funkier creations (you\u2019ll find quite a bit of that in contemporary art galleries these days).\n\nBut I bet that in practice, GenAI is mostly a quick fix to produce more content more cheaply and quickly, not a means to elevate artistic expression to a whole new level. It would be a shame if people stopped making pencil drawings because, by now, DALL-E is so much better. It would also be a shame if people stopped penning poems because now Meta\u2019s Llama outperforms them.\n\nI realise that even now, hobby poets are rare. But if anything, we should want more of them, not fewer. Cultural traditions and religions around the world prize self-reflection and artistic expression. Secular thinkers like Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes hoped that technological progress would eventually free us to devote more time to play and create.\n\nThere is no news here, but that\u2019s not the world we live in in 2024, despite the abundance of new technology. We do find people in our societies who earn money through creative work\u2014even if it is rarely substantial. They combine commercial work, such as magazine illustrations, with their non-commercial projects, like pictures they give to friends as gifts. Most musicians never break through on Spotify, getting by instead on guitar or clarinet lessons for children. There is a creative stratum in society, in short, that isn\u2019t about artsy superstars but consists of people who keep alive the creative dimension of our human existence.\n\nIf these people were to lose their livelihoods, not only would their jobs disappear. The musical education for our children would also vanish, along with the creative classes at community schools, the art classes at colleges, and the entire notion that investing time in honing creative faculties is worthwhile. Algorithmic \u201ccontent production\u201d would, de facto, if not intentionally, devalue creativity in its entirety.\n\nAnd that would be a loss for all of us. Open a newspaper or your social media feed, and you find discord all around\u2014frequently in the form of deadly violence on small and large scales. This world could use all the healing it can get. And creative faculties could help. So, automating our creative side away would come with collateral damage far beyond some lost employment down the line.\n\nCompare that to the message of the recent Draghi Report. The ex-ECB boss\u2019s message to the EU was: invest and compete, or die. Digital technologies, with AI central among them, are key domains that Draghi believes need boosting. Put on narrow economistic glasses, and you can see his point. People do need jobs and cash to buy food and pay the rent. But a thriving society is not just a web of economic nodes that shuffle money and products around. So when we debate GenAI and creative activity, it is at our own peril that we sever the economic side from the rest of our existence. It is not just jobs that are at risk.",

        "text": "Winners and losers of generative AI in the freelance job market \u2013 Etla participated in an international research project\n\nA new study led by an international research team shows how Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are reshaping the workforce. The research, published on 29 January 2025 in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, analyses over three million job postings on a global freelancing platform, making it the largest study of its kind.\n\nThe large-scale study finds that the impact of Generative AI on the labour market is complex \u2013 creating opportunities in some areas while reducing demand in others.\n\nKey insights:\n\nReduction of demand in some areas\n\nIn some areas of work (such as highly repetitive writing tasks, for example), ChatGPT leads to an effective reduction of labour demand, relative to the overall labour market trend. Jobs involving skills that can be partly substituted, such as writing and translating, have seen demand drop by 20 to 50 per cent, as tools take over these tasks.\n\nNew opportunities for freelancers\n\nGenerative AI is driving demand for skills that complement Generative AI technologies. This can partially be attributed to the hype around artificial intelligence, which creates new AI-related products and services that require specialists in chatbot development or machine learning. The demand for chatbot and natural language processing jobs has almost tripled since the launch of ChatGPT.\n\nExperience matters\n\nFor skills that are substitutable by ChatGPT, such as writing and translation work, the largest reduction in demand was for experienced workers. For complementary skills like coding there was a reduction in demand for novice workers as companies sought out professionals with greater experience.\n\nGenerative AI is not destroying freelance jobs\n\nChatGPT is not the big job killer many fear; instead, the net demand for freelancing jobs has increased after the launch of ChatGPT. Generative AI is the latest trend in the long digital transformation process of the economy that started with the rise of computers and the internet.\n\n\u2013 Generative AI is accelerating the transformation of the job market; a process that started decades ago with the introduction of computers to the workplace. It is the latest development of that digitalisation process: whilst the demand for partly substitutable skills such as writing and translating has reduced, we also see new jobs being created, such as roles creating chatbots or other machine learning related jobs, says Dr Fabian Braesemann from the Oxford Internet Institute.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the use of AI, and thus its labour market impact, is still relatively limited so far,\u201d says Dr. Otto K\u00e4ssi, Etla researcher involved in the project.\n\n\u2013 More generally, our results underline the fact that the labour market effects of even potentially revolutionary technological upheavals are often slow to materialise. Although GenAI tools can already at least speed up a reasonably large part of computing work, it seems that the use of AI, and thus its labour market impact, is still relatively limited so far,\u201d says Dr. Otto K\u00e4ssi, Etla researcher involved in the project.\n\nThe study comprises a team of international researchers and industry experts exploring the impact of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT on the job market. The co-authors of this new study are Ole Teutloff and Johanna Einsiedler, from the Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science, Dr Otto K\u00e4ssi, from the ETLA Economic Research, Dr Fabian Braesemann, from the Oxford Internet Institute, Pamela Mishkin, and Assistant Professor R. Maria del Rio-Chanona, University College London and Complexity Science Hub Vienna.\n\nAbout the research\n\nThe research was based on a large-scale data analysis of job postings from a leading online freelance platform using software analysis tool BERTopic and others during January 2021 and September 2023, covering around one year of data before and after the introduction of ChatGPT.",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence technologies are unlocking new economic opportunities in Singapore. Outsizing the city states\u2019 limited manpower, AI is increasing Singapore\u2019s manufacturing output, optimizing customs facilitation, creating new jobs, and spurring innovation.\n\nThough many in Singapore are poised to benefit from the adoption of AI technologies, including automation and robotization, some will not. Low-wage migrant workers, who have long played a critical role in the country\u2019s economy and relationships with its neighbors, are extremely vulnerable to job displacement. As AI automation shifts conceptions of value and expertise, challenges may compound for workers long treated as expendable in the world\u2019s most expensive city.\n\nConcerns about job security in the age of artificial intelligence are ubiquitous. However, Singapore\u2019s ambitions for global leadership in AI have fueled efforts to upskill and future-proof the workforce from these anxieties. Since 2015, Singapore\u2019s proactive SkillsFuture Initiative has provided citizens and residents over the age of 25 subsidized access to thousands of courses and job transition support. In 2023 alone, about 520,000 individuals participated in training programs supported by the initiative. Today, Singapore\u2019s workforce is considered the world\u2019s-fastest in adopting AI skills.\n\nSingapore\u2019s lifelong learning initiatives have been lauded as an example of inclusive workforce development. Notably, SkillsFuture subsidies are increased for those more traditionally disadvantaged in digital adoption, including older professionals and people with disabilities. However, the exclusion of migrant workers from these programs challenges Singapore\u2019s expressed commitment to inclusivity. Many of these workers already accrue substantial debt from basic training and certification fees needed to work in Singapore, let alone additional expenses to develop digital skills.\n\nWithout careful regulations, artificial intelligence will exacerbate socioeconomic divides between workers in Singapore and across the region. Singapore must evaluate its responsibilities to the transnational division of labor as it sets an example for AI adoption. To start, the challenges that AI poses to the region\u2019s low-wage workers must be included in Singapore\u2019s domestic and foreign policy discussions.\n\nOf the city-state\u2019s 1.4 million foreign workers in 2019, 999,000 were low-wage work permit holders. With the prospect of higher wages in Singapore, workers from South and Southeast Asia move to the city state for roles in construction, manufacturing, shipping, services, and domestic work. Migrant workers fill crucial gaps for jobs that resident Singaporeans see as undesirable, accounting for about one out of three low-wage service jobs in Singapore. This relationship allows Singapore to hold its unemployment rate steady even as labor demand ebbs and flows\u2014taking in migrant laborers when they are needed and sending them home when they are not.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic was a harrowing display of the exploitative nature of this cycle. With economic uncertainty, border closures, and spikes in xenophobic sentiment, foreign workers were the hardest hit by country-wide unemployment. In total,181,500 foreigners in Singapore lost their jobs at the height of the pandemic\u2014far exceeding foreign unemployment during prior financial crises. With tightened restrictions on foreign work permits, many migrant workers suddenly had to uproot their lives and leave the country. During this period, those classified as \u201clow-skilled\u201d foreign workers made up 76 percent of job losses.\n\nTechnological adoption spurred by the pandemic may render some job losses permanent. A joint survey by Microsoft and IDC Asia Pacific found that nearly three quarters of Singapore's firms accelerated their pace of digitalization due to Covid-19. At the same time, Singapore increased its deployment of AI-powered robots, particularly in sectors normally occupied by migrant workers. To keep up with these changes, it is estimated that Singapore needs 1.2 million additional digitally skilled workers to join its workforce by 2025. As a result, many more may be forced to leave Singapore\u2019s workforce.\n\nOxford Economics estimates that each new industrial robot wipes out 1.6 manufacturing jobs, with the least-skilled regions of a country doubly as affected as higher-skilled regions. As the second most robot-dense country in the world, the socioeconomic impacts of robotization are substantial. Singapore now has 730 industrial robots per every 10,000 employees, with an average 27 percent increase each year since 2015. During this same period, employment in Singapore\u2019s manufacturing sector decreased every year, even as Singapore\u2019s manufacturing industry grew. The seemingly inverse correlation between employment rate and economic output underscores a shifting valuation of manual labor in Singapore.\n\nArtificial intelligence may exacerbate the dehumanization and devaluation of migrant worker contributions to Singapore. For workers, this may result in lower wages and worse standards of living and employment. Conditions for migrant workers in Singapore are already subpar. Migrants from India and Bangladesh make one-sixth of the average Singaporean salary, and during the Covid-19 pandemic, segregated dormitories for Singapore\u2019s foreign workers received international attention for their deplorable state.\n\nSingapore\u2019s changing labor demands also impact neighboring countries. According to Singapore University of Social Sciences economist Walter Theseira, when jobless migrant workers return home, they bring the societal costs of unemployment with them. These challenges exacerbate for even poorer populations in source countries. Working experience in Singapore could give former migrant workers an advantage for employment in their home countries, which might displace those who never had the funds or opportunity to leave.\n\nSingapore undermines its commitments to narrowing the development gap among member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and leading inclusive AI adoption if it does not address its role in the looming wave of transnational unemployment. The global push for AI regulation-setting is an opportune time for Singapore to introduce reforms for ethical, responsible, and mutually empowering labor migration.\n\nThe first change is sociocultural. With AI automation redefining productivity, it is more important than ever for Singapore to distinguish an individual\u2019s economic contributions from their personal skill and success. After all, one in five migrant workers are employed as foreign domestic workers, making invaluable contributions to the care of Singaporean families despite little economic acknowledgment or compensation for reproductive labor.\n\nThe language of \u201clow-skilled\u201d to describe work that requires little to no professional training devalues social and vocational contributions of Singapore\u2019s lowest paid workers. A preoccupation with efficiency may distort conceptions of what it means to be human and what it means to be Singaporean in the digital age. A notable example is Singapore\u2019s centuries-old hawker culture, which is at high risk of disappearing as more youth aspire to become professionals, managers, executives, or technicians (PMETs) in Singapore. Rethinking Singapore\u2019s \u201clow-skilled,\u201d \u201csemi-skilled,\u201d and \u201chigh-skilled\u201d labels can reverse dehumanizing perceptions and practices towards foreign workers as well as foster a more constructive society-wide relationship with artificial intelligence.\n\nSecondly, Singapore should push to safeguard rights for AI-affected migrant workers in Southeast Asia. One worker rights organization proposes that Singapore establish a buffer period for displaced workers to find a new job before facing deportation. Setting an ASEAN-wide standard could help protect workers on every level of the intraregional labor market. Additionally, Singapore should lead research efforts to examine how AI will influence job displacement and skill demands in the region. Regular reports on these trends can prepare the integrated economies for potential labor supply shocks, while also informing working-age individuals on how to enhance their competitiveness in line with the bloc\u2019s longer-term digital economy goals.\n\nWhile these initiatives might offer greater benefits to worker-sending nations than to Singapore, taking leadership on ASEAN-wide labor rights could signify that Singapore recognizes the contributions of foreign workers to the city-state\u2019s success story. This generates potential to enhance Singapore\u2019s relationships with its neighbors, address past controversies regarding worker rights violations, and position Singapore as a leader in both AI and its ethical adoption.\n\nAs Singapore integrates artificial intelligence technologies across its economy, the rights and future of Singapore's low-wage migrant workers will become an increasingly pressing issue for Southeast Asia. The international community must pay attention to how Singapore\u2019s decisions set a precedent for AI in the global landscape of labor.\n\nTappy Lung is a research intern with the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.",

        "text": "Almost three quarters (73%) of employees in European companies have already had practical experience with artificial intelligence\n\nMost employees in Europe use AI in their private lives (38%), relatively few for their work (12%) Almost a quarter of respondents use AI in both areas (23%)\n\nRespondents are not satisfied with the level of AI training and opportunities they receive at work\n\nIn Switzerland (57%), Germany (59%) and the Netherlands (64%), concerns about job losses due to AI are comparatively low\n\nZurich, 15 July 2024 - Artificial intelligence has taken the economy by storm and is on the rise - but to what extent is this new technology already shaping the everyday working lives of companies and employees in Europe and how ready are they for the AI transformation process? Although some employees are ready to experiment with AI, others are still reluctant: almost three quarters of all respondents (73%) have already had practical experience with the new technology. However, most of them use AI in their private lives (38%), with far fewer respondents stating that they use AI at work (12%). The remaining respondents (23%) have experience with AI in both areas.\n\n\n\nIn terms of countries, the proportion of employees who already use AI in practice is highest in Spain (84%), followed by Switzerland (82%) and Italy (77%). At the other end of the scale are the Netherlands (66%), Germany (67%) and Austria (69%). Across all countries surveyed, men (75%) are more likely to have experience with AI applications than women (70%). There are also differences between the hierarchy levels: More than 84% of executives say they use or have used AI applications, compared to only 67% of non-executives.\n\nThese are the results of the first EY European AI Barometer, for which 4,741 employees in nine European countries were surveyed. In addition to Switzerland, these countries include Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal.\n\nJob losses due to AI - concern lowest in Switzerland\n\n\n\nWhen asked whether the use of AI will lead to job losses, the opinions of respondents in the European countries differ. Overall, slightly more than two out of three respondents (68%) said that they expect fewer employees to be needed as AI systems become more established and the range of applications increases\n\nIn Switzerland (57%), Germany (59%) and the Netherlands (64%), concerns about the loss of jobs due to AI are comparatively low. This percentage is particularly high in Portugal (80%), Spain (78%), Italy (76%) and Belgium (74%). Adrian Ott, Chief AI Officer at EY in Switzerland, says: \"As a country with a high density of well-qualified workers and a lower number of routine jobs, the use of AI tends to be perceived as an opportunity rather than a threat.\"\n\nThere is a general consensus among respondents in the nine countries analyzed when it comes to the influence of AI on their own work: more than one in two (53%) state that AI applications will influence their own work - or are already doing so. In Italy and Switzerland (both 59%), the figure is almost six in ten. The proportion is also above average in the Netherlands (57%), Austria and Germany (56%). In contrast, it is below average in France (47%), Belgium (48%) and Spain and Portugal (49% each).\n\nMost respondents expect AI to take over parts of their work (65%), with some assuming that they will hand over part of their workload to AI in the near future (14%).\n\nHowever, an interesting dichotomy emerges in that a not insignificant proportion of respondents believe it is unlikely that AI will take over parts of their work (35%). And of those who expect to hand over some of their workload, the vast majority do not see this happening in the foreseeable future. Adrian Ott says: \"The effects of AI are not yet tangible in all areas. Regulatory complexity and initial failures in the use of AI can lead to mistrust of the technology. It is important that companies and employees prepare themselves for dealing with the new technologies and closely monitor upcoming AI developments so that they are not suddenly overwhelmed by the advances.\"\n\nEmployees dissatisfied with AI training\n\n\n\nAccording to the survey results, not enough respondents are satisfied with the level of AI training they receive at work. Switzerland leads the way in terms of training provision, with 36% of employees surveyed saying that their employer provides sufficient training. In other countries, employers clearly need to do much better, particularly in Portugal, where only 14% of employees are satisfied with the current level of AI training they receive. Most employees want live training and workshops (43%), followed by online courses (38%).\n\nIn many cases, employees are taking the initiative to take advantage of self-study opportunities, whether personal, professional or a combination of both. Self-learning in the field of AI is most widespread in Switzerland (60%), Italy (54%) and Spain (54%). Employees in Germany are the least likely to train themselves (37%). Roger Spichiger, AI Leader Financial Services at EY in Switzerland, says: \"The fact that many of those surveyed are continuing their education privately shows the current assessment of the importance of AI skills for the future labor market. At the same time, companies should see this as an opportunity to position themselves as attractive employers by investing in training programs.\"\n\nAI is already helping companies to save costs and increase profits\n\n\n\nDespite the challenges, the benefits of using AI are already evident, particularly in terms of cost savings: Across Europe, almost half of managers (45%) say that they have been able to save costs or increase profits - or both - by using AI. Measured against these two criteria, the use of AI has so far been most successful in Switzerland, where 81% of managers have had positive experiences with the technology. The proportion of confident managers in Spain (60%) and Italy (58%) is also above average. In contrast, respondents in Austria, the Netherlands and Germany (34% each) are less impressed.\n\nIs investment in AI a top priority for companies? Across Europe, almost four in ten respondents (38%) say \"yes\". Employees in Switzerland (57%), Spain (54%), Italy (48%) and France (46%) are most likely to agree that AI will be a top investment priority in the coming year. Respondents in Austria (22%) and Germany (25%) are significantly less likely to share this opinion.\n\nAdrian Ott says: \"In the overall context of the Swiss figures, it is fair to say that Switzerland is taking the potential of AI seriously and, as an innovative high-price country with a strong export orientation, does not want to miss out on the global connection. The focus is not on the fear of losing one's own job, but on the innovative power and opportunities that will arise from AI technologies in the near future.\"\n\nWhat are the future possibilities of AI? Around 82% of respondents from the financial services and technology, media and telecommunications sectors are optimistic about the development opportunities of the technology. A clear majority of respondents from the energy (80%), advanced manufacturing and mobility (77%), agriculture (73%) and insurance (72%) sectors also share this opinion.",

Jobs with \"low exposure\" include barbers, child care workers, firefighters, dishwashers and pipelayers.\n\nAccording to the report, there are already more than 2,000 AI-related startups in the city, with 40,000 workers in the field and those connected to it in the metropolitan area.\n\n\u201cWithout question it\u2019s going to have a big impact on Long Island\u2019s economy as it I think it will on the U.S. economy overall,\u201d said Paul Trapani, cofounder of software consultancy PassTech Development LLC, and president of Plainview-based technology trade group LISTNet. His own firm, which has three employees, has been using ChatGPT\u2019s paid premium tools to help with rapid prototyping of software and speeding up development processes.\n\nSign up for the Breaking News newsletter Get the latest breaking news as it happens.

Rather than having to go and look things up like how to do something in a program language, we can get that instantly.\u201d\n\nTrapani acknowledged that with increased productivity comes the risk of job loss, particularly for those who perform repetitive tasks like data entry. Entry-level jobs in tech could also be harder for new grads to land.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unfair to younger people because businesses may not need to make as many hires,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be a little tougher for someone to break in. Companies don\u2019t want to hire unless they have to.\u201d\n\nWhile the report warns that artificial intelligence possibly could displace workers, retail jobs that were lost during the pandemic \u201care likely permanently displaced, caused by advances in automation and shifts to e-commerce.\u201d At each retail establishment, there was an average of one fewer worker (10.6 in 2019 compared to 9.6 in 2023), according to the report.\n\nThat trend is a continuation of a decline that predates the pandemic and began during the middle of the 2010s, but it\u2019s worse in New York City than nationally, says the report, \u201cState of the New York City Economy 2024,\u201d issued by the Economic Development Corporation, an arm of the city.\n\nThe likely permanence of remote and hybrid work, turbocharged during the pandemic, continues.\n\nThe effect is especially pronounced in parts of Manhattan frequented by office workers, and \u201cwe have seen a significant increase in vacant storefronts.\u201d\n\nCitywide, there were about 16,200 vacant storefronts, or 11.3%, through 2024\u2019s second quarter, compared with 15,300 (10.5%) during 2020\u2019s first quarter.\n\nAll of this, the report summarizes as \u201cA New Normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cStorefront vacancy spiked but is trending downward as growth in restaurants and bars continues to shift the character of New York City streets,\u201d the report says. \u201cAs the city moves forward, these trends are unlikely to change. The same technology that allows us to work from home and shop online will continue to challenge commercial corridors in traditional business districts as well as traditional retailers while creating opportunities for business growth in boroughs outside Manhattan.\u201d\n\nThe report calls the scarcity of housing \u201cthe defining challenge\u201d \u2014 the record-low 1.4% rental vacancy rate, which drives up housing costs in a city where two-thirds of households rent.\n\nEven as the city added 895,000 jobs between 2011 and 2023, only 353,000 housing units were added to the stock.\n\nLong Island is doing even worse on building housing to meet demand \u2014 and housing shortages regionwide drive up costs everywhere in the region.\n\nAmong America's 100 largest counties, Nassau and Suffolk permitted less housing per capita from 2013 to 2022 than all but one county in Ohio, according to Bloomberg News.",

In other words, those being able to harness AI power will be the most in-demand.\n\n\"AI and robotics would soon replace humans in many jobs as these technologies would create a new class of AI labour that never tires, needs no bonuses, and never takes sick leave,\" said Ti\u1ebfn.\n\nHe predicts that 85 per cent of workers doing repetitive tasks could be at risk of job loss in the short term. They will have no choice but to adapt, or else fall behind.\n\nHe also draws a parallel between the past struggle against illiteracy and the current need to combat 'technological illiteracy'.\n\nKingsman Academy's President Ho\u00e0ng Trung D\u0169ng cites online learning platforms as a cost-effective and flexible way for young people to upskill their technological proficiency.\n\nHowever, with a vast array of courses available, the challenge lies in selecting the right ones to meet personal needs.\n\nTr\u1ea7n Th\u00e0nh Nam, Vice-Rector of the University of Education under the Vietnam National University, warns that AI's rapid development will pose new challenges to education as students who lack critical thinking would be misled by AI-generated content.\n\nHe stressed the need to adapt education to prepare students for an AI-driven world. They must be taught to harness AI as a tool, not become reliant on it. A major concern is the risk of creating a generation that is overly dependent on technology and lacks creativity.\n\nHe suggests a balanced approach that combines AI with human ingenuity, which involves teaching people to critically evaluate AI-generated information and use it effectively, to ensure AI serves as a catalyst for progress rather than a hindrance.\n\nA recent report from the General Statistics Office of Vi\u1ec7t Nam paints a picture of a labour market in flux. While the country boasts 51.4 million employed individuals, a staggering 61 per cent are engaged in informal sectors, highlighting a significant skills gap.\n\nAlarmingly, 70 per cent of the workforce lacks basic vocational training, hindering their access to stable, well-paying jobs both domestically and abroad. This skills gap is particularly pronounced for young people seeking careers in the rapidly evolving tech sector.\n\nExperts predict a seismic shift in the job landscape over the next decade. Many traditional roles, such as accountants, bank tellers and data entry clerks, are expected to decline or vanish entirely.\n\nMeanwhile, the demand for tech-savvy professionals in fields like AI, machine learning, cybersecurity and digital finance is set to skyrocket.\n\nThis transformation underscores the urgent need for upskilling and reskilling initiatives. Vi\u1ec7t Nam's workforce must adapt to the demands of the digital age to remain competitive in the global market. \u2014 VNS",

        "text": "So where might this take us a couple of years ahead? We believe that AI does have the potential to fundamentally transform most of the work tasks that exist today, meaning that the way people do their jobs will evolve drastically. Interpreters, translators, survey researchers, writers, mathematicians, web designers, accountants, auditors, journalists, blockchain engineers, tax preparers and financial managers are all occupations which have a high exposure to AI in the sense that many tasks of these occupations can, in theory, be performed by generative AI (Eloundou, et al., 2023).\n\nBut what will be the final impact on these professions? Will they disappear and be replaced by autonomous AI? Or will they continue to exist alongside AI, potentially benefiting from productivity gains? This is where the real question lies. The development of AI is such an important revolution for the labour market that it is not enough to look at the exposure of each profession to AI to be able to make conclusions about the impact of AI on the labour market. We also need to consider the question of substitution or complementarity with AI, i.e., the likelihood of AI complementing or replacing human work. To date, the most comprehensive approach in the literature for incorporating both the AI exposure aspect and the complementarity vs. substitution aspect into the analysis is that of the IMF (International Monetary Fund).\n\nThis new approach by the IMF considers not only job tasks, but also social, ethical, and physical aspects of occupations, as well as the skill levels required. This makes it possible to take into account aspects linked to communication (the subtleties of face-to-face interaction and the art of public speaking remain largely the domain of humans), responsibility (the responsibility and ethical decision-making inherent in certain tasks, for example in the field of human health, require human supervision, judgement and, above all, compassion), exposure to external environments and physical proximity to other people (which require a high level of adaptability and sensory acuity)... According to this approach, occupations can be classified into 3 groups2:\n\nhigh exposure, high complementarity high exposure, low complementarity low exposure\n\nHigh-exposure, high-complementarity occupations have significant potential for AI support, as AI can complement workers in their tasks and decision-making. However, the potential for unsupervised use of AI in these roles is limited. These are mainly cognitive jobs involving a high degree of responsibility and interpersonal interaction, such as those performed by surgeons, lawyers, and judges. In these roles, workers can potentially benefit from the productivity advantages of AI, provided they have the necessary skills to interact with the technology. High-exposure, low-complementarity occupations, on the other hand, are well placed to incorporate AI, but AI is more likely to replace human tasks. This could lead to lower demand for labour and slower wage growth for these jobs. Telemarketers are a prime example. In the US, the number of jobs labelled telemarketers decreased by 49.5% between 2012 and 2019. Finally, \"low exposure occupations\" have minimal or no potential for AI application. This group encompasses a wide range of occupations, from dishwashers to artists and beyond.",

A new report suggests the financial sector could be on the verge of experiencing a significant shift that includes eliminating many jobs in the coming years as companies increase reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThese projections have significant implications for the future of work, particularly as AI continues to revolutionize other industries. However, according to experts who hire finance professionals, the reports may not be entirely correct.\n\nA new report has raised concerns regarding Wall Street eliminating jobs in favor of AI systems.Astrakan Images via Getty Images\n\nExperts weigh in on the future of work on Wall Street\n\nOn January 9, Bloomberg reported that its research-intelligence arm had conducted an extensive analysis on how the rise of AI may impact financial services jobs in the coming years.\n\nAfter surveying many banking and technology professionals, the authors concluded that thousands of Wall Street jobs could be eliminated in the coming years as AI becomes increasingly prevalent in the workplace.\n\nRelated: Big tech leader slams President Biden for new AI policy proposals\n\nIf these projections are correct, Wall Street could shed as many as 200,000 jobs in the next 3-5 years. Tomasz Noetzel, the senior analyst at Bloomberg responsible for the report, notes that of the many jobs in the financial services industry, positions in areas such as back and middle office and operations are the most likely to be impacted by AI.\n\nWhile Noetzel believes that \u201cany jobs involving routine, repetitive tasks are at risk,\u201d he adds that AI isn\u2019t likely to eradicate them completely. Rather, he sees this fast-growing technology ultimately leading to a workforce transformation for the entire industry.\n\nThis change is largely seen as positive from a financial employer\u2019s perspective, and it could benefit investors as well. Of the surveyed professionals, eight out of 10 respondents indicate that they believe increasing use of generative AI in the workplace will boost both productivity and revenue by at least 5% during the specified 3-5 year period.\n\nOne company that sees AI as enhancing its work, not replacing workers, is commercial real estate investment firm JLL.

        "text": "The deployment of AI in the workplace has shined a light on long-standing problems: The deployment of AI-powered technologies in the workplace has been associated with an array of worker experiences and outcomes that warrant concern, including discrimination, unsafe working conditions, loss of privacy, and seemingly arbitrary disciplinary action or discharge, among others.\n\nThis is a joint project with the Center for American Progress, Congressional Progressive Caucus Center, and National Employment Law Project.\n\nBut these outcomes are not inherent to the use of AI. Employers\u2019 use of other technologies and even garden-variety management practices have perpetuated these outcomes for decades. The use of AI has shined a light on the challenges workers with little bargaining power and insufficient on-the-job protections face in our labor market.\n\nBroader solutions are needed to improve worker outcomes in the era of AI: Policymakers should address the negative outcomes experienced by workers today, but they also should look beyond how the use of specific AI systems may degrade job quality and look deeper to the underlying conditions that enable employers to use AI in this manner: the imbalance of power between businesses and their workers.\n\nWorkers should have greater protections and a voice in workplace policies: Decades of weakened bargaining power and heavy reliance on employers for life necessities, such as healthcare and retirement, has made it exceedingly difficult for most workers to bargain over how AI technologies are being used in the workplace\u2014let alone opt out of the use of AI-powered management and surveillance at work or walk away from unlawful or poor working conditions.\n\nThe objective of worker-centered AI policy: Increase the ability of workers to meaningfully engage their employers in how AI technologies are deployed in the workplace.\n\nTo achieve this straightforward objective, policymakers will need to address long-standing imbalances in the labor market; reduce AI-specific barriers to worker voice while banning the most egregious uses of AI; and support workers\u2019 ability to find better jobs.\n\nPillar one: Expand and expedite pathways to collective bargaining\n\nThe impact of AI technologies on workers is not only a function of the current state of technology, but also the institutions and policies that shape how it is implemented in firms across the United States. AI-focused policies must include steps to rebalance workers\u2019 labor market power and ensure most workers can bargain collectively so they can shape how management tools\u2014including AI\u2014are implemented.\n\nCongress should redouble its effort to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. Congress should also consider other incremental steps, such as clarifying workers\u2019 rights to bargain about AI, as well as broader approaches to increasing worker voice, including through sectoral bargaining or tripartite boards.\n\nPillar two: Reduce AI-specific barriers to worker voice and strengthen employment protections\n\nOpaque management practices and production processes make it exceedingly difficult for workers to express their voice about how their workplace is organized and run\u2014AI systems exacerbate this problem.\n\nPolicymakers should increase transparency around firm-level use of AI technologies by requiring employers to disclose their use of electronic monitoring, surveillance, and automated decision-making systems, as well as employment related-data and decisions produced by such systems, in a manner that is actionable for workers and their representatives.\n\nMany labor and employment laws today already prohibit many things that workers who are using or subject to AI are experiencing. Businesses\u2019 use of AI, in some cases, is skirting workers\u2019 existing rights and facilitating the shifting of work into more underpaid and precarious structures, like gig work. In other cases, existing law is not sufficient for protecting workers from the worst abuses, whether they stem from AI decision-making and surveillance technologies or older forms of exploitation.\n\nCongress should adequately fund worker protection agencies\u2014such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Department of Labor\u2014which have all issued various forms of guidance clarifying the applicability of relevant laws to the use of AI technologies.\n\nPolicymakers and federal agencies should more fully leverage existing authorities to address problematic workplace outcomes that have been exacerbated by the use of AI technologies by issuing new guidance and regulatory standards to address issues related to discrimination, unsafe working conditions, and obscuring the employment relationship.\n\nCongress should ban the use of AI-assisted decision-making processes for firing and disciplinary actions that do not include human involvement, and should require employers using any AI-assisted systems for such decisions to establish due process procedures administered by human supervisors\u2014including meaningful opportunities to correct faulty data and adequate warning before termination.\n\nCongress should ban invasive kinds of workplace surveillance, including facial and emotional recognition, monitoring a worker\u2019s activities related to a labor organization, and predicting the behavior of a worker or collecting health information unrelated to job duties.\n\nCongress should regulate employer use of automated decision-making systems to prevent dangerous risks to the safety, security, or health of workers, clients, or the public that may result from automated decisions related to staffing.\n\nPillar three: Increase workers\u2019 ability to leave employers who create exploitative conditions with AI (or other technologies and practices) and ease job transitions\n\nOne of the most effective solutions to easing the impact of any AI-related job transition for workers is strengthening the social insurance system. Similarly, one of the strongest moves workers can play when they are in a job with poor working conditions\u2014because of the use of AI or other management practices\u2014is finding another job. A strong social insurance system and low unemployment will increase the ability of workers to leave bad jobs.",

Xiaochen Zhang Founder and Chief AI Officer, AI 2030\n\nHowever, despite these looming changes, the era of AI completely taking over human tasks has not yet arrived.\n\nAccording to Zhang, in the current market, humans still play a fundamental role, and machines have yet to replace them, with the current focus being more on human-machine collaboration.\n\n\"Every job potentially will be redesigned under the concept of human-machine collaborative intelligence,\" Zhang said.\n\n\u201cThis concept itself is very powerful where the machine will take on much bigger roles than before where it is not a tool anymore, it is part of the work itself,\" he added.\n\nWhile AI's presence in the workplace is not a new phenomenon, more research confirms its potential impact on the jobs market, especially during the hiring stage.\n\nRelated The 5 new jobs being created in Europe because of AI\n\nA joint report from LinkedIn and Microsoft revealed that 66 per cent of leaders would not consider hiring candidates lacking AI skills.\n\nAdditionally, the report showed that 71 per cent would likely choose a less experienced candidate with AI capabilities over a more experienced one without such skills.\n\nPeople are taking matters into their own hands by learning to use AI tools and incorporating them into their professional tasks, with 75 per cent of knowledge workers admitting to using AI in the workplace, the report also found.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe top AI skill for the current job market\n\nWhile AI has yet to fully take over human tasks, not all jobs are expected to be affected equally, and some might even risk disappearing.\n\n\"As part of humans wanting to remain competitive in the jobs market, competing with other humans, AI is becoming the differentiation factor,\" Zhang said.\n\nFor instance, Zhang explains that the creative industry is on the verge of a huge change as AI technology gets better.\n\nSome tasks, such as content creation, design, research, and editing, could easily be conducted with AI tools that are constantly improving in terms of quality and efficiency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe solution, according to Zhang, is mastering the use of those AI tools and leveraging these skills to redesign the way work is conducted.\n\nFor example, people can learn how to effectively prompt and communicate with large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, which are continuously acquiring more advanced capabilities.\n\nBy mastering these skills, professionals can capitalise on the rising demand for proficiency in using AI tools.\n\nWhile it is important to adopt AI tools and learn how to use them, people could also focus on improving the skills that distinguish them from AI, experts say.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAuthenticity and human creation, according to Zhang, could become more valuable, as human creativity is fueled by life experiences that machines can\u2019t replicate.\n\nBut he sees it as companies\u2019 responsibility to redesign the way work is conducted to leverage people\u2019s skills for better human-machine collaboration.",

        "text": "XH4D/Getty Images\n\nThis is the year when artificial intelligence (AI) moves from the margins to the mainstream. While some companies have been using AI and machine-learning technologies to boost operational performance for several years, fewer organizations have found ways to put generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, into production.\n\nAlso: Agile development can unlock the power of generative AI - here's how\n\nYou can expect that trend to change this year as more organizations explore and exploit generative AI, said David Brodeur-Johnson, principal analyst at Forrester, to ZDNET.\n\n\"2024 will be the year that firms get serious about applying generative AI to their internal data sources and making information and insights available to their employees to help them do their jobs even better.\"\n\nResearch shows AI spending in 2024 will more than double over levels seen in 2023, equating to an average of $2.5 million per company, according to a survey by Rackspace Technology and Amazon Web Services.\n\nAlso: Generative AI is the technology that IT feels most pressure to exploit\n\nBut while employers are looking to introduce automation, many employees are concerned that increased use of technologies like generative AI is far from good news.\n\nForrester's research suggests as many as 86% of US employees fear that many people will lose their jobs to AI and automation, and almost a third (31%) believe that trend will manifest during the next two to five years.\n\nDigital leaders responding to a global survey from recruiter Nash Squared come to similar conclusions, with 17% being the average percentage of jobs digital leaders feel will be lost to automation.\n\nYet context is important. While there's an understandable focus on the fear many roles could be automated away, there's less analysis of how AI could boost worker efficiency and productivity and increase economic activity and growth.\n\nDebra Bonomi, head of learning and development at e-commerce giant Rakuten, has initiated a program with ELB Learning at her organization to help staff upskill for the upsurge in AI -- and she said employees in all areas of business must embrace change.\n\n\"This isn't something to be afraid of,\" she told ZDNET. \"The only thing we should be afraid of is if we continue to be the person who says, 'Oh, I don't need it. It's not going to impact me.' Those are the people whose jobs will be impacted negatively.\"\n\nAlso: Generative AI can transform customer experiences. But only if you focus on other areas first\n\nBonomi said her organization is committed to exploring the benefits of AI. The company has partnered with OpenAI to create an internal version of ChatGPT, and Rakuten employees can already see benefits.\n\n\"It's not only going to make us more efficient, but it's going to change our jobs,\" she said. \"Not everyone will lose their jobs, but we may be doing very different tasks, roles, and responsibilities in the future. There's nothing to fear, as long as we're okay with that change and we keep adapting along the way.\"\n\nThat sentiment resonates with Bev White, CEO at recruiter Nash Squared, who told ZDNET it's important not to jump to conclusions just yet despite the likelihood that AI will lead to big changes in the job market.\n\nShe said the story of the introduction of automation -- from the Industrial Revolution to our present digital age -- has always revolved around fears that jobs will be cut.\n\nWhile AI and automation will lead to the end of some roles, the tools should also help change many workplaces and work roles for the better.\n\nAlso: 4 ways to help your organization overcome AI inertia\n\nWhite refers to software development and quotes research that suggests developers who use GitHub Copilot complete tasks 55% faster than developers who don't.\n\nThe same research found between 60% and 75% of developers report that using generative AI tools as part of their roles leaves them feeling more fulfilled, less frustrated when coding, and able to focus on more satisfying work.\n\n\"Emerging technology is speeding things up,\" said White. \"It's taking human processes out -- which are repetitive, and not necessarily interesting for a human being to do -- and replacing them with automated ways of doing things faster.\"\n\nEven with increased levels of automation, companies will still need a human in the loop to ensure processes are completed effectively, such as dealing with more complicated customer service requests.\n\nWhite said the tactical deployment of AI and automation should mean professionals will have an increased opportunity to focus on crucial business areas.\n\n\"People will be able to do things, not only faster, but more cheaply and spend more time on the human elements -- the thinking time, the decision-making time -- that are essential to value-added processes.\"\n\nNigel Richardson, SVP & CIO Europe at PepsiCo, is another business leader who said AI will boost worker efficiency and productivity.\n\n\"Generative AI will be a huge augmenter to people's work rather than fully replacing it,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course, some elements of jobs will get replaced. But I think history shows that when you've got disruptive technologies, they usually create more jobs than they destroy.\"\n\nAlso: 5 ways CIOs can manage the business demand for generative AI\n\nRichardson said to ZDNET that the professionals who will benefit from the rise of AI are likely to be those who embrace change.\n\n\"You need to have a mindset of being a lifelong learner,\" he said. \"The people I see being successful are always open to learning new things. You're mistaken if you learn one thing and think it will last you for your career.\"\n\nThe key message from business leaders is that professionals must shift their feelings on AI from dread to confidence.\n\nBen Elms, chief executive officer at internet connectivity specialist Expereo, told ZDNET that almost every technological innovation implementation comes with a side order of fear.\n\n\"If you approach AI as, 'It's going to change the world, and it's going to put people out of jobs,' well, it isn't -- it's going to create even more opportunity and jobs,\" he said.\n\nElms said the key to success is finding the right use cases. He gave an example from his own company, which is based on resolving customer service requests, many of which require a standard answer.\n\n\"These are highly repeatable tasks,\" he said. \"These requests are text-based and many of the answers can be served effectively by AI quickly. That capability means people can come out of the service function, I can give them more training, and they can be frontline people, enhancing the customer experience.\"\n\nAlso: 5 ways to prepare for the impact of generative AI on the IT profession\n\nHari Ramamurthy, technology fellow at The Home Depot, is another business leader who said AI and automation can help workers focus on more interesting work.\n\n\"We definitely see it as something that will improve the productivity of our associates and help them with the laborious, monotonous aspects of what they're working on.\"\n\nRamamurthy recently explained to me how the retail giant has developed a machine learning-powered app called Sidekick to boost staff productivity.\n\nThe app, which also uses computer vision, helps shopfloor staff identify items in hard-to-find locations.\n\n\"It was painful to try and search for some of our products overhead. Sometimes, an item is not exactly where you expect it to be,\" he said.\n\n\"But technologies like computer vision help staff locate those products easier. And it's that sort of mindset that we have in terms of how we can augment the capabilities of our associates by improving their productivity so we can serve the customers better.\"\n\nA recent research report by Goldman Sachs suggests the average increase in productivity from companies that have been early to adopt generative AI is about 25%.\n\nThese AI-enabled boosts could offer staff at public-facing organizations a way to cut the drudgery of repetitive work and focus on potentially life-changing activities.\n\nAlso: Want to be a data scientist? Do these 4 things, according to business leaders\n\nMichelle Smith, program manager at Barnardo's, a UK charity that supports more than 370,000 children, young people, parents, and caregivers, said the smart use of AI could help people focus on the frontline services that matter most.\n\n\"Relationships keep us running,\" she told ZDNET. \"It's where people get the most joy from work and it's what motivates people. We work for a purpose. If you're stuck in front of a screen too much, and not interacting with your colleagues, it becomes painful.\"\n\nSmith said generative AI tools could help the charity to cut the administrative bind and give people more time to think, collaborate, and make decisions.\n\n\"I've worked in operational roles for years and there's loads of things where I think, 'Oh, I'd rather be speaking to a person than the tedious process of checking paperwork,'\" she said.\n\n\"It would be great if we could get people freed up from processes and allow them to be creative in their roles by taking advantage of emerging technology. I'm keen for my colleagues who are still in operational roles to be given the opportunity to develop new skills.\"",

        "text": "Technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), must be deflationary to have a macroeconomic impact. It can reduce costs and prices and boost real incomes and demand, thereby creating new jobs and offsetting automation-driven losses.\n\nPredictions of technological unemployment have repeatedly proven false, as macroeconomic job creation in new sectors offsets microeconomic disruptions.\n\nAI is likely to increase productivity and wealth, with new jobs emerging; the focus should be on managing sector-specific disruptions, not fearing labour market dystopia.\n\nIn 1983, Wassily Leontief, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, concluded that human labour would go the way of the horse after the automobile arrived \u2013 \u201cfirst diminished and then eliminated.\u201d\n\nToday, a new wave of doomsaying has emerged surrounding \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d as AI, with its promise of business innovation, has marched to the forefront of economic debate. Pundits argue we\u2019re now drifting towards a \u201cworld without work\u201d where machines produce all things and algorithms provide all services. Outclassed humans serve no role in this macroeconomic dystopia.\n\nAs we argue in Shocks, Crises, and False Alarms, predictions of technology-driven job destruction have a long history and correspondingly, a long record of failure. Angst about worker obsolescence ebbs and flows with each new generation of technology. The threat from automation was once deemed so dire that Bill Gates proposed a \u201crobot tax\u201d on companies choosing robots over human labour to soften the blow of its impact on workers.\n\nYet, amid relentless technological progress over the past 80 years, during which the labour market has been remade \u2013 and then remade again \u2013 the US economy has added 120 million jobs. In 2024, as the unemployment rate remains historically low and real wages are growing, few remember Gates\u2019 robot tax idea.\n\nThe deflationary nature of technology\n\nThough it remains a popular narrative today, the failed predictions of technological unemployment have not been lost on all economists. More upbeat assessments contend that AI will augment workers \u2013 perhaps the least-skilled ones \u2013 rather than replace them. Others argue that replacing workers is harder than it seems because jobs are collections of tasks and AI may not be able to do all of them seamlessly.\n\nSuch arguments are important and rooted in the microeconomics of work. However, macroeconomics offers the most persuasive arguments against mass unemployment in the face of AI.\n\nWhat is routinely overlooked is that technology is an inherently deflationary force. When it is broadly impactful, technology drives down costs and prices, pushing up consumers\u2019 real incomes and demand for new goods and services \u2013 and thus, new employment. A matter of logic more than luck, such rejuvenation of the labour market has occurred repeatedly.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful demonstration of technology\u2019s deflationary benefits has occurred with food. In the late 19th century, nearly half of all Americans worked on a farm and spent more than 40% of their disposable income on food. Over the subsequent 150 years, successive waves of innovation have left but roughly 1% of Americans working on farms. Food budgets, meanwhile, have fallen to roughly 12% of income.\n\nUS farm and non-farm employment and share of budget spent on food over the long run. Image: BCG\n\nLower prices deliver what economists call real income gains \u2013 consumers spend less and use the extra room in their budgets to increase consumption of, often new, goods and services, ultimately leading to new employment. Yes, the process has always come with sector-specific job losses and thus microeconomic pain but it has also served as a reliable route to new jobs and macroeconomic gain.\n\nWith such a record of failure, it may seem surprising that doomsayers cling to dystopian narratives of technological unemployment. But it is easier to spot technology-driven job losses, which are often concentrated and can happen fast than it is to discern new job creation, which is usually dispersed and happens over time.\n\n\u201c When it is broadly impactful, technology drives down costs and prices, pushing up consumers\u2019 real incomes and demand for new goods and services \u2013 and thus, new employment. \u201d \u2014 Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, Global Chief Economist, Boston Consulting Group | Paul Swartz, Executive Director, Senior Economist, Boston Consulting Group\n\nWill AI buck the trend?\n\nIf we scrutinize AI\u2019s promise along each step of the well-trodden path from new technology to new employment, it seems unlikely that AI will end a history of labour market rejuvenation and adjustment.\n\nCost reduction. AI is likely to succeed at replacing labour, particularly in services where digital technologies have struggled to do so in the past. Though the speed and size of this impact are AI is likely to succeed at replacing labour, particularly in services where digital technologies have struggled to do so in the past. Though the speed and size of this impact are likely to be more modest than many expect today , gradual and cumulatively significant cost reduction (and productivity growth) is a safe bet.\n\nFalling prices. Unless labour-saving technology can be monopolized, it will continue to drive cost competition and deflation. Far from being specific to food production, the effect has been seen in manufactured goods and now looks set to unfold in services. Policymakers may need to watch for and ensure competitive market structures to ensure that AI becomes a deflationary force in the economy.\n\nNew demand. Real income gains often drive demand for goods and services that were barely known when a new technological wave began (few would have foreseen the arrival of social media marketers a few decades ago). This demand effect could fall short if consumers retreat and save their income gains. However, the resulting savings glut seems unlikely and directly contradicts the historical record.\n\nNew employment. What if a machine or an algorithm can always meet new demand? That humans lose all comparative advantage seems remarkably unlikely. AI\u2019s labour-enhancing properties are as credible as its labour-eliminating ones. But even if Leontief\u2019s words turned out prescient and humans went \u201cthe way of the horse,\u201d that would hardly amount to a macroeconomic dystopia. Instead, the overwhelming deflationary impulse would lay the ground for unparalleled prosperity.\n\nThe impact of AI will be seen, experienced, and reported primarily through a microeconomic lens that magnifies the disruptions and gyrations that will come. That should not be conflated with the macroeconomic promise that AI holds. Mass technological unemployment remains an ahistorical and unlikely proposition. AI does come with important risks but pervasive joblessness should not top our list of concerns.\n\nA far more likely outcome is a gradual increase in productivity and wealth, punctuated by the microeconomic pain of any economic transformation. The world will not be without work but it will work differently.\n\nLoading...",

From dominating IT careers to reshaping classrooms, AI has dramatically altered the landscape of daily life. Its rapid rise in an already competitive job market raises pressing concerns. Many workers fear this technological wave will wipe out their jobs. Yet, a large portion of the global workforce has successfully integrated AI as a powerful tool. Whether viewed as a partner or a disruptive force, one fact remains: AI is here to stay. In this uncertain future, adapting to AI is crucial to securing our place in the workforce.The future of the global workforce in the age of AI presents a blend of apprehension and opportunity. According to Korn Ferry's, more than half of employees under 44 years of age are skeptical about the impact of AI, fearing that it might replace their jobs in the coming years. This uncertainty highlights a growing need for upskilling, particularly in AI-related fields. Microsoft and LinkedIn\u2019sfurther reinforces this, revealing that 66% of business leaders are unlikely to hire candidates without AI skills, making proficiency in artificial intelligence a critical requirement in today's job market.However, not everyone shares this concern. Romal Shetty, CEO of Deloitte South Asia, offers a more optimistic outlook. As reported by PTI, Shetty believes that AI will not only create new roles but also generate more jobs than it will displace, particularly those related to repetitive tasks. He emphasizes that human intervention will remain essential to harness the full potential of AI, positioning it as a tool for empowerment rather than a threat.In summary, while AI's rise is causing concern for some, many experts believe that its transformative power will create more opportunities than it eliminates, provided the global workforce embraces continuous learning and adapts to new technologies.In this evolving job landscape, upskilling is paramount. The World Economic Forumhighlights that as AI transforms industries, companies are expanding their training programs to equip employees with new skills. While 42% of employees received training to address skill shortages in 2020, this figure saw a marginal decline to 41% by 2023. Nonetheless, businesses continue to view skill gaps as a major hurdle, identifying on-the-job learning as the most effective method to drive workforce development. Here are the top 5 skills you need to develop to stay afloat in the evolving job market.In the age of AI, soft skills have taken centre stage. While we have to accept the bitter truth that artificial intelligence performs better than humans in a lot of ways, but can never exhibit soft skills. Hence, to establish a niche for yourself you need to have a strong hold on soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Do not miss out to add these skills on your resume.Employers increasingly value emotional intelligence and the ability to collaborate effectively. Participate in group projects, volunteer opportunities, or public speaking workshops to hone these essential abilities.Having a robust LinkedIn network not only opens gateways of opportunities but also helps keep abreast of evolving market trends. Participate in industry conferences, webinars, and networking events to connect with like-minded individuals. Effectively utilize platforms like LinkedIn to engage with professionals in your field, share insights, and seek mentorship.Your professional candidature should mirror your skills, experiences and values. Utilise social media professional platforms to demonstrate your expertise and accomplishments.

Indeed's report examined soft skills like communication, leadership and organization, more technical skills including specific coding languages, and hands-on skills such as cooking and administering medication.\n\n\"We were able to take all these skills, map them to over a million job postings that we had over the last year or so, and then evaluate: Could gen AI replace a human being in performing this particular job function?\" says Svenja Gudell, Indeed's chief economist. \"When we did that, the result was actually quite striking because we found that there were really no skills \u2014 literally zero \u2014 that were very likely to be replaceable.\"\n\nIndeed used GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest multimodal generative AI model, to evaluate its own ability to perform work skills across three areas: provide theoretical knowledge related to skills, use those skills to solve problems and execute those skills either physically or digitally.\n\nThe model then used that assessment to rate the likelihood of whether generative AI could replace a person to carry out a given skill.\n\nThe research indicates that AI is only suited, for now, to serve a support role for workers: While AI has relatively high technical competency, without stronger problem-solving capability and hands-on functionality, it can't compete with human labor.\n\n\"Our takeaway was that gen AI, in its current form at least \u2014 now that's a pretty important caveat \u2014 would be a very advanced digital assistant, and it could certainly make us more productive in some settings,\" Gudell says. \"But it's not replacing the human quite yet.\"\n\nIndeed's researchers considered 16 occupations in their study and highlighted five jobs that involve the greatest share of skills that have the potential to be replaced by AI. Those lines of work are:\n\nAccounting professionals Marketing and advertising specialists Software developers Health care administrative support staff Insurance claims and inspection officers\n\nThe technical and often repetitive nature of the skills needed for those roles play into AI's strengths, says Gudell, in addition to the fact that those professions tend to require less physical interaction.\n\nOn the other hand, occupations that demand client or customer exchange, physical presence or less repetitive problem-solving are the least likely to be replaceable, she adds, citing patient-facing health care work such as nursing as examples.\n\nStill, workers shouldn't shy away from certain career paths that are more susceptible to being replaced by AI, according to Gudell. Instead, she explains, people interested in software development, for instance, should learn to use AI tools to increase their productivity and boost their competitiveness in the job market.\n\n\"It's really all about using these tools to your maximum advantage when you're searching for a job,\" Gudell says.\n\nWant to earn more money at work?

        "text": "By Aarul Malaviya, Founder, Zamit\n\nThe advent of AI has been causing a transformational shift across industries all over the world and this has had a direct impact on the employment market. On the one hand, AI automation leads to improvements in the organisation\u2019s efficiency and productivity, but on the other hand, it creates job disposability and thus requires constant skill upgrades and skill development. This evolution calls for employee and employer readiness to proactively respond to the changes to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nEmployment: A review of the current status\n\nNew jobs for machines and automation can create global economic displacement. In a World Economic Forum report, it is predicted that up to 85 million new jobs could be moved to automation and artificial intelligence technologies by 2025, and at the same time, new jobs well adapted to new roles of humans, machines, and algorithms will be created\u201497 million. This net gain points to the evolving nature of the labour market, where traditional functions get mechanised and new careers open up in the areas of IT.\n\nComplex and higher-skill demand jobs in technology, problem-solving, and creativity are on the rise. For instance, there is an increased demand for AI specialists, data analysts, and digital marketing professionals. In a study conducted by McKinsey Global Institute, it was estimated that up to 12 million workers may need to change their occupational category and learn new skills by the year 2030 because of automation. It has therefore become imperative that workers and employees continuously up-skill and re-skill to experience career growth.\n\nSkill enhancement, which involves acquiring new skills to stay competitive in one\u2019s current role, and skill development or training for transitioning into new roles, are essential strategies for success in today\u2019s evolving landscape. LinkedIn Learning revealed that 90 percent of companies are concerned about employee retention, and 4 in 5 people want to learn how to use AI in their profession When organisations invest in the growth and education of their workers, they can have a more adaptable workforce. Governments are also beginning to realise this need. The UK government, for instance, initiated the National Skills Fund, with \u00a32. 5 billion to assist adults to acquire new competencies and devise for technological transformation in the place of work.\n\nLifelong learning as a necessity\n\nWith the rapid pace of technological advancement, education is no longer confined to early life. Education is now a process that goes on throughout one\u2019s life. According to the OECD, improving literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills in working with the population will increase employment chances and improve their wages.\n\nThis is to the effect that the new media have facilitated continuous learning. There are online courses ranging from coding to data science that help learners acquaint themselves with new market trends.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAI\u2019s integration on an increasingly large scale necessitates continuous upskilling and reskilling to stay relevant in the ever-evolving world. This implies that individuals, businesses, and governments should work together in order to promote lifelong learning and the qualifications of the population to meet the demands, which are continuously evolving with the times. Education must evolve to not only future-proof individuals but also to empower them to thrive in an AI-driven world. Through a focus on digital skills, analytics, and AI governance, we can ensure a workforce that remains both relevant and resilient in the face of technological advancements.",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the world of work. Case studies show that AI applications, including the latest large-scale language models, can significantly increase productivity in professions such as customer service and management consulting. Swiss companies also seem to share this view. Investments in IT, communication and technology already account for 30 percent of all equipment investments by Swiss companies \u2013 more than during the dotcom bubble.\n\nTwo dimensions of AI\n\nIt is still unclear whether the productivity gains observed in the case studies can be transferred to other areas. The examples given may be limited to activities that are relatively easy for AI to take over. In order to make statements about other occupational groups, economists have now developed models that allow for a systematic analysis. Although no method can reliably predict the impact of AI and all its feedback effects on the world of work,, the models at least provide a snapshot of the far-reaching effects.\n\nIn the first step of our analysis, we identify the basic skills that are required to perform common jobs today. What does a call center agent need to know, what does a dentist need to know? In a second step, we can estimate the extent to which these skills sets are at risk of substitution or whether they are more likely to be complemented by AI applications.\n\nWe use this approach to measure the impact of AI applications on the occupations performed by the Swiss workforce. We distinguish between two dimensions, which are explained in more detail in the box at the end of the article:\n\nAffectedness: How strongly is a profession potentially affected by AI, i.e. how extensively are the skills required for it affected by AI? The higher the corresponding Exposure Score, the greater the proven impact of AI on the occupation in question. However, the indicator does not differentiate by the mode of action of the AI: it is not possible to say on the basis of this measure whether individual AI applications tend to replace or complement the skills of the professional. For such an assessment, the second dimension of complementarity must be used. Complementarity: Are the effects of AI likely to be substitutive or complementary, i.e. are workers in an occupation more likely to be supported by AI in the content of their work or to be in competition with it? The higher the complementarity score, the more likely it is that AI could have a supportive effect on the occupation.\n\nBenefiting, favored and less affected occupations\n\nBased on the exposure and complementarity scores, four \u201cAI quadrants\u201d can be formed in which the occupations \u2013 or occupational clusters \u2013 can be located:\n\nBenefiting occupations (1st quadrant): Judges and lawyers have above-average exposure and complementarity scores. AI applications increasingly cover the skills of the workforce, while at the same time the technology has a complementary effect due to the content of the work. Employees in this quadrant benefit from productivity gains.\n\n(1st quadrant): Judges and lawyers have above-average exposure and complementarity scores. AI applications increasingly cover the skills of the workforce, while at the same time the technology has a complementary effect due to the content of the work. Employees in this quadrant benefit from productivity gains. Favored occupations (2nd quadrant): Police officers have a below-average exposure score, so their skills are less affected by AI. At the same time, their complementarity score is above average, meaning that AI can have a positive impact on their work.\n\nLess affected occupations (3rd quadrant): Hairdressers are relatively unaffected by AI. They have below-average exposure and complementarity scores. As a result, they are not in direct competition with AI, but are also unable to use it to their own advantage.\n\n(3rd quadrant): Hairdressers are relatively unaffected by AI. They have below-average exposure and complementarity scores. As a result, they are not in direct competition with AI, but are also unable to use it to their own advantage. Vulnerable occupations (4th quadrant): Call center agents are more likely to be affected by AI applications in terms of their skills, but can only derive limited benefit from AI in their work. It is conceivable that AI will compete directly with employees in this group.\n\nThe figure shows that managers and teachers benefit from advances of AI just as much as natural scientists, social scientists and legal scholars. For employees with an academic background, however, the transition from a productivity-enhancing, complementary use of AI to a competitive relationship is fluid. Business economists and communications specialists, for example, are more likely to be among the group of professions at risk from AI. As a result, their work tends to consist of tasks that could be delegated to AI.\n\nThe groups of \u201cless exposed\u201d and \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d \u2013 and thus the group of professions with an exposure score below the median value \u2013 are very heterogeneous. They include electricians and security staff as well as engineers and academic healthcare professionals (pharmacists, doctors). This occupational group in particular has one of the highest complementarity scores, but is exactly average for all occupations in terms of exposure.\n\nLooking at other major occupational groups, it is noticeable that unskilled workers and low-skilled workers are likely to benefit comparatively little from the opportunities (and risks) of AI. The winners are managers (90% of whom are in the first quadrant), while on the other hand 80% of office workers are potentially at risk of from AI competition. In absolute terms, this means that a total of 490,000 office workers could find themselves in direct competition with AI. This is especially true for office workers without specialization. That is about 380,000 employees.\n\nAfter this tour d\u2019horizon, in the second part of the blog we will look at the influence of education, gender or age of a worker on whether AI acts as support or new competition. Finally, we turn to the role of the state in this aspect of structural change on the labor market.\n\nMethodology Measuring exposure\n\nTo measure exposure, we draw on the assessments of a group of US economists from Princeton University and New York University(Felten et al., 2021). The starting point of their work is the understanding that a certain set of skills is required to perform a job, i.e. a mix of cognitive, manual and social skills. The next step is to assess the extent to which AI applications are currently able to cover these skills. For example, it is determined whether AI applications in the field of image recognition can cover human skills for near and far distance vision. The sum of the assessed skills results in the job-specific exposure score. Measuring complementarity\n\nTo measure complementarity, the job-specific work context is taken into account (Pizzinelli et al., 2023). The work context refers to the physical and social conditions in which a profession is performed. These determine whether AI requires human supervision. If the AI needs to be supervised, it can only have a complementary effect. This will be the case, for example, if wrong decisions have major consequences that could endanger the health and safety of other people, or if the profession requires personal interaction. Even if such sensitive decisions are not (yet) fully delegated to AI, the technology can still support the human decision-maker, for example by providing additional information to avoid mistakes or by pointing out alternative decision-making options. If a profession is strongly characterized by these work contents, it is assumed that AI has a complementary rather than a substitutive effect on the profession.. Complementarity is largely independent of the extent to which the occupation is exposed to developments in AI technology. Felten et al. (2021) and Pizzinelli et al. (2023) use the O*NET database maintained by the US Department of Labor to determine their scores. This is often used in labor economics to measure the occupational content of jobs or tasks.\n\nPart 2: Flexibility Is Also the Trump Card in the Age of AI",

Its productivity enhancing potential is beyond doubt but the social impact of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) via labour market disruptions and labour displacement is barely understood. It also has the potential to skew the capital and labour shares of income in favour of the former,\u201d the Economic Survey said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe government\u2019s comments on AI impact on the labour market comes at a time when the Survey projects a need to generate an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 2030 (in the non-farm sector) to cater to the rising workforce.\n\nThe Survey argued that despite all its benefits, AI\u2019s impact on workers across all skill levels is uncertain, and this will create barriers for India to sustain high growth rates. \u201cOvercoming these requires a grand alliance of union and state governments and the private sector,\u201d it added.\n\nIn his note part of the Survey, the chief economic advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said that the corporate sector has a responsibility \u201cto think harder about ways AI will augment labour rather than displace workers.\u201d He noted that hiring in the IT sector has slowed significantly in the last two years, and \u201cdeploying capital-intensive and energy-intensive AI is probably one of the last things a growing, lower-middle-income economy needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor talent to be future-ready, they need to be adaptable and open to exploring diverse opportunities & upskilling. As the industry faces talent gaps in niche and specialized technologies, investing time and effort into developing unique skills can make talent more attractive to potential employers., Milind Shah, Managing director, Randstad Digital in India, said.\n\nMunira Loliwala, VP, Strategy& Growth, TeamLease Digital, says that job roles will be redefined and not eradicated with the advent of AI and Gen AI. \u201cAI will be more of an augmenter of human capability. Job losses will be replaced by job displacements that require reskilling,\u201d she added.\n\nWithout laying down specific solutions, the Survey added that the job market must adapt while leveraging the tech towards collective welfare measures. It suggested employees and job seekers to develop skills such as analytical thinking, innovation, complex problem solving, technology design and programming, and resilience and adaptability.\n\n\u201cIt is how we use the technology- whether we use it for automation, surveillance and control or we use it for informed decision making, problem-solving and augmentation- that decides whether AI will facilitate the path of job creation or will be a hindrance to it,\u201d the Survey said .",

        "text": "PwC\u2019s 2024 Global Workforce Hopes and Fears survey shows that many young people aged 18 to 25 are ready to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) \u2013 with 70% saying Generative AI (GenAI) gives them opportunities to expand their capabilities.\n\nPwC\u2019s AI Jobs Barometer suggests AI skills boost productivity and value, leading to a 25% wage premium. To benefit, workers must develop the necessary skills as AI rapidly changes required competencies.\n\nSkills-first hiring \u2013 recruiting based on abilities rather than traditional measures such as degrees or work history \u2013 can help young people find jobs and prosper in the age of AI.\n\nFor the young, the future is still unwritten. This reality can bring both excitement and uncertainty.\n\nToday\u2019s young people are entering the world of work at a defining moment, just as AI begins to transform it. This prospect may give rise to conflicting emotions. On the one hand, they might feel excited that AI can help them work more quickly and efficiently while making their jobs more enjoyable. On the other, they may be concerned that AI is reshaping the job market as they start their careers.\n\nSo, how is AI transforming the workplace \u2013 and how are young people navigating this shift? Recent research from PwC helps to shed new light on these questions. And the resulting insights confirm that while AI radically changes the world of work, young people who learn to harness it can open up enormous opportunities.\n\nMoreover, young people appreciate the opportunities that AI brings to them and their careers, suggesting they can \u2013 and will \u2013 fully embrace its potential in the years to come.\n\nOpportunities and urgency\n\nLet\u2019s look at the opportunities AI presents. PwC\u2019s 2024 AI Jobs Barometer reveals that the sectors that are deploying AI the fastest \u2013 the likes of professional services, financial services, and technology \u2013 are achieving productivity growth five times faster than the sectors that are making less use of AI. In addition, workers who have AI skills can command up to a 25% wage premium.\n\nThe clear implication? AI is triggering a revolution in what workers can achieve and how valuable they can be to employers. Young people are ideally placed to take advantage of this opportunity and reap the benefits.\n\nHowever, to do this, young workers will need to acquire or demonstrate AI-relevant skills quickly.\n\nAccording to our AI Jobs Barometer, the skills employers seek are changing 25% faster in occupations that are more likely to involve AI. Equally tellingly, PwC\u2019s 27th Annual Global CEO Survey shows that 69% of CEOs across all industries believe AI will require most of their workforce to develop new skills. The race is on and young people must join it.\n\nThe good news is that they recognize the scale of change in the workplace and are ready and willing to adapt. In PwC\u2019s 2024 Global Workforce Hopes and Fears survey, most young people (nearly two-thirds) are optimistic about the changes underway. An overwhelming 70% feel GenAI brings opportunities to learn new skills and improve the quality of their work.\n\nAddressing concerns and retaining talent\n\nTrue, young employees are harbouring some apprehensions alongside the optimism.\n\nJust over half \u2013 55% \u2013 are worried about their job security. Organizations need to alleviate some of that worry by being transparent when implementing any major changes \u2013 particularly around AI \u2013 and engaging the broader workforce in that endeavour. Embedding citizen-led learning \u2013 where employees can experiment and feedback their experiences without any fear \u2013 can also help embed change successfully.\n\nWhat does all of this mean for employers? In our view, they should take note of these insights into the upcoming generation\u2019s attitudes and mindset and offer their young workers every opportunity to build the skills they\u2019ll need to harness AI.\n\nIndeed, 39% of the young workers in our Hopes and Fears survey say they\u2019re likely to leave their job in the next 12 months, with over half \u2013 54% \u2013 stating opportunities to learn new skills as a key factor in the decision to job-switch (compared with 28% of all workers surveyed).\n\nBy comparison, in the Great Resignation following the pandemic, only 19% of all workers said they were likely to move. This highlights the critical need to offer continuous learning initiatives to retain young workers and help them build the skills to succeed in an AI age.\n\nThe overarching message is that employers must work hard to retain a young generation by giving them the opportunities they\u2019re seeking in this dawning age of AI. The only question is how best to do this.\n\nLoading...\n\nEmbracing skills-first hiring\n\nOne method that\u2019s seeing success within PwC \u2013 and for many of our clients \u2013 is a skills-first approach to recruitment, where people are hired based on their abilities rather than their formal qualifications or work history. We have provided analysis to support the World Economic Forum in its report, Putting Skills First: Opportunities for Building Efficient and Equitable Labour Markets.\n\nA skills-first approach can bring much greater agility to hiring\u2014just what\u2019s needed as AI rapidly disrupts the skills that jobs require. Skills-first hiring can also open the doors of high-value, highly productive employment to talented young people who have not had the time to build up work experience over many years.\n\nOverall, the results paint a picture of a young workforce that is eager to upskill and embrace new technologies and can see positive benefits ahead.\n\nWhile there\u2019s certainly speculation around the possible effects of AI on the world of work, not least for younger workers, our findings suggest that they may be lucky to be starting their careers as AI accelerates \u2013 and that young people know it. Employers and society must help them embrace the opportunity; skills-first hiring is a great place to start.",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence has burst onto the business world, transforming industries and workplaces around the globe. While it promises to boost efficiency and spark innovation, many worry about its impact on jobs. As AI continues to advance, a big question looms: Will it be a driving force for human progress, or will it lead to widespread unemployment?\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a double-edged sword. While it promises to revolutionise industries and improve our lives, it also carries the potential to disrupt the job market. As the world grapples with the rapid advancements in AI, India finds itself at a unique crossroads.\n\nOn one hand, the global shortage of chips for AI production presents a temporary setback for the country. However, this shortage also offers an opportunity for India to invest in domestic manufacturing and develop a skilled workforce. To capitalize on this potential, massive investments in infrastructure, research, and development are essential.\n\nA recent MIT study challenges the widespread belief that AI will inevitably steal jobs. Rather than focusing solely on which tasks can be automated, the researchers examined the economic viability of AI implementation. By considering factors like AI development costs and the irreplaceable contributions of human workers, the study offers a more balanced view. While AI will undeniably reshape the job market, the findings suggest a less drastic overhaul than many anticipate.\n\nA recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report, \"AI at Work: Friend and Foe,\" highlights the complex relationship between artificial intelligence and the workforce. While optimism about AI's potential to boost productivity is surging, concerns about job security are also on the rise. The study, based on a global survey of over 13,000 employees, reveals a stark shift in sentiment. In just one year, the percentage of employees confident in AI and generative AI's positive impact on work jumped from 26% to 42%. However, this growing enthusiasm is tempered by a 5% increase in anxiety about job displacement caused by these technologies.\n\nThe World Economic Forum forecast that AI could displace 85 million jobs by 2025, but also create around 97 million new roles, particularly in areas requiring complex problem-solving and creativity. This indicates that while some jobs may vanish, new opportunities will likely emerge, better aligned with the changing demands of the workforce.\n\nIndeed's AI at Work Report reveals that while most jobs may be impacted by generative AI (GenAI), full replacement of human workers is unlikely. Only 19.8% of roles, particularly in knowledge-based fields like software development, face high exposure to AI-driven changes. In contrast, jobs requiring manual skills and personal interaction, like nursing or driving, remain less vulnerable to automation.\n\nMeanwhile, AI is already generating employment opportunities. IBM recently drew attention with its plan to create up to 800 new high-value tech jobs in Ireland. IDA Ireland reported that this represents the largest multinational job creation initiative in the country this year. The new positions will centre on developing advanced AI-powered software and will include roles in research and development, digital sales, and consulting.\n\nThe BCG report showed a disparity in job security perceptions between early adopters and laggards of generative AI. 49% of regular GenAI users express fear of job displacement within the next decade, a figure that contrasts with the 24% of non-users sharing this apprehension. This underscores the need for organisations to implement strategies to address employee concerns and capitalize on AI's potential while mitigating risks.\n\nA staggering 64% of organisational leaders are actively integrating GenAI tools to drive transformation, according to the BCG report. This trend is particularly pronounced at the frontline, where GenAI usage has doubled since 2023, with 43% of frontline workers now leveraging these tools for their daily tasks.\n\nOne of the most tangible benefits of GenAI adoption is increased productivity. The BCG report reveals that a substantial 58% of GenAI users report saving at least five hours per week. This newfound time is being strategically allocated to tackle additional responsibilities, explore innovative solutions, delve deeper into GenAI capabilities, and focus on high-level strategic initiatives.\n\nDespite the productivity gains offered by GenAI, a significant gap in employee training is hindering its full potential. While leaders are more likely to have received training on AI's impact (50%), a mere 30% of managers and 28% of frontline employees have had similar opportunities.\n\nThe report underscores a striking geographical divide in GenAI adoption and sentiment. Emerging markets in the Global South, including Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa, and the Middle East, demonstrate a more optimistic and proactive stance towards AI compared to their counterparts in established economies. These regions boast higher rates of GenAI adoption across all organizational levels and a greater likelihood of employees receiving AI training. This suggests a potential opportunity for the Global South to leapfrog traditional economic powers in AI-driven innovation and development.\n\nTo fully harness the potential of GenAI, BCG recommends a strategic five-pronged approach. Organizations must prioritize a transformation-centric mindset, effectively manage change across the board, invest in large-scale employee training, emphasize value creation and employee well-being, and proactively anticipate future challenges.\n\nAccording to the Work, Workforce, Workers Age of Generative AI Report by Accenture, 95% of workers acknowledge the value of generative AI in their roles. However, significant concerns remain about how organisations will handle the technology\u2019s implementation.\n\nThe report reveals that 60% of employees worry that generative AI could lead to increased stress and burnout, while 58% feel uncertain about their job security. Additionally, 57% seek greater clarity on how generative AI will impact their careers. These findings underscore a critical need for organisations to address trust and transparency as they integrate generative AI into the workplace.\n\nThe journey towards an AI-powered future is complex and multifaceted. While challenges such as job security and the need for upskilling persist, the potential benefits of AI are undeniable. By embracing a strategic approach, organizations can harness the power of AI to drive innovation, enhance productivity, and create new opportunities for their workforce. As AI continues to evolve, it is imperative for businesses, governments, and individuals to work collaboratively to shape a future where humans and machines coexist harmoniously.\n\nSkills in demand in the age of AI\n\nAs AI automates routine tasks, its real value lies in enhancing human capabilities. Today's workforce needs to master the intersection of human creativity and machine intelligence.\n\nData Literacy: With AI's growing reliance on data, the ability to analyse and extract insights from large datasets is crucial. Data scientists lead this charge, but a basic understanding of data is now essential across all professions to effectively interact with AI systems.\n\nUnderstanding AI Principles: Knowledge of machine learning and its principles is increasingly valuable. Professionals who grasp AI algorithms, their limitations, and ethical considerations will be highly sought after.\n\nCreativity: While AI excels at pattern recognition, it struggles with innovation. Humans excel in abstract thinking and generating novel ideas, a skill that remains crucial.\n\nCritical Thinking: AI lacks the ability to question assumptions or challenge norms. Human critical thinking is necessary to ensure AI is used to augment, not replace, human judgment.\n\nAdaptability: The rapid pace of technological change demands continuous learning. Those who can swiftly adapt and acquire new skills will thrive in the evolving job landscape.\n\nEthical Awareness: As AI becomes more embedded in society, issues of bias, privacy, and accountability will be paramount. A workforce that prioritises ethical considerations will ensure responsible AI development and deployment.\n\nRoadmap to prepare for the future of work\n\nWhile it's a period of uncertainty for many, it's also an era of unprecedented opportunity. To navigate this transformation successfully, individuals must adopt a proactive approach to skill development and career trajectory.\n\nPrioritise Lifelong Learning: The pace of technological advancement is relentless. To remain competitive, individuals must cultivate a growth mindset and embrace continuous learning. Online platforms, university extensions, and industry-specific certifications offer a plethora of opportunities to acquire new skills and knowledge.\n\nDevelop a Strong Foundation in Digital Literacy: Proficiency in digital tools and platforms is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Basic computer skills, data analysis, and an understanding of AI and machine learning are essential for navigating the modern workplace.\n\nCultivate Human-Centric Skills: While AI excels at tasks involving data processing and pattern recognition, it struggles with empathy, creativity, and critical thinking. Investing in these uniquely human qualities will be invaluable. Strong communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills will be increasingly sought after.\n\nBuild a Strong Personal Brand: In the age of digital networks, personal branding is crucial. Develop a compelling online presence that showcases your skills, expertise, and professional identity. Utilize platforms like LinkedIn to connect with industry peers and potential employers.\n\nEmbrace Adaptability and Resilience: The future of work is characterized by uncertainty. Developing the ability to adapt to change, embrace new challenges, and bounce back from setbacks is essential. Cultivating resilience will help individuals navigate career transitions and explore new opportunities.\n\nNetwork Strategically: Building and maintaining strong professional relationships is indispensable. Attend industry conferences, join professional associations, and participate in online forums to expand your network.\n\nFocus on High-Value Skills: While automation may eliminate routine tasks, it creates demand for roles that require higher-level cognitive abilities. Develop skills in areas such as strategic thinking, innovation, and leadership to position yourself for in-demand roles.\n\nInvest in Your Emotional Intelligence: The ability to understand and manage emotions, both your own and others', is becoming increasingly important. Emotional intelligence is crucial for building strong relationships, resolving conflicts, and leading teams.\n\nBy proactively addressing these areas, individuals can enhance their employability, increase their earning potential, and thrive in the evolving world of work. Remember, the future of work is not solely about acquiring new skills but also about leveraging existing strengths in a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThe intersection of human potential and artificial intelligence heralds a new era of possibilities. While the spectre of job displacement casts a long shadow, it is equally essential to recognise AI's capacity to augment human capabilities and drive innovation. The future belongs to those who can navigate this complex landscape with agility, adaptability, and a focus on developing uniquely human skills.\n\nThe success of the AI revolution hinges on our ability to harness its potential while mitigating its risks. A balanced approach that prioritizes human well-being and ethical considerations is imperative. As we journey into this uncharted territory, it is crucial to remember that AI is a tool, and its impact will be shaped by the choices we make.",

In January, she penned a blog post where she predicted that AI \"will affect almost 40% of jobs around the world.\"\n\n\"Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring,\" Georgieva wrote.\n\n\"In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear,\" she continued.\n\nRepresentatives for IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI sent outside regular business hours.\n\nGeorgieva's warnings appear to be prescient, considering the new offerings that have been served up by AI upstarts like OpenAI this week.\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI announced its latest flagship AI model, GPT-4o. The model, which will be made free to all users, \"can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time,\" making it suitable for tasks like teaching and translation.\n\nDemos of the software have taken the internet by storm, reigniting concerns that AI could decimate the job market as we know it.\n\nEven OpenAI's cofounder and CEO, Sam Altman, has regularly warned people of AI's potential impact on the job market. On May 7, Altman told attendees at a Brookings Institution panel that people were underestimating AI's impact on the economy.\n\n\"GPT- 4 didn't have this huge detectable impact on the economy, and so people were kind of like, 'Oh well, we were too worried about that, and that's not a problem,'\" Altman said, referencing the AI model that OpenAI released last year.\n\n\"I have a fear that we just won't take that one seriously enough going forward, and it's a massive, massive issue,\" he continued.\n\nThat said, some experts do believe that the AI's rise will provide job seekers with different opportunities as well.\n\nIn November, LinkedIn vice president Annesh Raman said in a podcast interview that while AI will reduce the value of technical skills, it will also make soft skills more important.\n\n\"In the 1980s, when Microsoft released Excel, people were petrified and said it would put all of these accountants out of a job. We've got more accountants now than in the 1980s,\" Simon Lucey, the director of the University of Adelaide's Australian Institute for Machine Learning, told BI on Tuesday.",

        "text": "Or are the darker predictions that AI will make us redundant, leading to widespread unemployment and social unrest closer to reality? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nSo following on from this piece on \u201c AI washing \u201d, here I\u2019m going to look at what the real impact of AI is going to be on jobs. Are we on the cusp of an era where robots and super-smart software will take on all the mundane, difficult and dirty jobs we don\u2019t want to do, leaving us free to live lives of leisure and relaxation?\n\nThis means it\u2019s important to be able to distinguish between realistic projections and marketing buzz.\n\nThis isn\u2019t surprising given the amount of money on the table \u2013 AI is forecast to add up to $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030, and no one wants to miss out on their slice of the pie.\n\nIt\u2019s clear to me that AI is going to have a hugely transformative impact on the way we live, work and play. But it\u2019s also clear that there\u2019s a huge amount of hype, misunderstanding and misinformation around the subject.\n\nAutomation Or Augmentation?\n\nExperts predict that the impact of AI and automation on the job market will be significant \u2013 according to the WEF, 85 million jobs will be displaced. However, it also believes that 97 million new jobs will be created by the AI revolution.\n\nThe impact of AI on jobs will take two forms \u2013 automation and augmentation.\n\nSimple, routine tasks such as data entry or solving basic customer service inquiries will largely be automated. McKinsey predicts that up to 45 percent of work activities can be automated in this way.\n\nWhen it comes to more complex tasks, the role of AI will be to augment human skills. For example, it will help healthcare professionals to analyze medical images and patient data, and lawyers will use it to quickly summarize documents and identify relevant information and arguments.\n\nUnderstanding this balance between automation and augmentation is crucial to understanding the impact that AI will have on jobs in the future. Getting it right will lead to more efficient workflows, reducing the time that humans need to spend on manual, repetitive tasks and freeing them up to spend more time being creative and solving complex problems.\n\nInevitably this will lead to changes in the workforce, as people with the ability to work alongside machines, or carry out tasks that machines still can\u2019t do, become increasingly valuable.\n\nThis means that those in roles that are reliant on human ingenuity are less likely to find themselves being replaced by machines.\n\nMore manual, repetitive jobs, however, are clearly at greater risk. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all doom and gloom.\n\nWhile warehouse workers may find themselves threatened with replacement by robots, opportunities will emerge for people capable of taking up strategic planning roles in logistics. And entry-level customer service workers facing redundancy due to chatbots will have the chance to take up more specialized roles, handling complex or sensitive customer problems.\n\nAI will still have a part to play in the day-to-day operations of both of these new jobs, but its role will be to augment rather than automate and replace.\n\nTwo Potential Futures\n\nIn the introduction I mentioned two projections \u2013 one optimistic and one pessimistic \u2013 of the way AI\u2019s effect on jobs could impact society.\n\nIn one possible future, AI takes over all of the mundane, menial and boring chores, leaving humans free to engage in creative, fulfilling and ultimately rewarding elements of their work. This leads to a society where we are all happier, more productive and more prosperous.\n\nIn the other, those whose roles are displaced by AI find it difficult to transition into the more rewarding roles, ultimately becoming unemployed or under-employed. This could exacerbate existing inequalities, strain social support systems and disrupt society in many unpleasant ways.\n\nIn reality, the outcome will likely fall between these two extremes.\n\nIf companies take the social implications of widespread automation into account, rather than simply focusing on potential efficiency gains, it\u2019s more likely that harmful effects will be mitigated.\n\nThis will involve assessing the likely impact of AI and automation on workforces, and putting measures in place to help workers transition into the more highly-skilled, human-focused roles that will be needed.\n\nInitiating programs for retraining and reskilling will be an important part of this.\n\nAnd governments will have a role to play in this, too, with a responsibility to create legislation and frameworks that will support workers during the transition to an AI-powered economy.\n\nPreparing For The Future Of Work\n\nOf course, as individuals, we also have to take responsibility for shaping the way AI will impact our jobs and, ultimately, our lives.\n\nThis means proactively preparing for the changes that lie ahead. Developing our human, \u201csoft\u201d skills \u2013 problem solving, creative thinking, communication and so on \u2013 will make us more ready to transition into future-proof roles that will inevitably emerge.\n\nContinuous, life-long learning will become increasingly important, too, meaning we are more likely to be able to adapt in sync with a shifting workplace landscape. If employers aren\u2019t willing to help with this, we can take advantage of online courses, tutorials and certifications to broaden our knowledge and expertise.\n\nBuilding adaptability and resilience to change will be vital in navigating the future of work.\n\nOverall, the rise of AI and its inevitable impact on the job market brings undeniably worrying challenges but also exciting opportunities. The actions taken by businesses, governments and individuals today will determine the true impact of automation on jobs and indeed, its wider impact on society. By striving for continuous improvement we can increase our chances of achieving a happy and rewarding outcome.",

        "text": "Automation fears have long haunted the future of work. Generative AI is now the latest technology to inspire fear and optimism.\n\nAI will augment jobs in the future. But the argument could be made that job augmentation for some means job replacement for others. For example, if a worker's job is made 10 times easier, the positions created to support that job might become unnecessary.\n\nA June 2023 McKinsey report stated that generative AI (GenAI) would automate 60% to 70% of employee workloads.\n\nAI is already replacing jobs, responsible for nearly 4,000 cuts made in May 2023, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. OpenAI -- the company that created ChatGPT -- estimated 80% of the U.S. workforce would have at least 10% of their jobs affected by large language models (LLMs).\n\nOther ways AI could affect jobs Job replacement isn't the only effect AI could have on work. The positive angle is human-machine cooperation. AI will help people improve their work experience by automating rote, repetitive tasks. The technology will maximize the \"goods\" of work while minimizing the \"bads.\" This may contribute to a surge in AI jobs and increased demand for AI skills. AI needs a lot of human feedback. For example, LLMs train using a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback where people fine tune models by repeatedly ranking outputs from best to worst. A May 2023 paper also describes the phenomenon of model collapse, which states that LLMs malfunction without a connection to human-produced data sets. There's also a another angle -- that workers will collaborate with AI, but it will stunt their productivity. For example, a generative AI chatbot might create an overabundance of low-quality content. Editors would then need to write additional content to flesh out the articles, pushing the search for unique sources of information lower on their list of priorities.\n\nJobs most affected by AI Writing is just one example of a job being automated by the latest AI systems, but there are many job types that could be affected in various ways, including the following: 1. Administrative GenAI tools can help office administrators and assistants with tasks such as basic email correspondence, identifying data trends, finding mutually available meeting times across time zones and other summary/synthesis exercises. For example, Microsoft 365 Copilot -- a collection of AI-powered tools integrated into Microsoft's productivity suite -- could radically increase office workers' productivity. 2. Content writers Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini can generate text that aims to convince readers that a human wrote it. This has implications for content writers, especially in fields that require less nuance, originality or factual accuracy. Original or specialized writing might become increasingly valuable as generic, AI-generated writing proliferates on the internet, obscuring genuine human perspectives. These tools can aid content writers in developing ideas, fixing grammar or syntax and doing high-level research. 3. Coding Programs such as ChatGPT can write fluent, syntactically correct code faster than most humans, so coders who are primarily valued for producing high volumes of low-quality code quickly might be concerned. Coders who produce a quality product might have nothing to fear, however, and use AI to improve their workflow instead. 4. Customer service The customer service sector offers many opportunities for automation. AI-powered chatbots can provide speedy, personalized responses to customer questions, reducing the need for human workers. There are many examples of AI in customer service pre-ChatGPT, including the following: Robotic process automation.\n\nCustomer self-service.\n\nChatbots.\n\nSentiment analysis. It's likely customer service departments will continue to integrate the newest AI technologies. Currently, ChatGPT can't automate an entire contact center, but there are many ways it could lighten the workload, such as translating or summarizing customer inquiries. 5. Drivers The prevalence of AI in vehicles has the potential to affect car and truck driving jobs. Rideshare companies are partnering with self-driving car providers to minimize the need for human drivers and give riders the option to ride in an autonomous vehicle. The trucking industry uses AI for driver assistance and accident prevention systems, route planning, predictive maintenance and more advanced driver training systems. AI is changing the role of the truck driver and their daily responsibilities. This has the potential to create new efficiencies in the space. It also might create new challenges as workers adapt to the technology. 6. Legal There is significant evidence indicating AI will affect legal jobs. AI will eventually perform many of the tasks paralegals and legal assistants typically handle, according to one study by authors from Princeton University, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania. A March 2023 study from Goldman Sachs said AI could perform 44% of the tasks that U.S. and European legal assistants typically handle. GPT-4, OpenAI's latest and greatest language model, passed the Uniform Bar Examination in the 90th percentile. AI could help automate routine law tasks such as the following: Document review.\n\nContract analysis.\n\nLegal research.\n\nSearches for relevant case law. 7. Marketing AI can automate several marketing-related tasks such as personalized content creation, customer segmentation, social media management and data analysis. Generative AI tools can help marketers create marketing content, personalize sales emails and score leads at a faster rate than humans can. AI can also help SEO marketers optimize content with meta descriptions and title tags, and solidify a consistent brand voice across marketing materials. One example of a generative AI-powered marketing campaign was the #NotJustACadburyAd campaign, which used the digital likeness of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan to create thousands of hyper-personalized ads for small local businesses. The campaign used a microsite that enabled small-business owners to create their own version of the ad featuring the Bollywood star. 8. Manufacturing In manufacturing, AI has long played a critical role in automating repetitive, rote physical tasks. By using AI and robots to automate assembly line tasks such as product assembly, welding and packaging, manufacturers can benefit. Computer vision systems in manufacturing can identify flaws in the product using machine learning and sensor data. AI systems integrated with robots have the potential to increase precision, productivity and quality, reducing downtime on the assembly line and in manufacturing more broadly. AI is also changing the nature of work in warehouses. Amazon fulfillment centers use autonomous mobile robots to help workers on the warehouse floor with retrieving and consolidating inventory. 9. Teachers Teachers could be affected by AI in several ways. The immediate concern is that they will have a harder time detecting plagiarism or students cheating on assignments. But AI could help teachers by doing the following: Acting as productivity tools.\n\nDrafting lesson plans.\n\nGenerating quiz questions and mock tests. Teacher sentiments range from being worried about the technology replacing them to insisting that the in-person classroom connection is essential to education. Some people draw an analogy between ChatGPT and when students weren't allowed to use calculators in the classroom. Now, most people have a calculator app on their smartphone. There might also be a time when it becomes accepted for students to use ChatGPT to aid with schoolwork. 10. Travel and tourism AI can help travelers discover new destinations and travel opportunities. AI assistants and chatbots let users book flights, rent vehicles and find accommodations online and offer a personalized booking experience. AI can also perform flight forecasting, which helps prospective travelers find the cheapest time to book a flight based on automated analysis of historical price patterns. Travel companies can also use AI to analyze the deluge of data that customers in their industry generate constantly. For example, travel companies can use AI to help aggregate and interpret customer feedback, reviews and polls to evaluate the company\u2019s performance and develop strategies for improvement. 11. Translators AI has the potential to affect the translation services industry. AI improves the capability of translation services, enabling automated, real-time translation in multiple languages. Translation requires a certain level of nuance, as translators need to be able interpret body language and emotions of the speaker or in the text they are translating. Translation jobs that require less nuance -- such as entry level jobs involving literal text translation -- are more likely to implement AI successfully. 12. Finance AI is also making an impact on finance and banking. GenAI could be used to monitor transactions and give detailed financial advice on how to save and spend efficiently. For example, Morgan Stanley uses AI-powered chatbots to organize its database. AI has several use cases in banking. 13. Graphic designers Adobe Photoshop's new Generative Fill feature is one example of the way generative AI can augment the graphic design profession. The feature lets people with no photo editing experience make photorealistic edits using a text prompt. Other tools -- such as Dall-E and Midjourney -- also create realistic looking images and detailed artistic renderings from a text prompt. 14. Engineering Generative design uses AI to expedite the computer-aided design process. Generative design helps with ideation, generating all computationally possible solutions to a problem within a given set of parameters -- even when the design is completely novel and a radical change from anything that has come before. Even though generative design affects the field of mechanical design, it is unlikely to replace human engineers. 15. Human resources The hype around AI and the fear of job losses has created a difficult dynamic for HR departments to manage in the interim. \"[Generative AI] will infiltrate every aspect of HR,\" said Patrick Thibodeau, a senior news writer at TechTarget, in a podcast. However, AI-powered recruiting tools could be used to do the following: Source qualified candidates.\n\nReview resumes.\n\nAutomate recruiter tasks. AI in recruiting has its positives and negatives. AI chatbots could also be used internally to help employees access their benefits and perform other self-service tasks. 16. Retail AI is affecting retail checkout and cashier positions as well, reducing the need for human employees. Automated self-checkout stations are becoming increasingly common. These systems can handle transactions independently, manage inventory and even collect data on customer behavior -- such as purchase frequency and average basket weight. Automated self-checkout systems can also help to detect fraudulent activity. In Amazon stores, AI-powered retail systems can automatically start a customer\u2019s shopping session by using turnstiles to identify the customer and match their physical presence in the store to their online profile and digital wallet. Other stores use computer vision to automatically add a product to the customer\u2019s virtual shopping cart when they remove the product from the shelf. 17. Supply chain AI can provide transparency into increasingly complex and expansive supply chains for manufacturers. AI-powered supply chain management tools can track supplies as they make their way through the various links and partners in the supply chain. AI in supply chain management has the potential to improve demand forecasting, inventory evaluation, customer communication, operational performance and even sustainability. Despite, generative AI\u2019s positive effect in this field, it also comes with risk in the form AI hallucinations, which can potentially introduce inaccurate or useless information.",

        "text": "Fears about AI\u2019s impact on employment are growing globally. As with any major technological shift, excitement and anxiety sit on opposite ends of the scale. Right now, fear seems to have the upper hand.\n\nMore people worry about AI taking their jobs than those who feel confident about adapting to the changes it brings.\n\nA recent Ipsos study found that 65% of respondents across 31 countries and regions fear that AI will lead to significant job losses in their nation \u2013 up from 64% last year. This concern is particularly pronounced in Southeast Asia, where AI-driven displacement feels like an impending reality.\n\nIn Malaysia, 73% of workers expressed anxiety about AI replacing jobs \u2013 well above the global average.\n\nHowever, in Indonesia (85%) and the Philippines (81%), the worry runs even deeper, as workers brace for automation\u2019s growing influence.\n\nEven in technologically advanced Singapore, 67% of respondents fear that AI could lead to widespread job losses. These figures underscore the region\u2019s growing unease as AI adoption accelerates, reshaping industries and traditional job structures.\n\nThe tension between job loss and job creation\n\nWhile AI has the potential to create new jobs, optimism is in short supply. The Ipsos survey reveals that only 43% of respondents globally believe AI will generate more employment \u2013 highlighting a stark gap between expectations of job loss and job creation.\n\nChina stands as an outlier, where 77% of respondents believe AI will lead to more jobs rather than displace workers. This contrast suggests that a nation\u2019s economic policies, workforce adaptability, and AI-driven investments significantly shape public perception.\n\nMeanwhile, in Malaysia and other Southeast Asian nations, scepticism reflects concerns over whether workers are truly ready to transition into new roles.\n\nDespite Malaysia\u2019s efforts \u2013 such as the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint, which aims to enhance digital capabilities \u2013 bridging the skills gap remains a challenge.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s recent Future of Jobs report adds to the concern, stating that 41% of companies globally plan to reduce their workforce by 2030 due to AI-driven automation. This reinforces the notion that businesses will need fewer human employees as AI advances.\n\nHowever, there is a silver lining: the same report highlights that 77% of companies plan to retrain or upskill their workforce to work alongside AI. This suggests that businesses recognise the need to balance automation with human employment.\n\nThe psychological impact of AI on workers\n\nBeyond the tangible risk of job displacement, AI anxiety is taking a toll on workers\u2019 mental wellbeing. The fear of redundancy fuels stress, insecurity, and a loss of professional identity.\n\nWork is more than just a livelihood \u2013 it\u2019s tied to a person\u2019s sense of purpose. The idea of being replaced by a machine can erode self-esteem and leave workers feeling powerless.\n\nThis anxiety is further amplified by media narratives, which often spotlight AI\u2019s potential to eliminate jobs rather than its ability to augment human capabilities.\n\nPsychologists have long studied the impact of job insecurity on motivation and engagement, showing that uncertainty about the future lowers productivity and job satisfaction.\n\nIf AI is seen as a force that undermines rather than enhances human work, resistance to technology adoption is likely to grow.\n\nTo counteract AI anxiety, experts emphasise the importance of adaptability. Workers should see AI as a tool for productivity rather than a direct competitor.\n\n\u201cAI can appear sinister at first glance \u2013 an otherworldly force poised to replace human expertise. Yet understanding and harnessing AI can open doors to innovation, efficiency, and personal growth. We might be surprised by how beneficial it can be to step closer,\u201d said Jonathan Gabay, a senior lecturer at Oxford College of Marketing in the UK.\n\nWhen we look closer at what frightens us, we often discover possibilities rather than perils \u2013 not just related to it \u2013 but the pearls within ourselves,\u201d Gabay said.\n\nCultivating skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving \u2013 areas where AI still struggles \u2013 can help employees stay resilient in an evolving job market.\n\nBusinesses, too, have a role to play. Providing AI training and ensuring employees feel empowered, rather than threatened, will be key to a smoother transition into an AI-driven future.\n\nYet, as they are setting up their employees for AI upskilling, employers can allay people\u2019s fears by being transparent about the changes taking place at work.\n\n\u201cAll this noise around AI leads to two specific questions in the minds of the confused employees: what happens to my job now, and how do I prepare for this new technology so that I am future-ready?\u201d said Anbu Ganapathi Muppidathi, president and CEO at Qualitest, which provides engineering solutions powered by AI.\n\nIf leaders don\u2019t answer these questions correctly, employees will migrate to places where they feel their jobs are safe or supported, otherwise known as attrition,\u201d Muppidathi said.\n\nCiting data from HR tech giant UKG \u2013 which found 54% of employees \u201chave no idea how their companies are using AI\u201d \u2013 Muppidathi warned against the spread of the wrong information on AI.\n\n\u201cWith this kind of misinformation or misunderstanding, employees will start to prepare for the perceived changes independently, and the distraction will show up in their current work outputs or productivity loss,\u201d he said.\n\n5 lessons for HR and business leaders on handling AI anxiety\n\n1. Proactive reskilling is a business imperative\n\nWith 41% of companies planning to downsize due to AI, waiting until jobs are lost to start retraining is too late. Businesses must invest in continuous learning programmes that equip employees with skills in AI collaboration, problem-solving, and creativity \u2013 areas where human expertise remains irreplaceable.\n\n2. AI adoption requires a people-first approach\n\nWorkers\u2019 fear of redundancy can lead to disengagement, lower morale, and resistance to AI adoption. HR leaders must focus on AI as an enabler, not a replacement, ensuring employees feel supported rather than sidelined. Transparent communication, clear career pathways, and AI upskilling initiatives will be crucial.\n\n3. Psychological safety matters as much as skills\n\nThe anxiety surrounding AI isn\u2019t just about technical skills \u2013 it\u2019s also about job security and professional identity. HR leaders should foster an environment where employees feel valued and empowered, with opportunities to redefine their roles alongside AI rather than be replaced by it.\n\n4. AI strategies must align with local workforce realities\n\nChina\u2019s optimism about AI job creation contrasts sharply with Southeast Asia\u2019s concerns. This underscores the need for AI strategies that reflect local economic policies, workforce readiness, and digital literacy levels. Businesses must tailor their AI integration plans to address the unique anxieties and strengths of their workforce.\n\n5. Business leaders must champion AI literacy\n\nMany AI fears stem from misconceptions rather than reality. Business leaders must take an active role in educating employees about AI\u2019s capabilities and limitations. Demystifying AI, offering hands-on training, and highlighting real-world examples of AI augmenting human work can shift the narrative from fear to opportunity.",

        "text": "An AI robot on display attracts visitors during the recent 2024 World Intelligence Expo in Tianjin. TONG YU/CHINA NEWS SERVICE\n\nWith the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, many people worry that their jobs \u2014 or even their very roles in society \u2014 could be replaced by AI and robots. But can AI or robots truly replace humans?\n\nThe idea of machines replacing humans has deep roots in history. Humans build machines to extend and enhance their own capabilities \u2014 from tools that can act as substitutes to human hands, to vehicles that do the job of feet, and much faster, to computers that augment human minds.\n\nYet machines possess many \"superpowers\" that humans lack. They're tireless, capable of working 24/7 while we sleep; they can process data at lightning speed, handle complex calculations effortlessly, don't have personal agendas; and work without getting sidetracked or taking breaks.\n\nEvery major technological advancement brings with itself a fresh wave of \"machine replacement\" anxiety, raising the fear that machines will outdo us at every turn. From the textile mills of the Industrial Revolution to today's intelligent systems, every era has raised the same fear.\n\nSo, will machines actually replace humans?\n\nFirst, it's true that machines have a replacement effect. Machines have surpassed human capability in many fields. In the production sector, the replacement of humans by machines hinges on a machine's ability to effectively perform a task.\n\nAutomated equipment freed up hands, industrial robots became \"super employees\" on assembly lines, and smart algorithms now make faster, more efficient decisions. Tasks once exclusive to humans are now partly or fully done by machines. This shift is happening across sectors. The jobs of factory workers, dispatchers, drivers, customer service providers are being taken over by automation because machines often match or exceed human efficiency.\n\nOn the consumer side, cashier-free stores and self-checkout services are replacing entry-level service jobs, ushering in a world of unmanned and smart services. But beyond replacement, machines are creating new job opportunities for humans. Rather than viewing machines only as competitors, we should recognize the new demands they create. In fact, each new machine requires skilled operators and maintenance workers, creating at least one job, even though part-time.\n\nDuring the industrial automation wave, new technical roles emerged, focusing on human-machine collaboration. When large AI models were introduced, some predicted that creative people risk losing their jobs, assuming that AI would replace human creativity. Yet creative people who embraced AI tools have become more innovative, demonstrating the creative potential that machines can unleash in humans.\n\nTo analyze whether machines can replace humans in many, if not all, jobs, it is necessary to make clear that machines replace skills, not people. For instance, during the early assembly line era, companies only needed workers to tighten screws on some products. When machines \"mastered\" the \"screw-tightening\" skill, the need for workers in that role declined. As machines evolve, they improve their precision in specific tasks. So once human skill levels stagnate, machines with higher accuracy can become the preferred choice.\n\nWhile automation may replace humans in jobs like \"screw-tightening\", it creates more jobs in the machine maintenance and operation sectors. Companies now require individuals with managerial and analytical skills to optimize production and workflow. Thus, machine replacement and creation effects are two sides of the same coin.\n\nA common joke goes something like this: \"Don't worry about being replaced by a machine \u2014 you're cheaper.\" It highlights the economic rationale behind automation. Replacement only makes sense when machines can reduce costs without compromising output. Machines don't need breaks or paychecks, which makes them attractive for labor-intensive industries. In such cases, for jobs that don't demand complex human capabilities, machines serve as low-cost alternatives to boost profits.\n\nBut this replacement effect has limits. Human labor retains unique, hard-to-replace qualities like creativity, emotional connection and complex judgment. These traits are essential in jobs requiring innovation, flexibility, management, or decision-making. The logic of \"machines replacing humans\" is not only about technical advancement but also about economic optimization, driven by cost-benefit analysis. It reshapes job markets, shifting human labor from easily replaceable roles to more valuable, innovative positions.\n\nFortunately, humans are more than just a collection of skills. Every individual has multifaceted qualities \u2014 hands that can work, minds that think \u2014 and can use experience productively and feel emotions. Embracing creativity, empathy, and intellectual curiosity is key to avoiding replacement. As long as we continue to develop our unique traits, machines will remain tools at our disposal, not our replacements. The real question is not whether machines will replace us, but rather, what can we uniquely achieve.\n\nThe author is a professor at the School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

        "text": "More than half of large firms surveyed say they plan to use AI in the next year to do the work previously done by humans.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nCorporate America is rapidly adopting artificial intelligence to automate work once exclusively done by humans.\n\nMore than half (61%) of large US firms plan to use AI within the next year to automate tasks previously done by employees, according to a survey of finance chiefs released Thursday.\n\nThose tasks include everything from paying suppliers and doing invoices to financial reporting, said the survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond.\n\nSee more\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to creative tasks for which some businesses are already relying on ChatGPT and other AI chatbots to assist, including crafting job posts, writing press releases and building marketing campaigns.\n\nThe findings show companies are increasingly turning to AI to cut costs, boost profits and make their workers more productive.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be running an innovative company without seriously considering these technologies. You run the risk of being left behind,\u201d Duke finance professor John Graham, academic director of the survey, told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nThe CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke and the Atlanta and Richmond Fed banks, found that nearly one in three (32%) firms \u2014 large or small \u2014 plan to use AI in the next year to complete tasks once done by humans.\n\nWhy bosses are deploying AI\n\nSome of this is already happening \u2014 especially among larger firms that have the financial firepower to experiment with AI.\n\nNearly 60% of all companies (and 84% of large companies) surveyed said that over the past year they have already leaned on software, equipment or technology including AI to automate tasks employees previously did. The survey was conducted between May 13 and June 3.\n\nBosses are turning to AI for a variety of reasons, including to trim what they are spending on human workers.\n\nThe CFO Survey found that companies say they are using automation to increase product quality (58% of firms); increase output (49%), reduce labor costs (47%) and substitute for workers (33%).\n\nStill, the good news for workers is that some experts don\u2019t believe AI will cause mass job loss, at least not right away.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a lot of job loss in the year,\u201d said Graham. \u201cIn the short run, this will be more about plugging some holes and possibly not hiring someone they would have otherwise \u2014 but not laying someone off. In part that\u2019s because this is all-brand new.\u201d\n\nSee more\n\nAI co-pilots on the way?\n\nYet workers will feel the impact of AI adoption, if they aren\u2019t already.\n\n\u201cThis could give humans more time to prioritize what is most important and rewarding,\u201d said Graham.\n\nReid Hoffman, the billionaire investor and co-founder of LinkedIn, told CNN that AI will likely disrupt some jobs but not in the immediate future.\n\n\u201cYears, not decades, but years, not months,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the timing of AI displacing humans. \u201cI believe in three to five years, we\u2019ll all have kind of an agent co-pilot that\u2019s helping us with anything from how we cook dinner\u2026to doing your job and writing and so forth.\u201d\n\nHoffman, who last year wrote a book called \u201cImpromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\u201d with the assistance from ChatGPT-4, stressed that for a number of years it will be a co-pilot, not a pilot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s job transformation. Human jobs will be replaced \u2014 but will be replaced by other humans using AI,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole ideas is to be the human who is using AI, to learn it, to do it, to make it happen.\u201d\n\nAI and inflation\n\nFor now, bosses and employees remain concerned about the cost of living and inflationary pressures.\n\nThe CFO Survey found that inflation is the No. 2 concern for the next year among US chief financial officers \u2013 behind only the related concern of interest rates and monetary policy.\n\nMost CFOs (57%) expect the price of their products to increase this year at a faster-than-normal pace.\n\nHowever, there was a divergence in the inflation outlook based on technological adoption. The survey found that companies that implemented automation over the past 12 months expect slower price hikes than those that hadn\u2019t.\n\nSee more\n\nGraham, the Duke professor, said that AI could eventually help moderate price increases but isn\u2019t optimistic it will be a major force to easing inflation right now.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it will be the cure in the next year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Significant risks\u2019\n\nThe CFO survey shows how fast companies are turning to AI \u2014 even as safeguards and regulatory frameworks are still being cobbled together.\n\nThe rapid adoption of AI in some industries like finance has concerned some.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a speech earlier this month that the use of AI by financial companies poses both \u201ctremendous opportunities and significant risks.\u201d\n\nA report issued last week by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, found that exiting regulation \u201cinsufficiently addresses\u201d how hedge funds are already using AI.\n\nThe report warned that there are \u201cno regulations or requirements\u201d mandating \u201cwhen and whether a human must be involved in decision making, including related to trading decisions.\u201d\n\nGraham, the Duke professor, said it would be wise for companies in all industries to have strong risk management systems and redundancies in place as they experiment with AI.\n\n\u201cThere has been rapid adoption of AI,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s being done with a grain of salt. There will be some situations where companies have embarrassing products or supply chain situations because they moved a little too fast.\u201d",

        "text": "At the World Economic Forum at Davos last week, many discussions focused on AI displacing the workforce. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) cannot replace the majority of jobs right now in cost-effective ways, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found in a study that sought to address fears about AI replacing humans in a swathe of industries.\n\nIn one of the first in-depth probes of the viability of AI displacing labour, researchers modelled the cost attractiveness of automating various tasks in the US, concentrating on jobs where computer vision was employed \u2013 for instance, teachers and property appraisers. They found only 23 per cent of workers, measured in terms of dollar wages, could be effectively supplanted. In other cases, because AI-assisted visual recognition is expensive to install and operate, humans did the job more economically.\n\nThe adoption of AI across industries accelerated in 2023 after OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and other generative tools showed the technology\u2019s potential. Tech firms from Microsoft and Alphabet in the United States to Baidu and Alibaba Group Holding in China rolled out new AI services and ramped up development plans \u2013 at a pace that some industry leaders cautioned was recklessly fast. Fears about AI\u2019s impact on jobs have long been a central concern.\n\n\u201c\u2018Machines will steal our jobs\u2019 is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models,\u201d the researchers from MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory said in the 45-page paper titled Beyond AI Exposure. \u201cWe find that only 23 per cent of worker compensation \u2018exposed\u2019 to AI computer vision would be cost-effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems.\u201d\n\nComputer vision is a field of AI that enables machines to derive meaningful information from digital images and other visual inputs, with its most ubiquitous applications showing up in object detection systems for autonomous driving or in helping categorise photos on smartphones.\n\nThe cost-benefit ratio of computer vision is most favourable in segments like retail, transportation and warehousing, all areas where Walmart and Amazon.com are prominent. It is also feasible in the health-care context, MIT\u2019s paper said. A more aggressive AI rollout, especially via AI-as-a-service subscription offerings, could scale up other uses and make them more viable, the authors said.\n\nThe study was funded by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and used online surveys to collect data on about 1,000 visually-assisted tasks across 800 occupations. Only 3 per cent of such tasks can be automated cost-effectively today, but that could rise to 40 per cent by 2030 if data costs fall and accuracy improves, the researchers said.\n\nThe sophistication of ChatGPT and rivals like Google\u2019s Bard has rekindled concern about AI plundering jobs, as the new chatbots show proficiency in tasks previously only humans were capable of performing. The International Monetary Fund said last week that almost 40 per cent of jobs globally would be impacted and that policymakers would need to carefully balance AI\u2019s potential with the negative fallout.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum at Davos last week, many discussions focused on AI displacing the workforce. The co-founder of Inflection AI and Google\u2019s DeepMind, Mr Mustafa Suleyman, said that AI systems are \u201cfundamentally labour-replacing tools.\u201d\n\nOne case study in the paper looked at a hypothetical bakery. Bakers visually inspect ingredients for quality control on a daily basis, but that comprises only 6 per cent of their duties, the researchers said. The saving in time and wages from implementing cameras and an AI system is still far from the cost of such a technological upgrade, they concluded.\n\n\u201cOur study examines the usage of computer vision across the economy, examining its applicability to each occupation across nearly every industry and sector,\u201d said Mr Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. \u201cWe show that there will be more automation in retail and health-care, and less in areas like construction, mining or real estate,\u201d he said via e-mail.

        "text": "A 68.7% majority of skills were \"very unlikely\" or \"unlikely\" to be replaced by AI, while 28.5% of skills may \"potentially\" be replaceable. Indeed's report examined soft skills like communication, leadership and organization, more technical skills including specific coding languages, and hands-on skills such as cooking and administering medication.\n\n\"We were able to take all these skills, map them to over a million job postings that we had over the last year or so, and then evaluate: Could gen AI replace a human being in performing this particular job function?\" says Svenja Gudell, Indeed's chief economist. \"When we did that, the result was actually quite striking because we found that there were really no skills \u2014 literally zero \u2014 that were very likely to be replaceable.\"\n\nIndeed used GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest multimodal generative AI model, to evaluate its own ability to perform work skills across three areas: provide theoretical knowledge related to skills, use those skills to solve problems and execute those skills either physically or digitally.\n\nThe model then used that assessment to rate the likelihood of whether generative AI could replace a person to carry out a given skill.\n\nThe research indicates that AI is only suited, for now, to serve a support role for workers: While AI has relatively high technical competency, without stronger problem-solving capability and hands-on functionality, it can't compete with human labor.\n\n\"Our takeaway was that gen AI, in its current form at least \u2014 now that's a pretty important caveat \u2014 would be a very advanced digital assistant, and it could certainly make us more productive in some settings,\" Gudell says. \"But it's not replacing the human quite yet.\"\n\nIndeed's researchers considered 16 occupations in their study and highlighted five jobs that involve the greatest share of skills that have the potential to be replaced by AI. Those lines of work are:\n\nAccounting professionals Marketing and advertising specialists Software developers Health care administrative support staff Insurance claims and inspection officers\n\nThe technical and often repetitive nature of the skills needed for those roles play into AI's strengths, says Gudell, in addition to the fact that those professions tend to require less physical interaction.\n\nOn the other hand, occupations that demand client or customer exchange, physical presence or less repetitive problem-solving are the least likely to be replaceable, she adds, citing patient-facing health care work such as nursing as examples.\n\nStill, workers shouldn't shy away from certain career paths that are more susceptible to being replaced by AI, according to Gudell. Instead, she explains, people interested in software development, for instance, should learn to use AI tools to increase their productivity and boost their competitiveness in the job market.\n\n\"It's really all about using these tools to your maximum advantage when you're searching for a job,\" Gudell says.\n\nWant to earn more money at work?

        "text": "This is a comprehensive list of statistics and trends related AI\u2019s impact on the job market, updated for 2024.\n\nAs AI tools become increasingly powerful and competent, more people are at risk of having their job fully automated.\n\nHowever, will AI really put most people\u2019s jobs at risk, or is the reality more nuanced?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore dozens of statistics covering the who, what, where, and when of AI replacing jobs \u2014 and creating new ones.\n\nInstantly Analyze\n\nAny Market Get My Free Report \ud83d\udc49\n\nKey Statistics About AI Replacing Jobs (Editor\u2019s Picks)\n\n300 million jobs could be lost to AI\n\n44% of companies using or planning on using AI believe it will result in layoffs in 2024\n\nBy the end of the decade, 14% of workers will have been forced by AI to change career\n\n14% of all workers have been displaced from their jobs by AI\n\n60% of the jobs in advanced economies are at risk of being replaced by AI\n\nBut just 26% of jobs in low-income countries are similarly exposed\n\n24% of all workers are worried that AI will soon make their job obsolete\n\nWorkers aged 18-24 are 129% more likely than workers aged over 65 to worry that AI will make their job obsolete\n\n15% of workers in the US would consider having an AI boss\n\nAI\u2019s Potential Impact on the Job Market\n\nAI may replace 300 million jobs (Goldman Sachs via BBC)\n\nThat represents 9.1% of all jobs worldwide. Potential job losses will not be evenly distributed across different sectors of the economy. Instead, they will likely be concentrated in the professions most vulnerable to being automated via generative AI tools (writing, photography, software development, etc.).\n\nBy 2025, two million workers in manufacturing could be replaced by automated tools (MIT / Boston University)\n\nMost of these automated tools are robots, not strictly AI, but some of these lost jobs will be replaced with new AI tools.\n\nBy 2030, 14% of employees will have been forced to change their career because of AI (McKinsey)\n\nThat\u2019s 14% of the global workforce, or 375 million workers.\n\nOne in four CEOs expect generative AI to lead to job cuts of 5% or more in 2024 (PwC)\n\nPwC surveyed 4,702 CEOs from 105 countries about the potential job losses resulting from generative AI tools. Only a minority of them believed that genAI would lead to significant job cuts, but that small figure could still represent tens of thousands of jobs across various organizations and countries.\n\n75% of CEOs think generative AI will significantly change their business within the next three years (PwC)\n\nA large majority of business leaders polled by PwC foresaw the need for training in new skills, improving cybersecurity protocols, and a host of other changes \u2014 all due to the introduction and adoption of generative AI.\n\n80% of the US workforce could have at least 10% of their tasks impacted by large language models (ARXIV)\n\nPractically every job involves some tasks that are vulnerable to being automated by AI. Only a small minority of workers are totally unexposed to AI.\n\nMore than 7.5 million data entry jobs will be lost by 2027 (WEF)\n\nThis represents the largest predicted loss of jobs of any profession. The professions that are predicted to lose the most jobs are those extremely vulnerable to AI. Data entry clerks was first, administrative secretaries was second, and accounting was third.\n\n44% of companies who use or plan to use AI think it will cause layoffs in 2024 (Resume Builder)\n\nHowever, just 21% of companies said AI would \u201cdefinitely\u201d cause layoffs in 2024. The other 23% were less certain.\n\n47% of US workers are at risk of losing their jobs to automation over the coming decade (CEPR)\n\nIn this case, automation also includes non-AI tools like robots.\n\nIt will take at least 20 years to automate just half of current worldwide work tasks (McKinsey)\n\nWhile the potential economic gains from automation are great, they are a difficult potential to fully realize. Various barriers prevent widespread adoption of automation tools; these barriers, which can be legal, political, economic, social, technological, or something else entirely, may take decades to overcome.\n\nAI\u2019s Current Impact On the Job Market\n\n23.5% of US companies have replaced workers with ChatGPT (Resume Builder)\n\nAccording to a Resume Builder survey of 1,000 US business leaders, 49% of companies have already adopted ChatGPT. Of those companies, 48% say the AI tool has replaced workers.\n\nWant to Uncover\n\nYour True Audience ? \ud83d\udd0e Get My Free Report \ud83d\udc49\n\nIn May 2023, 3,900 US job losses were directly linked to AI (SEO.ai)\n\nThose 3,900 jobs represented 5% of the total jobs lost that month. In turn, that made AI the seventh-largest eliminator of jobs in the US.\n\nSince 2000, automation has resulted in 1.7 million manufacturing jobs being lost (BuiltIn)\n\nThe introduction of automotive tools is also linked with increased competition, lower wages, and other negative effects beyond job loss.\n\n13.7% of US workers report having lost their job to a robot (Socius)\n\nAI has already displaced hundreds of thousands of workers. Additionally, people who were replaced by a robot gave a far higher estimate of the proportion of workers who have experienced the same when compared to workers who had not lost their job to a robot. Those who had been replaced estimated that 46.9% of US workers had experienced the same, while people who hadn\u2019t been replaced estimated that 29% of workers had been replaced. Both groups still wildly overestimated the true number of workers who had lost their job to a robot.\n\nWhich Careers Are Exposed to AI?\n\nTwo-thirds of all jobs in the US and Europe are exposed to automation (Goldman Sachs)\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean these jobs are all going to be fully automated. Exposure to automation just means that some of the tasks involved in a particular career can be automated.\n\n40% of jobs worldwide are exposed to AI (IMF)\n\nHundreds of millions of people still lack access to the internet. As technology continues to spread around the world, the proportion of workers exposed to AI \u2014 and therefore to being automated \u2014 may well increase.\n\n60% of jobs in advanced economies could be impacted by AI (IMF)\n\n\u201cImpacted\u201d is a deliberately neutral term. According to the IMF\u2019s report, about half of those impacted by AI will be benefited. The other half will be negatively impacted. For example, their wages might decrease, or they could outright lose their job.\n\n19% of workers are employed in the jobs most exposed to AI (Pew)\n\nTo calculate which jobs were most exposed to AI, researchers at Pew ranked professions based on how much workers relied on tasks that could be fully automated. The top 25% of jobs, when ranked this way, were considered \u201cmost exposed\u201d to AI.\n\n27% of workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher are employed in jobs most exposed to AI (Pew)\n\nWorkers with higher levels of educational attainment were more likely to be employed in professions considered most exposed to AI. Just 3% of workers with less than a high school degree worked in the jobs most exposed to AI. That figure rose to 12% for workers with a high school diploma, 19% for those with some college experience, and 27% for those with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nWorkers in jobs considered most exposed to AI earned $13.3/hr more than those in jobs least exposed to AI (Pew)\n\nBetter-paid jobs are currently more at risk of being lost to AI. While workers in the jobs most exposed to AI earned an average of $33.3 per hour, those employed in jobs least exposed to AI earned just $20 per hour on average.\n\nWidespread adaptation of current automation tech could affect half of the world economy (McKinsey)\n\nThat represents some 1.2 billion employees and $14.6 trillion in wages. For context, $14.6 trillion is larger than the GDP of all countries bar China and the US, and is more than three times larger than the third-largest GDP.\n\nAI Replacing Work Tasks\n\n34% of all business-related tasks are already performed by machines (WEF)\n\nThe remaining 66% of tasks are performed by humans. This represents a minor but significant decrease in the share of tasks being performed entirely by non-humans. The researchers at the WEF suggest this could be due to the fact that AI and other automotive tools often help humans perform tasks more efficiently, rather than performing them independently.\n\n25% of all work tasks could be done by AI (Goldman Sachs)\n\nSome jobs involve more tasks that could be entirely automated by AI. For example, 46% of the tasks completed in administrative roles and 44% of tasks done by workers in legal jobs could be performed by AI. However, only 6% of tasks performed in construction and 4% of those done by maintenance workers could be done by AI.\n\n19% of US workers could see more than half of their tasks impacted by AI (OpenAI)\n\nIn this case, \u201cAI\u201d refers specifically to systems that are equivalent to OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4.\n\nTasks that are highly exposed to AI are important in 77% of all jobs (Pew)\n\nAs things stand, AI is far better at some tasks than others. However, the tasks that it is great at, and therefore is most likely to automate, are important or extremely important in 77% of all jobs.\n\n19% of US workers could have at least half of their tasks impacted by LLMs (ARXIV)\n\nThe number of workers who could see the majority of their job automated is relatively small at the minute. However, that 19% still represents hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 and will almost certainly grow as AI tools become more advanced.\n\nEmployers think 42% of tasks will be fully automated by 2027 (WEF)\n\nThat represents a five-point decrease from their 2020 prediction. This more conservative estimate could reflect doubts about whether AI tools will continue improving at the pace they have over the last few years.\n\n65% of tasks related to data processing and information could be fully automated by 2027 (WEF)\n\nThese were the types of tasks most vulnerable to automation. In comparison, employers surveyed by the WEF predict that just 35% of tasks related to reasoning and decision-making could be automated by 2027.\n\nNotable Jobs and Tasks AI Can\u2019t Replace\n\nAI can only economically replace vision-based tasks accounting for just 0.4% of the total wages earned in the US (MIT)\n\nAccording to a 2023 study by researchers at MIT, computer-vision AI can only automate tasks that account for just 1.6% of the wages earned by non-agricultural workers in the US. However, in most cases it would actually be more expensive to switch from humans to AI. Researchers estimated that it would be cheaper to replace just 23% of those wages that are automable.\n\n23% of workers are in the jobs least exposed to AI (Pew)\n\nThe important tasks in these jobs were those resistant to automation. Take nannies, for example. The most important skills required to care for children are not particularly exposed to AI. That makes the job as a whole less exposed to AI than, for example, mechanical drafters.\n\n40% of jobs in emerging markets are exposed to AI (IMF)\n\nEmerging markets are usually less oriented toward services than established, high-income economies. Therefore, they contain fewer jobs that involve tasks that are automable by AI tools.\n\nJust 26% of jobs in low-income countries are exposed to AI (IMF)\n\nThe vast majority of jobs in low-income countries involve tasks that are currently not automable by AI. In part, that\u2019s because significant proportions of workers in low-income countries still work in professions like subsistence agriculture. These roles are automable \u2014 just not by AI tools.\n\n63% of business leaders surveyed by CEPR think AI won\u2019t affect employment rates in high-income countries (CEPR)\n\nWhile 27% think AI will increase unemployment in high-income countries, most respondents were unsure about their answers.\n\nLess than 5% of occupations can be fully automated with current AI technology (McKinsey)\n\nThat being said, 60% of occupations could be impacted by AI, which in this case means fully automatable tasks comprising at least 30% of the total tasks used in a job. These professions could see wage pressure as competition rises due to the automation of key tasks.\n\nHow People Are Responding to the Threat of AI Replacing Jobs\n\nOver the next three years, 120 million workers will undergo retraining due to AI changing business demands (SEO.ai)\n\nTraining is one of the major barriers to the widespread adoption of AI tools. It represents a significant cost burden to any employer considering embracing AI. Nevertheless, tens of millions of workers will be retrained, either to use AI tools or to perform new tasks after old ones are automated by AI.\n\nBuild a winning strategy Get a complete view of your competitors to anticipate trends and lead your market Analyze\n\n42% of employers will prioritize training workers in AI by 2027 (WEF)\n\nEmployers who fail to train their workers in AI may find themselves falling behind their competitors. That could drive this statistic higher in coming years.\n\nCompanies are planning on investing 9% of their collective reskilling efforts in AI and big data (WEF)\n\nThat represents a significant proportion of the collective reskilling budget \u2014 and one that will almost certainly increase if AI adoption continues.\n\nAI is the highest priority in the training strategies of companies with more than 50,000 employees (WEF)\n\nLarger companies are more likely to embrace and fully adopt AI tools, which naturally means more of them will have to make AI training a top priority. Various industries also have AI as the highest priority of their training strategies, including IT services, media and entertainment, telecommunications, and electronics.\n\nAI Causing Widespread Worry Among Workers\n\n30% of workers fear that their job will be replaced with technology by 2025 (PwC)\n\nIn this case, technology includes but is not necessarily limited to AI.\n\n39% of workers are concerned they won\u2019t receive adequate training in new technology (PwC)\n\nKeeping up with technological change is vital if you want to stay afloat in an increasingly competitive workforce. A significant proportion of workers are worried they won\u2019t receive the training necessary to properly use new tech, including AI tools. The same PwC survey found that employees who believe their skills are scarce are far more likely to ask for a pay rise or promotion, feel satisfied with their job, and switch to a new employer.\n\n24% of workers fear that AI will make their job obsolete (SurveyMonkey / CNBC)\n\nThose who are most concerned are younger workers, workers of color, and workers earning lower wages. The fact that lower-wage workers are more worried is interesting, considering the fact that other research shows that those earning higher wages are statistically more likely to be displaced.\n\n43% of workers expect AI to cause their job to significantly change in the next five years (Survey Monkey)\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily bad. However, significant job changes often result in increased pressure and stress due to the need to adapt, especially if an employer does not provide retraining.\n\nJust 32% of employees think their company has been transparent about its use of AI (Asana)\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, workers are less likely to think this if they are lower down in the business hierarchy. While 44% of executives thought their company has been transparent about its AI usage, only 38% of managers agreed, and that figure fell to 25% among individual contributors.\n\n55% of workers think AI will eliminate more jobs than it will create (BMG)\n\nDespite reassurances from leaders in the AI space, people are still wary of this rapidly evolving technology. Just under half of respondents to the same poll said they thought it was likely that humans would eventually lose control of AI systems altogether.\n\nOnly 34% of organizations are reskilling their employees to work with new AI tools (IBM)\n\nThat\u2019s despite the fact that limited skills is the largest barrier faced by enterprises attempting to deploy those AI tools. According to IBM\u2019s research, 20% of companies don\u2019t have employees with the right skills to use new AI tools, and 16% are unable to find new hires to fill this skill gap.\n\nWho is Most Worried About AI Replacing Their Job\n\n81.6% of digital marketers think that content writers will lose jobs due to AI (SEO.ai)\n\nContent production has been one of the industries most impacted by AI, so it\u2019s no surprise the vast majority of those involved in content creation predict jobs will be lost.\n\n52% of people aged 18-24 are worried that AI will negatively impact their future careers (BMG)\n\nYoung workers have the most time ahead of them \u2014 time in which AI tools can become even more advanced, and pose even more of a challenge to human workers. For context, just 39% of all respondents in this poll indicated concern about their future career prospects being negatively impacted by AI.\n\nYoung workers are 129% more likely to be worried than older workers about AI making their job obsolete (SurveyMonkey)\n\nWhile 32% of workers aged 18-24 reported being somewhat or very worried that AI will make their job obsolete soon, only 14% of workers aged 65 and over felt worried. Each intermediate age group felt more worried the younger they were, perhaps reflecting the face that younger workers will likely have to compete against successively more powerful AI models.\n\n38% of Asian workers are worried AI will make their job obsolete, compared to just 19% of white workers (SurveyMonkey)\n\nAsian workers were the most worried, while white workers were the least afraid. In the middle, 32% of Black workers and 35% of Hispanic workers reported feeling concerned about AI making their job obsolete.\n\n30% of workers earning under $50,000 per year are worried that AI will soon make their job obsolete (SurveyMonkey)\n\nInterestingly, lower-income workers were almost twice as likely as higher earners to be worried about AI eliminating their jobs. Just 16% of workers earning over $150,000 reported feeling this stress.\n\nFully remote workers are 42% more likely than fully in-person employees to believe their job will be disrupted by AI (SurveyMonkey)\n\nWhile 54% of fully remote workers think that their job will likely be changed by AI, only 38% of employees who work fully in-person think the same.\n\n51% of workers in advertising and marketing believe their jobs will change due to AI (SurveyMonkey)\n\nThis represents one of the highest proportions of workers predicting job changes of any industry. AI tools are already being used by some companies to promote their products.\n\nWhere AI is Being Adopted\n\nLarger organizations are twice as likely than smaller enterprises to embrace AI (IBM)\n\nAdopting AI comes with often significant costs. Larger organizations that can absorb these upfront expenses are thus more able and likely to adopt AI tools. According to IBM, 60% of larger companies had adopted AI in 2022.\n\n74.9% of organizations are likely to adopt AI by 2027 (WEF)\n\nThis makes AI eighth out of a long list of things companies are considering adopting over the next few years. Ahead of AI are digital platforms, cloud computing, and encryption. Behind AI are climate change mitigation, power storage, and virtual reality.\n\n42% of companies with over 1,000 employees have actively deployed AI (IBM)\n\nAnother 40% of enterprise-scale companies have explored AI, but not yet deployed it in their business. In total, that means just 18% of large companies have not tried AI at all.\n\nAI\u2019s Potential to Create New Careers\n\n81% of office workers hold a generally favorable view of AI (SnapLogic)\n\nAI might be taking some of their jobs, but office workers are still overwhelmingly positive about the new technology. More than four-fifths believe it improves their job performance and experience at work.\n\n51% of office workers say AI lets them achieve better work-life balance (SnapLogic)\n\nThe utopian promise of AI, spread by major proponents like Elon Musk, is a world where work isn\u2019t necessary at all. For the minute, however, work remains one part of the work-life balance. A majority of workers are using AI to push the scale further toward \u201clife.\u201d\n\n25.6% of organizations surveyed by the WEF expect AI to create jobs (WEF)\n\nThe business leaders polled by the WEF were quite divided over AI\u2019s potential impact, indicating the general uncertainty surrounding the ramifications of widespread AI adoption. A little under half of those surveyed believe it will create jobs, while a little under a quarter think it will eliminate jobs on balance. The degree of disagreement over AI\u2019s impact on jobs was higher than for any other change included in the poll.\n\nBetween 2023 and 2027, the profession with the largest net job growth worldwide will be \u201cAI and Machine Learning Specialist\u201d (WEF)\n\nAll of the professions that topped this ranking were new. That means there are few existing jobs to lose but many to gain, resulting in a huge net growth. The professions with the largest predicted raw growth in jobs were quite unexposed to AI: agricultural equipment operators, heavy truck and bus drivers, and so on. Each of these professions will likely add over two million jobs worldwide by 2027. For comparison, about one million \u201cAI and Machine Learning Specialist\u201d jobs are predicted to appear over the same timeframe.\n\nHaving access to an LLM resulted in 15% of employee tasks being completed faster with no loss in quality (ARXIV)\n\nBy allowing employees to complete more work in the same amount of time, AI tools might induce employers to cut back on workers.\n\nMiscellaneous Stats About AI Replacing Jobs\n\n17% of British workers think they can often or always tell when they are using an AI (ONS)\n\nWorkers are more likely to be confident they can spot an AI if they are male, younger, or with a degree.\n\n26% of workers think they are considered lazy if they use AI (Asana)\n\nWhile the vast majority of workers aren\u2019t worried about using AI tools, a significant proportion worry it could negatively impact how people view their work ethic. That\u2019s not an unreasonable concern, as being considered lazy could mean being passed up for a pay rise or promotion.\n\n18% of workers feel like a fraud when they use AI for work (Asana)\n\nDebates around the proper use of AI continue. The direction of popular culture will have a significant impact on this statistic. Will people accept the use of AI for work, or make it unacceptable?\n\n15% of US workers are open to having an AI boss (Asana)\n\nAmericans are apparently more receptive to the idea of having a robot boss than British workers. Just 8% of workers in the UK said they\u2019d be open to this idea.\n\nOne-third of all US jobs created in the last quarter-century didn\u2019t exist before (McKinsey)\n\nTechnically, these jobs either didn\u2019t exist or \u201cbarely existed.\u201d Technological advancements can eliminate jobs, but they often create entirely new professions that no one could have predicted.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith AI still advancing so rapidly, even experts are in disagreement about the exact effect this new technology will have on global employment.\n\nOn the one hand, AI may well lead to widespread job losses. However, it\u2019s already improving the work lives of millions of employees.\n\nOn the other hand, AI is set to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. And yet millions of people have already been replaced by robots.\n\nRegardless, as AI continues to advance and be adopted, its impact on the global workforce \u2014 positive or negative \u2014 will only increase.",

As AI models improve and the tools become more sophisticated, their range of abilities grows dramatically. The jobs most at risk involve routine tasks, where AI can easily step in to handle repetitive work more efficiently. Understanding the top 10 roles likely to be replaced by AI, why they\u2019re most vulnerable, and what it means for workers can help you make more informed decisions about your career and build the skills that will matter most in the future.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2022 Jobs in the manufacturing, healthcare, and customer service industries are most at risk of AI replacement because these sectors rely heavily on routine, repetitive tasks that can be automated. (Jump to Section)\n\n(Jump to Section) \u2022 Building skills that AI can\u2019t replace, investing in continuous learning, and staying adaptable are some of the steps you can take to prepare for an AI-driven job market. (Jump to Section)\n\n(Jump to Section) \u2022 Aside from job losses, the economic impacts of AI job replacement also include increased productivity and potential income inequality. (Jump to Section)\n\nTop 10 Jobs AI Will Replace\n\nThe table below shows an overview of what jobs will AI replace in the future, including the likelihood of AI replacing each role and the expected job growth by 2030. Most of these positions are projected to decline, with a few showing only minimal growth. Source: Will Robots Take My Job?\n\nData Entry Clerks\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 95%\n\nData entry clerks are at a high risk of being replaced by AI mainly because their work involves tedious, structured tasks that AI can automate easily. AI tools can quickly process large amounts of data with minimal errors, saving time and money for companies. With advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and optical character recognition (OCR), AI can manage unstructured data, like handwritten notes or scanned documents, more effectively. Since AI can do these tasks much faster, businesses are more likely to rely less on human data entry in the future.\n\nTelemarketers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 94%\n\nThis role is likely to be replaced by AI because the job focuses on following scripts and managing routine customer interactions, tasks that AI can now do just as well, if not faster. AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants can make calls, answer questions, and even personalize conversations based on customer data. Additionally, these tools are available 24/7, don\u2019t need breaks, and can handle multiple calls at once, making them a cost-effective alternative to human telemarketers.\n\nBookkeepers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 94%\n\nBookkeepers are at serious risk of being replaced by AI because their work is straightforward and repetitive\u2014exactly what AI tools are built for. AI-powered software can track expenses, reconcile accounts, and even generate financial reports more quickly and accurately than people can. These systems can also connect directly to bank accounts and other financial platforms, so there\u2019s no need for manual data entry. Businesses typically look for ways to cut costs and save time, making bookkeepers highly vulnerable to automation.\n\nReceptionists\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 92%\n\nReceptionists face a significant risk of being replaced by AI as automated systems like virtual assistants become capable of managing calls, scheduling and visitor check-ins. These AI tools save costs and complete routine tasks smoothly and without breaks. While human receptionists can build rapport and address complex issues, businesses might prioritize the round-the-clock availability of AI, especially when dealing with high volumes of routine inquiries.\n\nRetail Cashiers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 89%\n\nThe jobs of retail cashiers are increasingly at risk of AI replacement as self-checkout systems and automated payment technologies become more common. These systems let customers scan and pay for items on their own, eliminating the need for someone to operate a register. AI advances are also allowing stores to use the Just Walk Out technology, where sensors and cameras automatically charge customers for items as they leave. For companies, these AI solutions mean lower labor costs and accelerated checkout times.\n\nManufacturing Workers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 88%\n\nManufacturing jobs are under threat because AI and robotics can now take over many physical tasks. Machines can perform everything from assembling products to inspecting them, often with greater consistency than human workers. Automation is particularly useful for tasks requiring high precision or repeated movements, as robots don\u2019t tire and can be programmed to to work non-stop.\n\nBank Tellers\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 88%\n\nBank tellers are facing a high chance of AI replacement due to the rise of digital banking and automated systems. With more customers using mobile banking apps and online platforms for everyday transactions, in-person banking becomes unnecessary. ATMs and self-service kiosks are also taking over basic tasks, like cash deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. These systems are not only quicker but also reduce the costs associated with maintaining a large, in-person staff.\n\nProofreaders\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 86%\n\nProofreading jobs are vulnerable to AI because many of their tasks can now be done by advanced editing software. AI-powered grammar checkers and style editors can spot errors in text faster than humans can, from typos to sentence structure issues. In addition, these programs are constantly updated to recognize more complex language patterns, making them a practical choice for companies looking to cut down on costs. Even though human editors will still be required for complex tasks, AI is steadily taking over more of the routine, error-catching work traditionally done by proofreaders.\n\nCustomer Service Representatives\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 80%\n\nCustomer service representatives are on the list of jobs AI will replace due to AI chatbots and virtual assistants growing more adept at managing routine inquiries, such as account updates and order tracking. These tools give businesses a cost-effective way to provide 24/7 support while handling requests simultaneously. However, human representatives may still be indispensable for emotionally charged situations where empathy is necessary.\n\nTranslators\n\nAI Replacement Risk: 71%\n\nTranslators are seeing their roles shift as AI-supported language tools become more sophisticated, processing text in real-time, translating accurately in dozens of languages. These tools are now able to pick upon context and tone, which were once areas where humans had the advantage. For routine tasks, like translating documents or basic conversations, AI can often do the job faster at little to no cost. Human translators might still be needed for highly nuanced or creative work, the demand for traditional translation services is likely to decrease as these technologies continue to develop.\n\nPreparing for an AI-Driven Job Market\n\nAI will continue to transform industries. Preparing for the changing job market is more important than ever. It\u2019s undeniable that AI will take over, if not eliminate, some jobs, but it will also create new opportunities. Developing a mix of new skills and a mindset that welcomes change will help you thrive in this environment. Here\u2019s what you can do to make yourself more valuable:\n\nWork on Skills AI Can\u2019t Replace: Automation can deal with routine tasks efficiently, but human traits, such as creativity and empathy, are irreplaceable. These skills will be even more valuable as routine work is automated. Focus on critical thinking, problem-solving, and building personal connections, areas where humans still have a distinct advantage.\n\nAutomation can deal with routine tasks efficiently, but human traits, such as creativity and empathy, are irreplaceable.

Workers who can pivot quickly and pick up new tools will be in demand as new roles will call for constant flexibility. Understand AI and Its Limitations: Because AI plays a large role in the workplace, it\u2019s imperative to understand both its strengths and limitations. While it\u2019s hard to beat at data processing because of its speed and accuracy, it struggles with complex decision-making and creativity. By recognizing these limitations, you can use AI tools effectively and concentrate on areas where human judgment remains essential.\n\nBecause AI plays a large role in the workplace, it\u2019s imperative to understand both its strengths and limitations.

By recognizing these limitations, you can use AI tools effectively and concentrate on areas where human judgment remains essential. Explore AI-Proof Jobs: If you\u2019re considering a career shift, explore roles that rely on human interaction, hands-on expertise, and skills that are difficult for machines to replicate. Professions like chefs and social workers need nuanced decision-making and emotional intelligence, which machines cannot duplicate. Pursuing these AI-proof jobs can offer stability in a future where automation seems unstoppable.\n\nThe Economic Impacts of AI Job Replacement\n\nAI continues to mold industries and job markets, and its economic impact goes far beyond job displacement. While the technology introduces substantial benefits, it also raises serious concerns about inequality, workforce transitions, and ethical implications.\n\nIncreased Productivity and Economic Expansion\n\nAI-driven automation is poised to boost productivity, contributing an estimated $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This expansion will primarily come from enhanced efficiency and increased consumer demand, with the healthcare, finance, and manufacturing sectors standing to benefit the most. The challenge, however, is making sure that this improvement is not limited to just a few industries or companies. If the benefits are concentrated in a small group, the broader economy could face widening inequality.\n\nJob Losses and Workforce Displacement\n\nAccording to SEO.AI, AI could potentially replace around 800 million jobs worldwide by 2030. Job losses are to be expected in various sectors, with automation replacing basic roles. Workers in manufacturing, retail, and customer service industries are particularly vulnerable. As AI takes over repetitive tasks, the shift in the workforce may cause disruptions and lead to retraining requirements for displaced workers.\n\nIncome Disparity\n\nAI is set to widen the income gap, especially in lower-wage sectors, like retail, food service, and manufacturing. A Brookings Institution report found that more than 30 percent of workers could see half of their tasks disrupted by generative AI. On the other hand, higher-paying, skilled positions in STEM, business, and finance industries are more likely to benefit from AI. Simply put, the economic gains from AI could disproportionately favor those with higher skills, leaving lower-income workers behind and making income inequality worse.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhich Industries Are Most Affected by AI? AI is having a major impact on the manufacturing, healthcare, and customer service industries by automating tasks that were previously done by humans. In manufacturing, automation replaces manual labor on production lines. In healthcare, AI is handling diagnostics and administrative tasks. Meanwhile, in customer service, AI chatbots manage routine support roles, reducing the need for human involvement in simple inquiries. Will AI Create More Jobs Than it Replaces? AI is expected to create new job opportunities, particularly in AI development, data analysis, and machine learning fields. These new roles usually come with competitive AI job salaries, reflecting the specialized skills necessary. That said, the number of AI careers may not fully offset the jobs lost to automation. The effect will depend on how industries adjust, with higher-paying roles in tech, but fewer traditional jobs in more automated industries. What Skills Are Needed to Work Alongside AI? To work alongside AI, you must gain skills in data analysis, machine learning, and critical thinking. You can also take AI-related courses or self-paced AI certifications to learn AI in detail. Developing these skills will help you collaborate with AI technologies in various sectors.\n\nConclusion: Navigating the AI-Driven Job Landscape\n\nThe job market is undergoing a significant transformation, and while some roles become obsolete or face automation, others are emerging in response to new demands. Adapting to this shift means focusing on continuous learning and cultivating skills that AI cannot easily duplicate. Invest in human-centric abilities and skills that would complement new technologies to remain relevant and resilient as the nature of work evolves.\n\nFind out which businesses are setting the new standards in AI by reading about the top AI companies and NLP companies.",

        "text": "A recent survey found that 41 percent of employers across the globe have plans to fire your ass and replace you with an AI that can do your job.\n\nWhether or not AI will ever advance to the point where it can fully replicate the intricacies of a human\u2019s effort, creativity, attention to detail, and outside-the-box thinking enough to fully replace a person, even for the most menial job, is another matter altogether.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nOn the bright side, if these cost-cutting scumbags are to be believed, 77 percent of companies also said that they would focus on \u201creskilling\u201d and \u201cupscaling\u201d existing employees between 2025 and 2030. This means workers won\u2019t necessarily be replaced by AI but be taught how to work alongside it.\n\nYou know the person who oversees the self-checkout lanes at CVS/the grocery store/Home Depot? That. They have plans to turn you into that, a babysitter for technology and a workflow still in its infancy. Sounds fulfilling. Spiritually uplifting, even.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the World Economic Forum, or WEF, provided a handy list of the kinds of jobs that companies are looking to replace. Postal Service clerks, executive secretaries, payroll clerks, basically anyone with a job primarily consisting of routine administrative tasks. Graphic designers are another big one that AI is predicted to replace.\n\nThe report says that while you may lose whatever job you have now, nearly 70 percent of companies intend to hire employees with experience in designing AI tools. Meanwhile, 62 percent are going to start recruiting people who can work alongside AI, which sounds a lot like they\u2019re looking for people who won\u2019t feel resentful of a technology that\u2019s taking a job that could\u2019ve been theirs.\n\nAll of this stands in stark contrast to the WEF\u2019s 2023 report that said that AI would bring about a \u201cnet positive\u201d for job numbers. One year later, the report predicts massive job losses and what sounds like no real plan of what those people are going to do for a living other than the insulting suggestion that they become stewards of the technology that replaced them.",

        "text": "For better or worse, everyone should brace for impact in the age of AI.\n\nMore than half of the employee population of Korea will see their roles transformed by AI \u2013 or, worse, lose their jobs because of it.\n\nA recent joint report by the Bank of Korea and the International Monetary Fund shines a spotlight on the tectonic shift AI is set to unleash upon the Korean workforce.\n\nJobs most at risk of AI displacement\n\nThe study dissected AI\u2019s impact on jobs through two key lenses:\n\nOccupational AI exposure \u2013 how vulnerable a job is to AI replacement\n\nAI complementarity \u2013 how much human ingenuity shields roles from the threat of automation\n\nThe findings paint a picture of a workforce at a crossroads. Some are poised to ride the AI wave, while others risk being swept away.\n\nA striking 24% of Korean workers sit in the high-exposure, high-complementarity category, meaning AI is more likely to serve as a powerful ally, supercharging their productivity rather than replacing them.\n\nHowever, for 27% of workers in the high-exposure, low-complementarity camp, the outlook is far less rosy. Their roles stand on shaky ground, making them more susceptible to wage cuts and redundancy.\n\nDemographic shifts mean AI\u2019s rise is a double-edged sword.\n\nWomen, younger professionals, and highly educated, high-earning workers are more likely to find themselves in the AI sweet spot \u2013 high exposure yet high complementarity \u2013 suggesting that, for them, AI is a springboard rather than a stumbling block.\n\nProfessions standing to gain the most include doctors, corporate executives, professors, and financial specialists \u2013 roles where human expertise remains irreplaceable.\n\nBy contrast, jobs in accounting, clerical work, IT system management, and telemarketing find themselves in AI\u2019s direct line of fire, as automation looms large over their future.\n\nAlso Read: Singapore employees doubt their bosses' AI implementation skills\n\nThe benefits of AI amid risks of economic slowdown\n\nBeyond individual career prospects, however, the ripple effects of AI on the broader economy are profound.\n\nThe report estimates widespread AI adoption could crank up overall productivity by 1.1% to 3.2%, potentially adding a hefty 4.2% to 12.6% to GDP growth \u2013 an economic tailwind too significant to ignore.\n\nHowever, these projections come with caveats: the pace of AI adoption and its precise economic impact remain uncertain.\n\nWhat is clearer is that larger, more established corporations are likely to reap the most substantial gains from AI-driven efficiencies.\n\nThe urgency for AI adoption is underscored by Korea\u2019s demographic challenges. With a declining birth rate and an ageing population, the country faces a potential GDP contraction of 16.5% between 2023 and 2050, according to United Nations forecasts.\n\nHowever, AI integration could soften this blow, reducing the expected GDP decline to just 5.9% by supplementing human labour and bolstering productivity.\n\nA key determinant of the success of AI adoption in Korea will be the ability of the workforce to transition from high-exposure, low-complementarity jobs to more AI-augmented roles.\n\nYet, historical data from the Korea Labor and Income Panel Study reveals that workers tend to remain in similar fields when switching jobs. Between 2009 and 2022, only 31% successfully transitioned to roles that offered greater protection from automation.\n\nAlso Read: AI agents that work like humans\n\nIs Korea ready for the impact of AI on jobs?\n\nOn a global scale, Korea is better prepared for AI disruption than most advanced economies. The nation ranks 15th out of 165 countries in the AI Preparedness Index, excelling in \u201cinnovation and economic integration\u201d at No. 3, and performing relatively well in \u201cregulation and policy\u201d (No. 18) and \u201cdigital infrastructure\u201d (No. 18).\n\nHowever, the report also highlights shortcomings in \u201chuman capital utilisation and labour market policies\u201d. Further efforts are needed to maximise AI benefits.\n\nThe findings prove the necessity of strategic intervention. \u201cTargeted policies are needed to enhance labour market flexibility through education and retraining programs while simultaneously strengthening social safety nets for vulnerable groups,\u201d the report said.\n\nWithout a robust reskilling agenda and a stronger safety net, the AI revolution could leave many workers behind.\n\nThe call to action is evident for talent leaders: leverage the potential of AI while safeguarding employees from displacement.\n\nThe future of work in Korea will not be dictated by technology alone \u2013 it will be shaped by the policies and leadership that guide its integration.",

        "text": "More than 10 per cent of jobs in India and nearly a fifth in the Philippines could be lost to AI. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nMANILA \u2013 Indian entrepreneur Suumit Shah took to Twitter in July to describe his experience with generative artificial intelligence: \u201cWe had to lay off 90 per cent of our support team because of this AI chatbot. Tough? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nWith the chatbot, queries to his e-commerce site dukaan.com took just over three minutes to resolve from more than two hours earlier, and customer support costs fell by about 85 per cent, said Mr Shah, the chief executive.\n\nMr Shah\u2019s tweet, which has had more than 2.6 million views, drew mixed responses, with some congratulating him for embracing the technology and getting good results, while others berated him as \u201cheartless\u201d for laying off nearly 30 employees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me who is going to decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of people employed in areas where generative AI is being deployed; it\u2019s up to them to see how AI is changing their jobs and learn, as not all employers have the resources to train employees,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nGenerative AI has been widely hailed as the next big growth driver in technology. The launch of San Francisco-based OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot to the public in November set off a global frenzy, with more than one million downloads in the first week.\n\nSince then, the AI-based tool and image-generating tools such as Midjourney have been incorporated in education, marketing, customer service, online search and content creation, with users touting greater efficiency and reduced costs.\n\nBut lawmakers and some tech experts in Asia have warned of a lack of regulation to prevent misuse, the risk of privacy violations and misinformation, and the potential for income inequality as certain types of jobs are automated faster than others.\n\n\u201cUnequal access to AI tools can worsen socioeconomic disparities, favouring those with greater resources and leaving marginalised communities behind,\u201d said Mr Kazim Rizvi, founding director of The Dialogue, a policy think-tank in Delhi.\n\n\u201cThis imbalance can lead to a concentration of power and influence in the hands of a few, while others are left behind without the means to participate fully in the AI-driven economy,\u201d he said.\n\nAsian nations have been slow to regulate AI or introduce ethical frameworks, lagging behind the United States\u2019 AI Bill of Rights that offers guidelines for the responsible design and use of AI, and the European Union\u2019s proposed AI Act that imposes tough standards.\n\nSkewed datasets\n\nAbout 18 per cent of work globally could be automated by AI, and 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to generative AI, according to Goldman Sachs, which estimates that AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7 per cent.\n\nWhile fewer jobs in emerging markets are exposed to automation than developed markets, more than 10 per cent of jobs in India and nearly a fifth in the Philippines could be lost to AI, Goldman Sachs said in the report earlier this year.\n\nIn China, AI-generated models are fast replacing human models in fashion catalogues and on shopping websites. An AI-generated model even featured on the cover of Vogue Singapore\u2019s March issue, pitched as \u201cfashion meets the AI revolution\u201d.\n\nChina also launched what it claimed was the world\u2019s first AI news anchor in 2018. Since then, they have also been introduced in Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, where networks claim greater speed and cost savings.\n\nIn India, AI anchors \u2013 from Sana in a skirt on Aaj Tak channel to saree-clad Lisa on Odisha TV \u2013 present news bulletins, horoscopes, weather and sports updates in English, Hindi and several regional languages.\n\nAlso in India, the high court for Punjab and Haryana states earlier in 2023 turned to ChatGPT to decide whether to award bail for a suspect in a murder case \u201cto present a broader picture on bail jurisprudence where cruelty is a factor\u201d.\n\nBut while technology is aimed at efficiency, \u201cefficiency does not always amount to justice\u201d, said Ms Urvashi Aneja, founding director at Digital Futures Lab, a research collective.\n\n\u201cSkewed datasets used to build these databases for AI tools can lead to biased outcomes, especially for marginalised groups who may be over- or under-represented in datasets,\u201d she said, adding that there are also risks of exclusion and privacy violations.\n\n\u2018Daunting challenge\u2019\n\nFew countries have introduced regulations to govern generative AI, with China\u2019s \u201cinterim\u201d rules, due to take effect on Aug 15, prioritising safety concerns and copyright protections.\n\nIn Singapore, which has an AI governance framework, the Government is an early adopter, with civil servants using a version of ChatGPT for research and speech writing, while being \u201caccountable for their work and responsible for fact-checking and vetting AI-generated content\u201d.\n\nSingapore in July launched a programme with Google Cloud to identify 100 \u201creal-world challenges\u201d in the Government and industry that can be addressed with generative AI, and to build AI solutions for them.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Philippines, there are real fears that generative AI could soon take over jobs in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector that employs about 1.3 million workers and generates US$30 billion (S$40 billion) a year, or about 7 per cent of the nation\u2019s GDP.\n\nCiting research that forecast at least 1.1 million jobs in the Philippines will disappear by 2028 due to AI, Senator Imee Marcos filed a resolution in May to examine the use of AI in call centres and factories in the country.\n\n\u201cAI is developing faster than most people can comprehend and is threatening to take away jobs and turn employment growth upside down,\u201d she said.\n\nRegulators must \u201cdeal squarely with an inevitable technological tsunami\u201d before the widespread adoption of AI in business to guard against \u201csevere unemployment\u201d, she said.\n\nFor Mr Jo Gavino, a former BPO worker who now advocates for BPO workers\u2019 rights, this is already the reality.\n\nHe and his former colleagues at a BPO centre were trained \u2013 but only to \u201ckeep up with AI\u201d by responding quicker, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like telling us we need to be better than the AI chatbots,\u201d said Mr Gavino, 24, who volunteers for the BPO Industry Employees\u2019 Network and is chair of the Outsourced Workers League, an advocacy group.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that AI will help reduce our workload, but what is actually happening is it seems to replace human labour.\u201d REUTERS\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

However, he also shared that 1,000 new positions will be added in AI, CNA reports.\n\nIn my 15 years of being a CEO, for the first time, I\u2019m struggling to create jobs. So far, I\u2019ve always had a line of sight to what jobs I can create. This time, I\u2019m struggling to say how I will repurpose people to create jobs. Piyush Gupta, outgoing CEO of DBS Group Holdings at a industry conference in Mumbai, India\n\nCurrently, the company has 8,000 to 9,000 employees in such positions and has a total headcount of around 41,000 staff.\n\nResponding to media enquiries from Vulcan Post, a spokesperson from DBS shared that the reduction in headcount will come from \u201cnatural attrition\u201d as temporary and contract roles are completed in the next few years.\n\nOver the next 3 years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/ contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects. As such, we expect the reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as these temporary and contract roles are completed over the next few years. Our permanent staff across all our markets are not impacted. A DBS spokesperson responding to media enquiries from Vulcan Post\n\nAI replacing human roles at banks\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) article in January, global banks will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as AI encroaches on tasks currently carried out by human workers.\n\nChief information and technology officers surveyed for BI indicated that, on average, they expect a net 3% of their workforce to be cut. The report also shared that back and middle office roles and operations are most likely to be affected.\n\n\u201cAny jobs involving routine, repetitive tasks are at risk. But AI will not eliminate them fully, rather it will lead to workforce transformation,\u201d stated Tomasz Noetzel, a senior analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, who also penned the report.\n\nHowever, this might lean more towards a \u201cutopian view\u201d for some, like Gupta. While he appreciated the perspective that people will continue to find jobs, he warned that there might be \u201cmassive dislocations,\u201d The Hindu reports.\n\n\u201cWe are getting a lot of jobs, the cyber security specialists, the AI people. But a lot of my traditional operations people, the clerical staff, all the time, it\u2019s not easy for them to transition [to new jobs created],\u201d said the banking veteran, highlighting the effects of AI on jobs.\n\nBut not all hope is lost\n\nWith that said, there are ways for those in similar positions to \u201cchange\u201d your predicament. We previously reported the five skills that Singaporeans can build to do what machines can\u2019t. Here\u2019s a list:\n\nData analysis and critical thinking skills Building functional and job-specific expertise Project Management Creativity Advanced digital skills (eg. programming, AI literacy, etc)\n\nHowever, we also found that 19% of Singaporeans dedicate no time to reskill, which is above the regional average of 13%. This is where employers can play a pivotal role in helping employees build up their arsenal beyond degrees and paper qualifications.\n\nWhen asked how they intend to reassure their permanent staff in terms of job security, a DBS spokesperson expressed the company\u2019s commitment to continue investing in upskilling and reskilling its employees to be \u201cfuture-ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have identified around 13,000 staff for upskilling or reskilling and to date, over 10,000 have commenced their respective learning roadmaps, including on skills such as AI and data.\u201d\n\nRead more articles on Artificial Intelligence here.\n\nRead more articles we have written on Singaporean businesses here.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: DBS Bank",

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nIBM to pause hiring for jobs that AI could do: CEO\n\n- IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna said the company expects to pause hiring for roles that it thinks could be replaced with artificial intelligence (AI) in the coming years.\n\nHiring for back-office functions \u2013 such as human resources \u2013 will be suspended or slowed, Mr Krishna said in an interview.\n\nThese non-customer-facing roles involve roughly 26,000 workers, Mr Krishna added.\n\n\u201cI can easily see 30 per cent of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period,\u201d he said.\n\nThat would mean roughly 7,800 jobs lost.\n\nPart of any reduction would include not replacing roles vacated by attrition, an IBM spokesman said.\n\nAI tools have captured the public imagination with their ability to automate customer service, write text and generate code, and many observers have expressed concern about their potential to disrupt the labour market.\n\nMr Krishna\u2019s plan marks one of the largest workforce strategies announced in response to the rapidly advancing technology.\n\nMore mundane tasks such as providing employment verification letters or moving employees between departments will likely be fully automated, Mr Krishna said.\n\nSome human resource functions, such as evaluating workforce composition and productivity, probably will not be replaced over the next decade, he added.\n\nIBM currently employs about 260,000 workers and continues to hire for software development and customer-facing roles. Finding talent is easier today than a year ago, Mr Krishna said.\n\nThe company announced job cuts earlier in 2023, which may affect about 5,000 workers once completed.\n\nStill, Mr Krishna said IBM has added to its workforce overall, bringing on about 7,000 people in the first quarter.\n\nMr Krishna, who has been CEO since 2020, has worked to focus the century-old company on software and services such as hybrid cloud.\n\nHe has divested lower-growth businesses like managed infrastructure unit Kyndryl and part of the Watson Health business.\n\nThe company is considering selling its weather unit.\n\nIBM topped profit estimates in its most recent quarter due to expense management, including the earlier-announced job cuts.\n\nNew productivity and efficiency steps are expected to drive US$2 billion (S$2.67 billion) a year in savings by the end of 2024, it said.\n\nUntil late 2022, Mr Krishna said he believed that the United States could avoid a recession.\n\nNow, he sees the potential for a \u201cshallow and short\u201d recession towards the end of 2023.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong software portfolio, including acquired unit Red Hat, should help it maintain steady growth despite worsening macroeconomic concerns, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Anurag Rana last week.

In fact, it\u2019s a worry that a number of high-ranking executives globally have become wary of over the last year. As AI systems become increasingly powerful, what\u2019s to say they\u2019re not going to come for the top jobs?\n\nIn a survey conducted by edX last year, nearly half (49%) of CEOs said they believe most or all of their jobs could be automated or replaced by AI, compared to just 20% of IT workers.\n\nGet the ITPro. daily newsletter Receive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Up until now, it\u2019s all been rather abstract for them and these considerations have largely been reserved for workers lower down in the pecking order.\n\nThe hens will come home to roost very soon. Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be the rest of the workforce that bears the brunt of this trend first. Replacing the calculated business minds of human executives with the cold, callous reasoning of an AI model doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\n\nBut as companies like Meta move to replace software engineers with AI , executives will only set a precedent for widespread replacement of human positions by machines \u2013 and who\u2019s to say even the best leaders can\u2019t be replaced by an algorithm down the line?\n\nAI job losses aren\u2019t quite so abstract anymore\n\nAI-related job losses have become a contentious talking point over the last two years, and a topic that seems to have been divided into several camps.\n\nThe alarmists are unwavering in their belief that the technology will result in widespread social and economic upheaval , while others appear to view it as no different to previous eras of industrial change. A natural evolution of the business world, some would have you believe.\n\nResearch from Goldman Sachs in early 2023 painted a grim picture for the future of workers globally, suggesting that anywhere up to 300 million jobs could be lost to automation as the industry accelerates the adoption of generative AI tools. More recently, the emergence of agentic AI has further fuelled concerns about job losses.\n\nHaving AI tools to support the human worker is one thing \u2013 having an AI agent perform tasks on their behalf is an entirely different ball game and perhaps is a serious cause for concern.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen some examples of AI resulting in cuts. In mid-2023, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna announced plans to automate HR roles in a move that will see thousands of jobs cut in the coming years.\n\nHowever, the onslaught of job losses hasn\u2019t quite materialized so far. That\u2019s not to suggest that this reality isn\u2019t still looming over our heads, but it\u2019s by and large been confined to the realms of research papers, op-eds, and grave warnings from industry stakeholders. But make no mistake: these workers represent the lifeblood of an organization and I\u2019d say that losing out on your top talent across critical functions could inflict a heavier toll on an enterprise than having a CEO replaced.\n\nRELATED WHITEPAPER (Image credit: Dell) Get value from your data\n\nSpeaking at Nvidia\u2019s AI Summit in Mumbai in October last year, Huang said that while AI has the potential to automate aspects of human roles, he has no concerns that his own would be replaced by AI - nor those of other senior executives.\n\nThe likelihood of CEOs losing their jobs to AI is minimal, largely due to the fact they have a vested interest in maintaining their own position while reaping the rewards of cutting staff in favor of the technology. An AI CEO might deliver shareholder value, but it won\u2019t wax lyrical in earnings calls.\n\nIf it happens, and that\u2019s a big \u2018if\u2019, there will be a few major industry figures looking over their shoulders.",

        "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), once a concept confined to science fiction, has become an integral part of our daily lives.\n\nYet, as this powerful technology continues to evolve, it brings with it a pressing question:\n\nCan AI replace our jobs?\n\nThis question is not merely speculative\u2014it is a reality that millions of workers, businesses, and policymakers are grappling with today.\n\nThe rapid advancement of AI has already begun to reshape industries, automate tasks, and redefine the skills required to thrive in the modern workforce.\n\nWhile some view AI as a harbinger of progress, offering unprecedented efficiency and innovation, others fear it may lead to widespread job displacement and economic disruption.\n\nBelow are 10 critical points to consider when evaluating whether AI can replace our jobs.\n\n1. Automation of repetitive tasks\n\nAI is highly effective at automating repetitive, rule-based tasks, such as data processing, inventory management, and basic customer service.\n\nJobs centred around these activities are more susceptible to displacement.\n\n2. Augmentation, not just replacement\n\nAI is often a tool for enhancing human productivity rather than replacing workers entirely.\n\nMany roles will evolve, with AI handling routine tasks while employees focus on higher-value responsibilities like strategy, creativity, and innovation.\n\n3. Sector-specific vulnerability\n\nCertain industries, such as manufacturing, logistics, and retail, are more likely to experience job displacement due to AI-driven automation.\n\nConversely, sectors requiring emotional intelligence, complex decision-making, and interpersonal skills are less likely to be fully automated.\n\n4. Emergence of new opportunities\n\nHistorically, technological advancements have created new job categories.\n\nAI is no exception, as it is driving demand for roles in AI development, machine learning engineering, data analysis, and AI ethics.\n\n5. The Imperative of upskilling\n\nTo remain competitive in an AI-driven economy, workers must prioritise continuous learning and skill development.\n\nProficiency in digital tools, programming, and AI-related technologies will be increasingly valuable.\n\n6. Limitations of AI\n\nWhile AI excels at data analysis and pattern recognition, it cannot replicate human creativity, empathy, and ethical judgement.\n\nThese uniquely human traits ensure that many roles will remain irreplaceable by AI.\n\n7. Human-AI collaboration\n\nThe future of work will likely involve synergistic collaboration between humans and AI.\n\nFor instance, AI can assist medical professionals in diagnosing conditions, but the final treatment decisions will rely on human expertise and judgement.\n\n8. Ethical and social considerations\n\nThe integration of AI into the workforce raises important ethical questions, including concerns about bias, transparency, and accountability.\n\nAddressing these issues is essential to ensuring equitable outcomes for workers.\n\n9. Variable impact across industries\n\nThe extent of AI\u2019s impact will vary by sector. Industries like healthcare, education, and the arts, which rely heavily on human interaction and creativity, will experience slower adoption of AI compared to more technical or data-driven fields.\n\n10.

The peer group covered by BI includes Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe findings point to far-reaching changes in the industry, feeding through to improved earnings. In 2027, banks could see pre-tax profits 12 to 17 per cent higher than they would otherwise have been \u2013 adding as much as US$180 billion to their combined bottom line \u2013 as AI powers an increase in productivity, according to BI.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.

About 54 per cent of jobs across banking have a high potential to be automated, Citi said at the time.\n\nStill, many firms have stressed that the shift will result in roles being changed by technology, rather than replaced altogether. Teresa Heitsenrether, who oversees JPMorgan\u2019s AI efforts, said in November that the bank\u2019s adoption of generative AI was so far augmenting jobs.\n\nJamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive officer, told Bloomberg Television in 2023 that AI is likely to make dramatic improvement in workers\u2019 quality of life, even if it eliminates some positions.\n\n\u201cYour children are going to live to 100 and not have cancer because of technology,\u201d Dimon said at the time. \u201cAnd literally they\u2019ll probably be working three-and-a-half days a week.\u201d BLOOMBERG",

        "text": "\"AI will be the end of programmers everywhere,\" an article I recently read declared.\n\nThe author argued that with AI and a trend called \"Vibecoding,\" even people with no technical background can now build applications. Instead of writing code, they just tell the AI what they want and tweak its output until they get the right result.\n\nTo prove their point, they shared their own experience. With zero programming knowledge\u2014no Python, java script, or C++\u2014they managed to build a podcast transcription and summarization tool, a social media organizing app, a website to check if furniture would fit in their car, and even a fridge-scanning app that suggests lunch ideas for their son.\n\nA person is coding on their computer. Illustration photo by Pexels\n\nAt first glance, that might sound like AI is replacing programmers. But that assumption misses the bigger picture. Many people think programming is just about making simple apps or websites, which are things Microsoft Excel could probably handle. By that logic, memorizing a list of medicines would make someone a pharmacist, or holding a chisel and hammer would turn someone into a sculptor.\n\nIf we assume programming is dying just because AI can spit out some basic code, we are oversimplifying the reality of software development. Anyone who has built real software knows it is not just about writing a few lines of code - it is about solving complex problems. AI is not here to replace programmers; it is here to raise the bar.\n\nLike in every other industry, AI is reshaping programming. Sure, those who only learned basic coding from short courses might struggle, but experienced developers see AI as a powerful tool. Apps like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot help automate repetitive tasks like debugging, formatting code, and writing boilerplate, ultimately freeing developers to focus on the difficult things like system architecture, performance optimization, and data security.\n\nBut no matter how advanced AI gets, it cannot replace human reasoning, creativity, or problem-solving. Building real applications is not as simple as typing a prompt and letting AI do the rest. It takes structured thinking and decision-making that only experienced developers can provide.\n\nYes, technology will change how programmers work, but it won\u2019t make them obsolete. AI still needs human oversight. Developers will be the ones verifying data accuracy, fixing errors, and making key decisions about security, ethics, and system design.\n\nSo no, AI is not taking over programming. It's just raising the skill level needed to stay in the game.",

But, unlike the previous, 2023 edition, this year\u2019s report did not say that most technologies, including AI, were expected to be \u201ca net positive\u201d for job numbers.\n\n\u201cAdvances in AI and renewable energy are reshaping the (labor) market \u2014 driving an increase in demand for many technology or specialist roles while driving a decline for others, such as graphic designers,\u201d the WEF said in a press release ahead of its annual meeting in Davos later this month.\n\nSee more\n\nWriting in the wide-ranging report, Saadia Zahidi, the forum\u2019s managing director, highlighted the role of generative AI in reshaping industries and tasks across all sectors.

Close to 70% of companies are planning to hire new workers with skills to design AI tools and enhancements, and 62% intend to recruit more people with skills to better work alongside AI, according to the latest survey, conducted last year.\n\nStriking an optimistic note, the report said the primary impact of technologies such as generative AI on jobs might lie in their potential for \u201caugmenting\u201d human skills through \u201chuman-machine collaboration,\u201d rather than in outright replacement, \u201cparticularly given the continued importance of human-centered skills.\u201d\n\nHowever, many workers have already been replaced by AI.

Although it\u2019s possible that some positions will be replaced entirely by AI, the technology could end up creating new jobs and opportunities for collaboration between AI and humans.\n\nAI at Work Research and insights powering the intersection of AI and business, delivered monthly. Email Leave this field blank\n\nAt the World Economic Forum annual meeting last month in Davos, Switzerland, MIT Sloan professor Danielle Li joined a panel discussion about the opportunities and challenges of using AI to drive efficiency in the workplace. She talked about the need for businesses to define what they think success should look like, invest in data infrastructure, compensate their workers for lending their expertise, and much more.\n\nLi discussed these topics with Aditya Bhasin, Bank of America\u2019s chief technology and information officer; Jim Stratton, the chief technology officer at Workday; and Nitin Mittal, Deloitte\u2019s global AI Leader. The panel was moderated by Andrew Hill, a senior business writer at the Financial Times.\n\nLi, who studies how AI impacts the nature of work, offered four tips for companies experimenting with the technology.\n\nDetermine what AI success should look like at your company.\n\nLarge language models like Claude and ChatGPT are smart and incredibly capable but require training to be useful, Li said. It\u2019s not unlike training a talented employee by giving feedback and guiding them with mentorship. Li said she sees proper model training as a top barrier to further AI adoption.\n\n\u201cHow do we move from an AI that is a genius to one that\u2019s capable within an organization?\u201d she said. One solution is for companies to build out their data infrastructure with lots of clear, labeled examples of what they think a good job looks like.\n\nHow do we move from an AI that\u2019s a genius to one that\u2019s capable within an organization? Danielle Li Professor, MIT Sloan Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America has found success with its AI-powered virtual assistant, Erica, which provides more than 25 million customers a month with services, from conducting transactions to providing insights about how to manage their finances, Bhasin said.\n\nErica is a good example of using internal data to build a model to perform specific tasks, but a lot of companies haven\u2019t invested in the internal infrastructure to make that possible, Li said, adding, \u201cI think that\u2019s a big challenge going forward.\u201d\n\nMake investments in data infrastructure, and pool data across organizations.\n\nMittal, Deloitte\u2019s AI leader, pointed to customer service, software engineering, and R&D assistance as areas where AI is fully stepping into roles normally filled by humans, particularly when it comes to working in call centers, writing coding, and testing software.\n\nLi noted that all three areas have \u201ca tremendous amount of often public, often fully pooled data\u201d that can be used for predictive purposes and to build models and identify patterns.\n\n\u201cI think that a lot of the gains to AI development are going to be slow unless we make concerted investments in data infrastructure and understanding where [we can] get a large enough corpus of examples of people doing their jobs well,\u201d Li said. \u201cYou need examples, and you need those examples labeled properly.\u201d\n\nSmall companies might not have the same amount of in-house data that larger companies do. To compensate, smaller companies might have to buy external data, which might not accurately reflect their expertise.\n\n\u201cI think we need to think about ways of building data infrastructure that allow data to be pooled across organizations that might even be competing with each other,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make progress unless we get some scale.\u201d\n\nIncentivize your workforce to collaborate with AI.\n\nEmployees may object to having their work or data used to train AI models without their consent or compensation. For example, a video recording of a teacher conducting a class may be helpful for students who are unable to attend in real time and want to watch it online later, Li said. In cases where the teacher does a good job, the recording could be added to a repertoire of training videos that could then be used to build models to do the same job. But this diminishes the teacher\u2019s expertise \u2014 why have teachers when you can just watch videos online?\n\n\u201c[Humans are] paid because expertise is rare,\u201d she said. \u201cThe moment your expertise stops being rare, you stop getting paid.\u201d\n\nLi said that companies should incentivize their employees to share their knowledge and work with the technology, or compensate them for doing so. As a result, employees wold be more likely to want to be active stakeholders in the information-sharing process.\n\nDetermine what roles you want AI to be a substitute for, and contemplate what new jobs might be created.\n\nLi said that AI substitution is inevitable for some traditionally human-staffed positions or tasks, but wondered, \u201cIs that a bad thing or not?\u201d Imagine, for instance, a tired radiologist trying to read a patient\u2019s medical results in the middle of the night. In this case, having AI do the task might be the preferred route. \u201cI think there\u2019s a difference between replacing jobs and replacing specific subtasks of roles,\u201d Li said.\n\nTechnology has also created new jobs and tasks, she said, pointing to areas like search engine optimization. \u201cWe have the agency to decide what we want some of those jobs to look like,\u201d Li said.",

        "text": "Even as AI eliminates some jobs, it will create demand for certain jobs, and augment the nature of many other jobs, says skills expert Gog Soon Joo. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nAI will not replace you, but it may well change your job There has been no lack of predictions regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs, but skills expert Gog Soon Joo presents a more nuanced picture of how AI will impact the jobs of Singaporeans.\n\nQ: There are numerous reports that make bold predictions on the number of jobs that will be lost to AI (artificial intelligence). Some of the figures bandied about are alarming. What is the picture like for Singapore?\n\nA: Yes, in time, AI will replace some jobs and tasks. We have to remember that the technology does not need to be as capable as the human worker to have an impact on jobs.\n\nBy simply making a task less labour-intensive, fewer workers will be required. This is in the nature of technology disruptions, and it is something we cannot change or fight as an open economy.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think that it will be a cliff effect. Adoption takes time.\n\nI find studies such as the one done by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory quite insightful. The study, released in January 2024, analysed the majority of jobs that have been previously identified as \u201cexposed\u201d to AI, or at risk of being lost to AI, especially in the realm of computer vision.\n\nThe researchers then looked at the wages paid to workers currently doing these jobs, and calculated how much it might cost to bring on an automated tool instead.\n\nThey ended up finding that a vast majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI in this field are not economically beneficial for employers to automate at this time. For now, it would still make the most economic sense for an employer to continue to pay a worker to do it.\n\nThe other point to remember is that even as AI eliminates some jobs, it will, at the same time, create demand for certain jobs, and augment the nature of many other jobs. The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023 shared that of those they have surveyed, 49 per cent anticipated AI to be a catalyst for job creation, while 23 per cent also expected it to drive job displacement.\n\nThat it takes a while for industries to change is a good thing, as policymakers, employers and workers will have time to prepare and adapt for these coming changes.\n\nQ: So what should workers do to prepare themselves?\n\nA: Some of us will be able and keen to seize the new opportunities offered by AI, for example, in the space of data analytics and data management. This may be a good time to think about preparing and training oneself for the career transition to this new, exciting space.\n\nFor many of us, it is about how current jobs will change in nature. From the data that SSG (SkillsFuture Singapore) pulled from job postings, it is clear that the skill sets required for existing job roles are changing. What workers need are the skills to be a smart user of AI in their current occupation or profession. Domain knowledge, experience and expertise will remain important.\n\nFor example, marketing professionals had to be familiar with marketing on traditional platforms. Then, with the rise of social media, they had to learn how to market on these new platforms. Now, with the rise in the use of AI tools, they need to increasingly learn how AI tools and data can help optimise their marketing dollar to produce successful campaigns.\n\nThe skill sets and experience that they have gathered before, such as understanding their audience, creativity and strategic messaging, remain core. However, if the individual does not upskill, say, in social media marketing and the use of AI tools and apps, he will be less able to generate value for his employer, and also be at a disadvantage in the labour market.\n\nQ: What are the skills that people should acquire to thrive in the age of AI? What are some of the skills that AI cannot replace?\n\nA: Those aiming for jobs in developing AI tools, and those designing solutions using AI tools, will need to build the necessary technical skills.\n\nBut for the rest of us who are using AI as part of our current work, it is about having the skills and attitude to be a smart user. This means, for example, being creative in redesigning workflows, being collaborative in working across user groups and engineering groups, and being curious and adaptable in wanting to discover what tech can or cannot do.\n\nTherefore, soft skills, such as creative thinking, collaboration and adaptability \u2013 these are the kind of skills that AI cannot replace, and they will become even more important in the age of AI.\n\nLet\u2019s take communication skills. Effective communication is the foundation of building professional relationships, both inside and outside the organisation. It is core to nurturing positive relationships and building strong teams. Collaboration and communication are cited as the two major skills gaps by employers.\n\nFinally, to your specific question on skills that AI cannot replace, it is notoriously difficult to automate physical tasks in uncontrolled environments; for example, caring for a child or an elderly person.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how certain professions in the care economy that require a human touch develop. Perhaps, as a society, we may start to value these jobs and tasks more, as no machine can do them well.\n\nQ: What new jobs are being created by AI? Or how will some job roles change with the use of AI?\n\nA: Based on the analysis of LinkedIn Talent Insights data from October 2023, the top fastest-growing AI job roles in Singapore include full-stack engineer, AI engineer and data engineer. Some new work functions have emerged, such as prompt engineering, and training of generative AI chatbot responses.\n\nWe have noticed that skills related to the use of new AI apps and tools, such as classification and regression tree, or Cart, Watson Studio and ImageJ, have emerged.\n\nIncreasingly, we also found that AI apps and tools have increased in relative importance from 2012 to 2022 for finance, information and communications technology, and retail and wholesale trade professionals.\n\nThe recent Jobs-Skills Insights Report by the Institute for Human Resource Professionals and SSG revealed the need for human resources professionals to refresh their digital skill sets. Demand for the skill \u201cAI application\u201d saw an upward trend in HR job postings over the past five years, with a sharp increase from 2021 to 2022.\n\nWe have separately noted through job posting data that AI application is among the top 100 skills in demand, with more than 30,000 job postings between September 2022 and June 2023 requiring this skill.\n\nQ: How are Singaporeans responding to it so far?\n\nA: We are encouraged by some studies that included workers in Singapore.\n\nA LinkedIn study on the Future of Work in August 2023, for example, found that workers in Singapore are the world\u2019s fastest when it comes to adopting AI skills. The report, which drew data from 25 countries, found that Singapore has the highest \u201cdiffusion rate\u201d \u2013 the share of members adding AI skills to their profiles grew 20 times from January 2016.\n\nAnother study \u2013 by KPMG and the University of Queensland \u2013 found that Singaporeans are among the highest users in the world of AI at work, with 68 per cent already doing so.\n\nA further 44 per cent said they are aware that their organisation uses AI. Another 60 per cent of Singaporeans would be willing to trust it at work, and 67 per cent would be comfortable with AI having a greater role in their workplace. They cite improved efficiency and effectiveness, cost benefits, and the innovation it enables as key positive changes AI has made in the workplace.\n\nBut it is not just attitudes that matter. It is how that translates into learning and action. On the ground, we see that prevalent skills among professionals with AI skills include machine learning and python. This means Singaporeans have been picking up and equipping themselves with these skill sets that are increasing in demand.\n\nBut there is clearly no resting on these findings. The key is to remember that jobs in many sectors will change, and they will be augmented by AI. We can ride the wave by learning the tools to make our work more productive and more meaningful.\n\nWe have to keep encouraging Singaporeans to adapt, continue learning and seize the opportunities.\n\nThe Government is doing its part. It recently announced that it will invest more than $1 billion over the next five years in developing AI compute infrastructure, talent and the industry. This is in support of the National AI Strategy 2.0, which was unveiled in December 2023 and is designed to support Singapore\u2019s aim of becoming a global AI leader.\n\nWith Singapore investing significantly in supporting workers and businesses, our workers are well placed to leverage the opportunities that are coming in the age of AI.\n\nAbout Dr Gog Soon Joo\n\nPHOTO: SKILLSFUTURE SINGAPORE\n\nDr Gog Soon Joo is the chief skills officer at SkillsFuture Singapore, and has held a number of posts with the Government.

        "text": "AI is here to amplify your team's skills, not replace them\u2014see how it can drive your growth!\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur United Kingdom, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform industries, entrepreneurs face a pivotal question: will it replace human jobs, or enhance the roles people play in their businesses? Leading experts share their insights on how AI will reshape the workplace, offering valuable perspectives on how entrepreneurs can leverage this technology to empower their teams and drive growth.\n\nDominic Wellington, enterprise architect at SnapLogic; a company pioneering AI-led integration for enterprise, Khyati Sundaram, CEO of ethical AI hiring experts platform, Applied and a LinkedIn Top Voice in the field of ethical AI; Dr. Leslie Kanthan CEO and co-founder at TurinTech, a company that develops and provides AI optimisation products and solutions, and Lauren Murphy, CEO of data consultancy firm Friday Initiatives, all agree that AI will enhance rather than replace human jobs. They emphasise AI's ability to automate tasks, create new roles, and foster collaboration, ultimately amplifying human expertise and driving business growth.\n\nThis optimistic outlook comes at a time when AI is increasingly being integrated into various sectors, from healthcare to finance, and the fear of job displacement remains a common concern. However, experts believe that AI will not replace human creativity, emotional intelligence, or strategic thinking\u2014qualities that are essential in decision-making and leadership. Instead, they argue, AI will serve as a powerful tool, streamlining routine tasks and freeing up valuable time for employees to focus on higher-level responsibilities. For entrepreneurs, this shift presents an opportunity to rethink workforce dynamics, adopt more efficient workflows, and foster a more collaborative environment where human talent and AI work hand-in-hand to drive innovation.\n\nAI's role in automating tasks \u2013 but not replacing people\n\nAI will streamline tasks, but humans will remain essential in the workplace. SnapLogic's Wellington acknowledges that while AI can automate specific tasks within industries, he emphasises that the complete replacement of human workers is unlikely in most roles. He cites examples like Klarna, which claimed to have replaced 700 employees with AI, but contrasts this with the reality that approximately 80% of AI projects fail to deliver tangible benefits. For Wellington, the truth lies in a balanced approach, where AI enhances human capabilities rather than completely replacing them.\n\n\"AI is certainly already capable of automating certain tasks, but very few jobs are made up entirely of such simple tasks,\" he says. \"In most jobs, people perform a variety of different tasks, and even if all of them could be automated, human input is still going to be required to coordinate between the tasks, and importantly, evaluate the results.\"\n\nAccording to Wellington, AI's value lies not in replacing jobs but in enhancing them. By automating specific parts of a job, AI can make employees far more productive. The challenge, however, is ensuring AI is implemented thoughtfully. \"By automating discrete parts of a person's job, AI-enabled tools can make them more productive - potentially, much more productive. The key is to focus on tasks that will actually deliver business benefits. A technology-first approach will almost certainly fail. Instead, user-centric design is required for users to be able to unlock the full benefits of AI,\" he advises.\n\nAI as a tool for ethical innovation\n\nAI is reshaping industries, creating new roles rather than replacing humans. Applied's Sundaram offers a fresh perspective on AI's impact, focusing on its ethical considerations and job creation potential. She emphasises AI's growing presence across industries, while reassuring that it's unlikely to replace humans anytime soon.\n\n\"AI is playing an increasing role in all industries. But we needn't fear that AI will replace humans in the workplace anytime soon,\" Sundaram states. \"This is because we're not yet at a place where AI can or should be trusted to make decisions independently. AI models that aren't trained, monitored, and audited carefully by humans risk amplifying historic biases.\"\n\nFor Sundaram, the key to AI's future is its responsible application. While AI may not replace jobs, it is certainly opening up opportunities in new, evolving roles. \"AI has created ample opportunities for those who want to use ethical models as a tool in new roles, whilst staying vigilant and in control at all times,\" she adds. \"From smart-assisted sports coaches, to tech fashion designers and metaverse architects\u2014the possible list of future AI-enhanced roles is endless.\"\n\nSundaram goes on to say that when it comes to making hiring decisions, the proliferation of AI-assisted CVs and cover letters is already leading many employers, including the UK Government, Unicef UK, and HarperCollins, to switch to fairer and more accurate skills-based recruitment processes.\n\n\"Skills-based hiring starts with anonymous applications that consist of skills-based questions. Ethical AI can help hiring teams make this process even more efficient and objective. Then, additional tests which don't easily lend themselves to ChatGPT use - like cognitive ability tests and numerical aptitude tests - can be used to further filter for top talent. For candidates, this will create more opportunities to demonstrate their skills in areas they excel in, and find roles which they will genuinely be able to thrive in. For employers, it will separate out true talent from tech,\" she says.\n\nCollaboration is key\n\nAI will transform jobs by handling routine tasks, empowering employees to focus on creativity and innovation. Dr. Kanthan, CEO and co-founder of TurinTech, agrees that AI will not replace human jobs but will undoubtedly transform them. He envisions AI taking over repetitive and time-intensive tasks, freeing employees to focus on higher-value work, such as strategy, creativity, and innovation.\n\n\"Businesses will see AI take over repetitive and time-intensive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value work like strategy, creativity, and innovation,\" Kanthan explains. \"However, the most effective AI systems will be those that collaborate with human expertise.\"\n\nHe highlights that businesses combining AI with Human Intelligence (HI) through feedback loops, collaboration, and validation achieve far better results than those relying solely on AI. He points out that this collaboration ensures that AI-driven outputs are not only aligned with business goals but also enriched by human insights that AI cannot replicate, such as ethical considerations, creative vision, and contextual understanding. Kanthan goes on to say that businesses that integrate AI into their decision-making processes need to ensure that AI outputs are transparent and validated.\n\n\"Customers want to trust the decisions and recommendations AI makes on their behalf, whether it's suggesting a new product, automating a process, or optimising their experience. Companies that prioritise AI accountability and collaboration will build this trust while leveraging AI to create more meaningful customer interactions.\"\n\nEnhancing expertise and empowering human insight\n\nAI is key to unlocking experts' potential according to Lauren Murphy. The Friday Initiatives' CEO echoes the belief that AI will enhance human roles rather than replace them.\n\n\"AI will continue to reshape our operations, and those of our clients, by maximising the value of data, automating complex governance processes, and driving innovation across our services. We envision AI becoming even more integral to decision-making, enabling faster, more accurate, analysis while freeing up our experts to focus on nuanced legal, communication, and strategy questions.\"\n\nMurphy explains that AI excels at handling repetitive, data-heavy tasks, allowing experts to dedicate their time to complex challenges that require human insight.\n\n\"We firmly believe AI will enhance rather than replace human roles. AI takes on repetitive, data-heavy tasks, allowing our experts to focus on complex issues requiring human expertise,\" Murphy says. \"The future of governance and compliance is rooted in human-AI collaboration, where technology complements and empowers human insight.\"\n\nFor Murphy, the collaboration between AI and HI is critical to the future of industries like governance, compliance, and beyond. AI's potential lies in its ability to augment human decision-making, helping experts navigate complex scenarios with data-driven insights while retaining the need for human oversight and judgment. However, she emphasises the importance of balancing AI's transformative potential with careful use.\n\n\"Balancing transformative capabilities with responsible implementation ensures trustworthy solutions. With AI, as the old adage goes - rubbish in, rubbish out. So we're focused on creating trusted data via dynamic mapping, getting our clients fighting fit to make the most out of AI.\"\n\nThe consensus from these industry leaders is clear: AI is unlikely to replace human jobs entirely. Instead, it will enhance and transform the roles people play in various industries. Whether through streamlining repetitive tasks, creating new ethical positions, or fostering collaboration between human expertise and AI capabilities, the future of work will depend on a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. Far from replacing jobs, AI has the potential to create new ones, particularly in fields where human judgment, creativity, and emotional intelligence remain irreplaceable.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, the focus must remain on ensuring that technology compliments human abilities, enabling professionals to focus on high-value, creative, and strategic work. Through thoughtful implementation and ethical considerations, AI can be harnessed to drive innovation and productivity, without diminishing the importance of human oversight. The key will be in striking the right balance - embedding AI into the workplace in a way that empowers workers, while safeguarding the human-centric aspects of work that technology cannot replicate. In this way, AI has the potential to enhance efficiency while fostering a new era of collaboration, where technology and human talent work together, not against each other. The big question then is, what exciting opportunities lie ahead for businesses that harness the power of both human and artificial intelligence?",

        "text": "Last month, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski boasted that he hadn't hired anyone in a year as a result of his company embracing AI.\n\nKlarna's workforce had shrunk by about 22 percent since doubling down roughly a year ago. Meanwhile, the company has amassed a valuation of well over $14 billion, in what Siemiatkowski frames as a financially successful bid to cash in on the hype surrounding AI.\n\nThe fintech company, which offers \"buy now, pay later\" services for the e-commerce industry, made a big fuss about its OpenAI ChatGPT integration, gushing that its AI assistant could do the work of \"700 full-time agents\" in a February press release.\n\nBut that kind of purportedly superhuman productivity could have dire consequences for the job security of practically anybody at the company \u2014 including its CEO, as it turns out.\n\nThat's something experts have long warned could be a possibility in the age of AI automation. In simple terms, it's not just low-level grunt work that's on the chopping block: high-level executives could equally be made redundant by genuinely clever AI.\n\n\"To me AI is capable of doing all our jobs, my own included,\" Siemiatkowski wrote in a lengthy tweet on Sunday.\n\n\"Because our work is simply reasoning combined with knowledge/experience,\" he argued. \"And the most critical breakthrough, reasoning, is behind us.\"\n\nBut being out of a job because of your own commitment to AI is something that Siemiatkowski is \"not super excited\" about.\n\n\"My work to me is a super important part of who I am, and realizing it might become unnecessary is gloomy,\" he wrote. \"But I also believe we need to be honest with what we think will happen. And I [would] rather learn and explore than pretend it does not exist.\"\n\nResearchers have already studied the possibility of CEOs becoming an endangered species in the age of AI.\n\n\"My first instinct is they would say, 'Replace all the employees but not me,'\" former director of MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab Anant Agarwal told The New York Times last year. \"But I thought more deeply and would say 80 percent of the work that a CEO does can be replaced by AI.\"\n\nBeyond a gleeful sense of justice felt by low-level employees everywhere, ditching CEOs could also free up considerable funds. The average CEO makes around $16 million, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) \u2014 and that's without getting into the incompetence of many top-level executives.\n\nIn a December interview with Bloomberg, Siemiatkowski claimed that roughly 200 Klarna employees were using AI for their core work.\n\nAnd the CEO is egging them on, even promising them a bigger payout.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to give some of the improvements that the efficiency that AI provides by increasing the pace at which the salaries of our employees increases,\" he told the outlet.\n\nSiemiatkowski also argued that he was happy to take up president-elect Donald Trump's offer to receive \"fully expedited approvals and permits\" for investing $1 billion in the US.\n\nFor now, AI taking over the job of a C-suiter \u2014 or virtually anyone doing any serious work, regardless of Siemiatkowski's claims \u2014 remains far-fetched. As of right now, the technology still suffers from frequent \"hallucinations\" and struggles with basic reasoning tasks.\n\n\"The idea of AI performing every human job, including that of a CEO, still remains more speculative than realistic at this point,\" AI avatar company Genies CEO Akash Nigam told Fortune. The \"CEO\u2019s role requires not just strategic thinking but probably more importantly, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and nuanced leadership \u2014 qualities that AI cannot fully replicate yet.\"\n\nAnd the many shortcomings of AI haven't flown over the head of Siemiatkowski either.\n\n\"However, how exactly we will combine those building blocks of reason and knowledge to replicate the work we do today is not yet entirely solved,\" he admitted in his Sunday tweet.\n\n\"Exactly how long it will take for the world to figure this out, who knows for sure?\" he added. \"But I think we can all agree it is not in the 100s of years.\"\n\nMore on replacing CEOs with AI: CEO Says He Hasn't Hired Anyone in a Year as He Replaces Human Workers With AI",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of the workforce, and according to Bill Gates, this is just the beginning. The Microsoft co-founder believes AI will eliminate most jobs and radically transform the global economy. But here\u2019s the good news\u2014three professions seem immune to this technological shake-up\u2026 at least for now.\n\nAI Could Reduce the Workweek to Three Days\n\nImagine a world where you only work three days a week. Sounds like a dream, right? According to Gates, this could become reality as AI automates a massive chunk of today\u2019s jobs. The 40-hour workweek? It could soon be history.\n\nBut not everyone will benefit. As AI takes over routine tasks, millions of jobs could disappear. The challenge will be adapting before it\u2019s too late.\n\nStill, Gates identifies three professions that should survive this AI-driven revolution. If you work in one of these fields, you might just be safe.\n\n1. Coders: AI Still Needs Its Creators\n\nYou\u2019d think programmers would be the first to go, right? AI can already generate code, so what\u2019s left for humans to do? A lot, actually.\n\nWhile AI is impressive, it still makes mistakes\u2014sometimes big ones. Human programmers are needed to correct errors, refine algorithms, and push AI development forward. In short, AI needs humans\u2026 to create AI.\n\nSo if you\u2019re in tech, don\u2019t panic just yet. Your expertise isn\u2019t obsolete\u2014it\u2019s more valuable than ever.\n\n2. Energy Experts: Too Complex for Automation\n\nFrom nuclear power to renewable energy, this industry is too critical to be left entirely to machines. Engineers, researchers, and technicians play a crucial role in managing infrastructure, making strategic decisions, and ensuring safety.\n\nThink about it\u2014would you trust an AI to run an entire power grid alone? Probably not. Human oversight is still non-negotiable in the energy sector.\n\n3. Biologists: But There\u2019s a Catch\u2026\n\nAI is already diagnosing diseases, analyzing DNA, and even outperforming doctors in some areas. So why does Gates believe biology will survive the AI revolution?\n\nBecause the problem isn\u2019t AI\u2014it\u2019s demand. Funding for biology research is limited, and breakthroughs require human intuition and creativity. While AI can process data, it still lacks the ability to drive innovation in the same way scientists do.\n\nThat said, biologists will need to evolve\u2014working alongside AI rather than competing with it.\n\nThe Future of Work: Adapt or Disappear\n\nEven Gates admits he could be wrong. AI is evolving so quickly that predicting the job market in ten years is like predicting the internet before Google.\n\nOne thing is certain: AI is here to stay. The smartest move? Learning to work with AI instead of fearing it. And for those outside these \u201csafe\u201d fields? It might be time to rethink career plans.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next? AI Beyond Imagination\n\nGates isn\u2019t just thinking about today\u2019s AI, like ChatGPT. He sees something bigger ahead\u2014a self-aware AI that can think, learn, and improve like a human.\n\nAn AI that could make us smarter, more efficient, even immortal. Science fiction? Or an imminent reality?\n\nUntil we know for sure, one thing is clear\u2014AI is changing everything. The real question is:\n\nAre you in one of the safe jobs, or is it time for a career upgrade?",

Rather, AI is likely to become integrated into many more aspects of our work in the next decade, particularly in the fields of finance, healthcare, education and entertainment.\n\nFor example, the most common form of AI today is large language models (LLMs) \u2013 computational models trained on vast amounts of data to perform basic tasks, such as ChatGPT and Claude. However, there are still many instances of these models producing errors or \u201challucinations,\u201d which are false perceptions by the AI presented as facts.\n\nAtelier Shen, head of product at The Business Times (and our resident tech aficionado), says that AI isn\u2019t quite there yet.\n\n\u201c(LLMs in particular) excel in conversation and specific tasks like customer service or content summarisation, but aren\u2019t yet capable of replacing end-to-end human work or decision-making roles, in my view,\u201d he adds.\n\nSince AI can\u2019t be held accountable for errors, there is still demand for human work to check and process data and information, as well as for roles that involve managing the AI, say industry watchers.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility of managing AI and its outcomes still lies with humans, ensuring that AI complements rather than replaces human jobs,\u201d Shen says.\n\nHis work in the BT newsroom, for example, focuses more on automating tasks to help staff, rather than to replace them. The main aim of his efforts is to use technology to simplify tedious jobs such as text formatting and information collection.\n\nA study by the Harvard Business School conducted with consultants at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that staff who were assisted by AI produced work assessed to be 40 per cent higher in quality.\n\nHowever, those consultants assisted by AI still missed certain subtleties when analysing quantitative evidence from qualitative materials. This is where the human element of experience and subject matter expertise shows its value. Workers who know how to use AI as a tool have the most to gain, as they can bring their work to the next level.\n\n\ud83d\udc7d Must we join the AI rat race?\n\nWhether AI will replace us or not, many people in Singapore don\u2019t want to be left behind, especially when one\u2019s career is at stake. Nearly 74 per cent of workers here express concern regarding AI job redundancy as compared to 60 per cent of employees globally, according to a survey by consultancy Oliver Wyman.\n\nAnother study by professional services firm KPMG notes that the supply of skilled technology and AI talent is still limited at a global level, with around 30 per cent to 70 per cent of data, security and development job postings unfilled.\n\nBut must we all rush to become AI engineers or scientists, just because this technology is taking off now?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably more practical for the average person like you and me to focus on applying AI in our daily lives, rather than hyper-focusing on learning certain technical aspects (for the sake of it),\u201d Shen says. \u201cThe former alone can be quite remarkable.\u201d\n\nStill want to keep up with the AI hype? Here are some easy things to do to get you started \ud83d\udc63:\n\nStart experimenting with ChatGPT and other AI tools in your own personal life first: You can try sending simple prompts to generate an itinerary for your upcoming four-day trip to Phuket or suggest creative ideas for a friend\u2019s birthday celebration. Once you become more familiar with these tools, you can move on to explore other coding sites such as Python or GitHub to see what else you can build online for yourself!\n\nPractice using different AI and data management tools at work: There\u2019s nothing like hands-on learning. See how each update of ChatGPT can better organise your research for work, or try using these tools to build something that can improve your work quality. If you\u2019re feeling confident and ambitious, volunteer to helm a project at work using AI to help your team.\n\nJoin professional AI-related interest groups: This could help you engage with professional organisations and online communities related to AI and technology. Such groups on messaging apps or social media platforms can also be helpful for keeping updated on what\u2019s developing in the AI space.\n\nListen in to AI talks and participate in community events: AI webinars can be a quick and easy way to get in some learning of the industry for you in an hour or two after work. For those who wish to go the extra mile in understanding the industry, participating in conferences or local meetups to network with professionals can help you learn about the latest industry trends.\n\nWhether or not AI will come for your job, it makes sense to learn more about the tools you could well be working with in the days to come \ud83d\udc7e. That way, you\u2019ll be better prepared for what the future will bring.\n\nTL;DR",

        "text": "The rise of artificial intelligence has triggered concerns about job losses, but evidence suggests AI is reshaping work rather than eliminating it. AI, if not smarter, is undeniably faster, leading to widespread fears of automation taking over human roles. However, research and industry experts argue that AI is here to complement human labour, not replace it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the AI Action Summit in France, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, \u201cWe are at the dawn of the AI age that will shape the course of humanity.\u201d His remarks reflect the global push toward AI integration while acknowledging the anxiety surrounding its impact on jobs.\n\nCarolin Blais from MIT School of Engineering questioned AI\u2019s creative limitations, asking, \u201cScientists in Germany have trained computers to paint in the style of Van Gogh and Picasso, and the computers\u2019 images aren\u2019t all that bad. But, is teaching a machine to mimic creativity true creativity?\u201d This highlights a fundamental distinction\u2014AI can replicate tasks, but true creativity remains human-led.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA McKinsey Digital report\u2014Superagency in the Workplace: Empowering People to Unlock AI\u2019s Full Potential\u2014revealed that employees are adopting AI tools faster than their leaders realise. It found that three times more employees use generative AI for a third or more of their work than managers expect. The report valued AI\u2019s long-term productivity impact at $4.4 trillion and noted, \u201cA.I. now is like the internet many years ago: The risk for business leaders is not thinking too big, but rather too small.\u201d\n\nMcKinsey\u2019s research also found that 92% of companies plan to increase their AI investments over the next three years. The shift isn\u2019t just about automation\u2014it\u2019s about using AI to enhance productivity, streamline workflows, and unlock new business opportunities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe International Monetary Fund echoed this in its paper Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work, stating, \u201cIf A.I. strongly complements human labor in certain occupations and the productivity gains are sufficiently large, higher growth and labor demand could more than compensate for the partial replacement of labor tasks by A.I., and incomes could increase along most of the income distribution.\u201d AI-related skills, including proficiency in tools like ChatGPT, are now in demand across industries.\n\nAt Davos 2025, Nara Lokesh, Minister for Human Resource Development, IT, Electronics & Communications, and Real-Time Governance, Government of Andhra Pradesh, told NDTV, \u201cAI will not reduce jobs but it will instead reduce the order of jobs.\u201d He said new roles will emerge in areas yet to be explored, and integrating AI into education and workforce training can drive economic growth.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, AI\u2019s adoption is not without consequences. Studies suggest that higher-wage earners stand to benefit more, potentially widening income inequality. Developed economies, with their focus on cognitive-task-oriented jobs and advanced digital infrastructure, are better positioned to leverage AI\u2019s potential than emerging markets.\n\nIndia is actively working to integrate AI into its economy. The government allocated Rs 500 crore in this year\u2019s budget for a Centre of Excellence in AI for education. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who had once dismissed India\u2019s AI progress as \u201chopeless,\u201d recently acknowledged the country\u2019s rapid advancements and its push for an indigenous AI model.\n\nDespite concerns over automation, AI is expected to create opportunities in energy, healthcare, and financial services, according to Nigel Vaz, CEO of Publicis Sapient. \u201cAI is going to be embedded in every single aspect of transformation. We are moving from human action-driven processes to more agentic architectures, where digital and physical workforces operate together,\u201d Vaz told NDTV at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He said AI would take over repetitive tasks, freeing workers to focus on higher-value roles.\n\nVaz also highlighted a shift from software as a service to services as software, where AI platforms generate software dynamically based on real-time needs. \u201cSoftware is now able to create opportunities in the services space, producing outcomes that were previously unattainable. Companies are moving from deploying software products to creating AI-driven platforms that generate software on demand,\u201d he said.\n\nAI is changing the nature of work. It is not about machines replacing humans but about humans learning to work alongside them. The challenge lies not in stopping AI but in adapting to its inevitable integration.",

        "text": "Johnny C. Taylor Jr.\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr. tackles your human resources questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society and author of \"Reset: A Leader\u2019s Guide to Work in an Age of Upheaval.\u201d\n\nHave a question? Submit it here.\n\nQuestion: One of the smaller groups in our organization has been using artificial intelligence for some of their work. Should we be concerned that AI will replace jobs as we expand the usage of it? \u2012 Kima\n\nAnswer: It\u2019s natural to feel concerned about the potential impact of AI on jobs, especially as its adoption grows in your organization. You\u2019re not alone in these worries: Recent research shows that about one-quarter of U.S. workers are apprehensive about automation potentially supplanting their jobs in the near future. However, while AI will undoubtedly transform certain roles, it\u2019s also poised to create new opportunities and enhance our work.\n\nThink of AI not as a replacement for human intelligence but as a tool to amplify it. AI excels at processing vast amounts of data, automating repetitive tasks, and improving efficiency, but it can't replicate the creativity, empathy, or nuanced decision-making humans bring to the workplace. The \u201chuman element\u201d will always be essential because our work ultimately serves people.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can approach this evolving landscape with confidence and resilience:\n\n\u25fe Embrace AI as a partner. Rather than viewing AI as a threat, consider how it can augment your abilities. AI can take over mundane tasks, freeing you to focus on your work\u2019s strategic, creative, or interpersonal aspects.\n\n\u25fe Upskill and adapt. Continuously learning and growing your skill set is key to staying relevant in a rapidly changing world. Take courses, attend training sessions, or participate in professional development opportunities, especially those teaching how to work alongside AI or apply it to your field.\n\n\u25fe Demonstrate value. Take on new challenges, be proactive in problem-solving, and consistently exceed expectations. Look for ways to integrate AI into your role to drive efficiency and productivity.\n\n\u25fe Collaborate and innovate. Discuss with your manager how AI can enhance your team\u2019s performance and explore how to leverage it to serve customers or clients better. Sharing ideas and demonstrating initiative can position you as a forward-thinking leader in your organization.\n\n\u25fe Prepare for the future. Careers are no longer static, and neither should our skill sets be. As new technology creates demand for roles such as AI monitoring, management, and ethical oversight, consider how you can align your expertise with these emerging opportunities.\n\nI\u2019ll add this: AI in and of itself is not the most significant threat to workers. Other workers who know how to use AI are the more likely threat to your jobs. Employers favor workers with AI acumen to facilitate their advancement. AI needs human input and oversight to be effective. So, developing your AI skill set is the best way to ensure your career. We can choose to run from it and limit our opportunities and growth or embrace it to expand our potential.\n\nMake no mistake, AI is here to stay and now is the time to focus on harnessing its potential to enhance our productivity, performance, and possibilities. By proactively engaging with this technology, you position yourself to not just survive but thrive in an AI-augmented workplace.\n\nI was laid off while on FMLA leave. Isn\u2019t FMLA supposed to protect workers with personal medical challenges? Do I have any recourse to fight the layoff or receive compensation? \u2012 Pamela\n\nI\u2019m so sorry to hear about your situation. The Family and Medical Leave Act is, indeed, designed to protect employees facing personal or family medical challenges by granting up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave. However, it\u2019s important to understand that while FMLA offers job protection, it does not guarantee immunity from layoffs or terminations if those actions are unrelated to the leave itself.\n\nUnder FMLA regulations, an employee on leave has no greater right to reinstatement or job security than they would have if they were continuously employed during that time. This means that if your employer can demonstrate the layoff was part of a broader, legitimate business decision and not influenced by your leave, they may be within their legal rights. For example, if your position was eliminated companywide or due to a restructuring unrelated to your medical leave, the employer might have grounds for the action.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take:\n\n\u25fe Review the documentation. Carefully examine any layoff notices, severance offers, or exit paperwork provided. Look for details about the reasons for the layoff and whether it also impacted other employees.\n\n\u25fe Contact HR. Reach out to your former employer\u2019s HR department for clarification on the criteria used for the layoff. Ask for transparency about how your position was selected for termination while you were on leave.\n\n\u25fe Seek legal guidance. Consulting with an employment attorney may be worthwhile if you suspect your FMLA leave influenced the layoff decision. An attorney can assess whether the employer violated your rights and advise on potential recourse, such as filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or pursuing legal action.\n\n\u25fe Explore additional compensation. Some employers offer severance packages as part of layoffs. Review any severance agreement closely and consult a legal professional before signing, especially if you\u2019re uncertain about its terms.\n\nWhile losing a job during a challenging time is undoubtedly difficult, understanding your rights and options can help you navigate the situation more effectively. I hope you can find clarity and support in addressing this matter and that your health continues to improve.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this column are the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of USA TODAY.\n\nLeaning on HR: How to establish structured employee policies and systems in a company: Ask HR",

While AI offers numerous benefits as an innovation, it also poses potential negative impacts, particularly in replacing certain jobs with machines and robots.\n\nThis shift creates a gap between workers\u2019 skills and the skills required by the job market.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Microeconomics Dashboard (Micdash) team at the Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Gadjah Mada (FEB UGM), the use of AI is steadily increasing.\n\nThis technology is expected to significantly impact the job market by simplifying information retrieval and enhancing human resource management, particularly in increasing productivity and monitoring worker activities.\n\nDr. Qisha Quarina, coordinator of Micdash\u2019s studies, revealed that 77% of people remain concerned about AI\u2019s potential to eliminate jobs and replace human tasks.\n\nHowever, she emphasized that AI can optimize work and complement human resource shortages.\n\n\u201cThis situation understandably raises concerns about work processes being increasingly replaced by machines and robots,\u201d she explained during the release of a new study titled Labor and Technology Economics: Will Artificial Intelligence Fully Substitute Humans? held at FEB UGM on Friday, Dec. 6, 2024.\n\nShe further noted that AI technology is less effective in unpredictable areas, especially outside predefined fields of knowledge.\n\nThus, she suggested that the education sector and companies provide resources for skill upgrading and reskilling to help workers remain competitive in a rapidly digitizing job market.\n\nAnother Micdash researcher, Raniah Salsabila, highlighted that AI adoption in the labor market is unavoidable, as the technology is fundamentally designed to assist humans in completing tasks and boosting productivity.\n\nFor example, tools like ChatGPT support research, text editing, and efficient idea generation.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates that AI doesn\u2019t simply replace humans but rather replaces specific skills required by workers to make tasks more efficient,\u201d Salsabila explained.\n\nShe added that leveraging AI enables workers to adapt to technological advancements.\n\nIn the future, necessary skills will involve not only technological expertise but also human intelligence capabilities, such as analytical thinking and innovation, complex problem-solving, critical thinking and analysis, creativity, originality and initiative, reasoning, problem-solving, and ideation.\n\n\u201cThese skills are becoming increasingly important.

The company said that using A.I. tools had cut back on the time that its in-house lawyers spend generating standard contracts \u2014 to about 10 minutes from an hour \u2014 and that its communications staff uses the technology to classify press coverage as positive or negative. Klarna has said that the company\u2019s chatbot does the work of 700 customer service agents and that the bot resolves cases an average of nine minutes faster than humans (under two minutes versus 11).\n\nMr. Siemiatkowski and his team went so far as to rig up an A.I. version of him to announce the company\u2019s third-quarter results last year \u2014 to show that even the C.E.O.\u2019s job isn\u2019t safe from automation.\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Siemiatkowski has made clear he doesn\u2019t believe the technology will simply free up workers to focus on more interesting tasks. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s going to be new jobs,\u2019\u201d he said on a podcast last summer, before citing the thousands of professional translators whom A.I. is rapidly making superfluous. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy to say to a 55-year-old translator, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re going to become a YouTube influencer.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Krishna, the IBM chief executive, once turned heads when he said A.I. could prompt the company to slow or pause hiring for the roughly 10 percent of its jobs involving back-office roles like human resources.",

        "text": "IBM's plan to replace thousands of roles with AI presently looks more like outsourcing jobs to India, at the expense of organizational competency.\n\nThat view of Big Blue was offered to The Register after our report on the IT giant's latest layoffs, which resonated so strongly with several IBM employees that they contacted The Register with thoughts on the job cuts.\n\nOur sources have asked not to be identified to protect their ongoing relationships with Big Blue. Suffice to say they were or are employed as senior technologists in business units that span multiple locations and were privy to company communications: These are not views from the narrow entrance to a single cubicle.\n\nWe\u2019re going to refer to three by the pseudonyms Alex, Blake, and Casey.\n\n\"I always make this joke about IBM,\" said Alex. \"It is: 'IBM doesn't want people to work for them.' Every six months or so they are doing rounds of [Resource Actions \u2013 IBM-speak for layoffs] or forcing folks into impossible moves, which result in separation.\"\n\nThat's consistent with CEO Arvind Krishna's commitment last year to replace around 7,800 jobs with AI.\n\nBut our sources say Krishna\u2019s plan is on shaky ground: IBM\u2019s AI isn\u2019t up to the job of replacing people, and some of the people who could fix that have been let go.\n\nAlex observed that over the past four years, IBM management has constantly pushed for automation and the use of AI.\n\n\"With AI tools writing that code for us ... why pay for senior-level staff when you can promote a youngster who doesn't really know any better at a much lower price?\" he said. \"Plus, once you have a seasoned programmer write code that is by law the company's IP and it is fed into an AI library, it basically learns it and the author is no longer needed.\"\n\nBut our sources tell us that scenario has yet to be realized inside IBM.\n\nThe truth is that Watsonx isn\u2019t even available to employees. It's so far behind OpenAI and ChatGPT\n\n\"The whole outsourced to AI thing is a myth that somehow our upper echelon of execs believes exists right now,\u201d Casey told The Register. \"The truth is that Watsonx [IBM\u2019s generative AI offering] isn\u2019t even available to employees to attempt to try and help automate some meaningless task. It's so far behind OpenAI and ChatGPT that it\u2019s not even close.\"\n\n\"A WatsonX chatbot is years behind ChatGPT,\" Blake said. \"Its web interface was horribly broken to the point of being unusable until July 2024, and no one in the entire organization uses it.\u201d\n\n\"Watsonx Code Assistant technically knows PHP, but it is very inferior to GitHub Copilot,\u201d Blake told The Register. \u201cStill, it's better than nothing. The CEO keeps imploring developers to use it. No one does, except maybe one or two people.\"\n\nBig Blue\u2019s developers have little experience with other code assistants, or even ChatGPT, thanks to an internal ban on using externally sourced LLMs, Blake added. He rated IBM developers\u2019 knowledge of LLMs as likely \u201csubstantially less than at other major tech firms.\u201d\n\nWe're told that in IBM Cloud Legacy (formerly SoftLayer), only around one percent of developers who work on the product deal with AI and LLMs.\n\nHollowed out\n\nYet by getting rid of experienced technical staff, IBM is making itself dependent on the very technology that eludes it.\n\nBlake argues that IBM's focus on cutting experienced senior staff \u2013 those who are well-paid and close to retirement \u2013 is an act of self-harm because fewer developers, in his experience, are entering the job market.\n\n\"Senior software engineers stopped being developed in the US around 2012,\" Blake said. \"That\u2019s the real story. No country on Earth is producing new coders faster than old ones retire. India and Brazil were the last countries and both stopped growing new devs circa 2023. China stopped growing new devs in 2020.\"\n\nBlake pointed to Stack Overflow's developer survey data to support the contention that the average age of software developers is rising and the proportion of those with junior-level experience (zero to four years) is shrinking. That's a concern in the open source community too. Tech companies slowing down hiring, and laying tens of thousands off in the US, isn't helping grow the number of coders, either.\n\n\"If it weren't for LLMs, there would be a serious lack of programmers in the next five years as Gen Xers started retiring,\" said Blake. \"I had planned on coding 'til the day I died, but now I think I\u2019ll be talking to LLMs primarily instead.\"\n\nBut at IBM, he fears the LLMs aren\u2019t ready to pick up the slack.\n\nCasey told us that accessing automation tools is also hard. He recounted asking other teams for their scripts. Code was finally provided, but it was still necessary to open tickets manually in the workflow platform ServiceNow.\n\nAncient code and offshore angst\n\nSome of IBM\u2019s infrastructure is not in great shape, Casey told us.\n\n\u201cOur network firmware code is so out of date. We're talking stuff that was [end-of-life] in 2020, that even the vendors have stopped supporting,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were lots of meetings between the way-higher-ups and Cisco, Arista and Juniper. I don't know what deals were made but the vendors ended up providing full support for code that was EOL. The whole network is basically hung together by duct tape and hope.\"\n\nIBM tried to keep things ticking over by hiring network engineering contractors in India, but that didn\u2019t pan out, we're told.\n\nThe whole network is basically hung together by duct tape and hope\n\nThe contractors were supposed to handle basic network maintenance tasks so the senior engineers would be free to work on more impactful projects like upgrading firmware across datacenters. But the contractors were bad and were let go around eighteen months back.\n\n\"Since then they have not hired anyone,\" said Casey, noting that six years went by without a US-based full-time engineer being hired. \"But they continued to cut staff yearly. Even as management begged them that we couldn't lose any more people.\"\n\nWe're told US-based network engineering staff will be reduced to two or three employees per shift during US business hours, representing a 33 percent loss of staff per shift. That's monitoring and maintaining all of IBM\u2019s global datacenters. The EMEA and APAC teams remain at full strength - at least on the networking team \u2013 with five to eight workers on each shift.\n\nWorkers in the situations faced by Alex, Blake, and Casey are unlikely to be in the mood to offer a rosy view of their employer.\n\nBut at IBM, forming a rosy view may be even harder because Krishna's stated plan to replace people with AI appears not to have had the desired impact.\n\nIBM told The Register that despite taking a $400 million workforce rebalancing charge reflecting the loss of \"a very low single digit percentage of IBM\u2019s global workforce,\" the company still expects to end the year \"at roughly the same level of employment as we entered with.\"\n\nIn the opinion of the IBMers we spoke with, it's not AI replacing jobs but cheaper employees who join an org that can\u2019t walk the talk and doesn\u2019t have the tech or the plan to turn things around. \u00ae",

While some jobs will vanish due to AI, this shift will likely create new roles and industries. The real challenge isn\u2019t avoiding change \u2014 it\u2019s adapting to it like we always have.\n\n\u2014 Robert, West Chicago Community High School\n\nMany students discussed A.I.\u2019s role in creative fields. Some argued that the technology will never be able to replace human-made art \u2026\n\nI think people would be highly upset if they found out that actors are being fired in place of AI.\n\nAlthough AI may be able to replace the actors\u2019 voices enough to replicate their character, it could not replace the actors\u2019 personalities being intertwined with the character they play. There will definitely be a clear difference because the AI will feel less human. The film \u201clate night with the devil\u201d received massive controversy for including AI in their props. If a film gets massive controversy for having an AI poster in the background of their film, people would definitely be upset if they found out the actors and actresses that they love are being replaced with soulless technology.\n\n\u2014 Lyric, Maury High School, Norfolk, VA\n\nI would not enjoy a TV show made using A.I. content, because that same A.I. took someone\u2019s job. There\u2019s nothing human looking or sounding about A.I. content either. Everything about A.I. voices sounds so fake, and A.I. arts lack the human flaws and style that makes it truly art. If I\u2019m being honest, it disgusts me when a creator of a media would rather use free A.I. when they have the funds to not do so. There are talented people out there that could make something infinitely better than whatever an A.I. can make, and need the money from these jobs to make a living.\n\n\u2014 Rinoa, NC\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that A.I technologies will be able to replace most of the jobs in the future but not in arts \u2026 Nowadays, people are amazed about A.I made literature pieces or music and say that they would eventually replace all of the authors and composers. Although part of this claim is valid, it would be impossible for A.I.s to replace human artists since they are just copying man-made pieces, not creating their original ones. The system of those A.I.s is much simpler than what people usually think. A.I.s just analyze countless actual songs or writings and find several patterns in there. Then apply those patterns into its work. This means that A.I.s won\u2019t produce diverse workings and will keep generating the same things unless humans keep publishing their original pieces and educating them. Therefore, if all of the music composers and authors around the world don\u2019t get demotivated by this rapid development of A.I.s and keep making their own unique works, humans won\u2019t lose against A.I.s in arts.\n\n\u2014 Brian, South Korea\n\n\u2026 But others worried it eventually could.\n\nWhile I agree that AI will never be able to truly create art as well as a human can, I fear that it will only become harder to distinguish the difference between the two \u2014 to the point that people won\u2019t care about the difference. AI is rapidly improving and even now, it is getting hard to tell the difference between what is AI and what is not. Teachers have to use AI detectors to ensure that a student\u2019s work is their own, and AI generated photos have become so intricate that they can pass as real. Moreover, AI is faster, and it costs a fraction of the price of human work. I strongly believe that this is a cause for much concern and voice actors like Azaria are rightfully worried.",

Building artificial intelligence tech could be a safe option.\n\nThe market for jobs in the AI sector has surged in the last two years, according to a recent analysis from the University of Maryland and job-tracking firm LinkUp \ufeff\u2014 the latest in a slew of studies indicating AI skills are in high demand.\n\nAnil Gupta, a professor of strategy, globalization and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland\u2019s Smith School of Business who co-led the research, said the analysis showed a clear \u201cChatGPT effect,\u201d referring to how the OpenAI-developed chatbot\u2019s launch led to the job posting spike \u2013 replacing many IT-related job listings.\n\nSee more\n\nThe analysis comes from AIMaps, a collaboration between the University of Maryland\u2019s Smith School of Business and LinkUp. The program tracks the growth of AI jobs across different sectors in the United States, such as manufacturing and retail.\n\nJob postings in AI fields have spiked 68% in the United States since the end of 2022, while overall job postings have declined 17% in the same period, according to the AIMaps data. According to ZipRecruiter data provided to CNN, AI job postings on the site grew 124% from 2023 to the end of 2024.\n\nIn January, LinkedIn listed AI engineer and AI consultant as the fastest-growing jobs in the US, and PwC found last year that jobs requiring AI skills were growing more than three times as fast as all jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, IT job postings (including those that write programs not related to AI) have also declined 27% since the end of 2022, according to Gupta.\n\nWhile AI has resulted in some new types of jobs, tech giants have also slashed their workforces after announcing major investments in AI technology \u2014 though not all the layoffs were because AI replaced human workers. Last year, Google laid off workers across its Google Assistant and hardware divisions a few months after announcing a multibillion dollar investment in the AI startup Anthropic. And a World Economic Forum survey last month found that 41% of employers intend to downsize their workforce in favor of AI by 2030.\n\n\u201cWe already know GitHub Copilot and other AI tools are able to do 60-70% of the coding,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cFour people can do the job of 10.\u201d\n\nAI on the rise\n\nThe global AI race is only getting started, as evidenced by the recent release of DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that shook the market with an AI model reportedly developed at a fraction of the cost of American competitors like ChatGPT.\n\nGupta said DeepSeek\u2019s open-source approach \u2014 meaning its architecture is publicly available for other companies to use and adapt \u2014 could accelerate the AI industry\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to an even faster deployment of AI technology in every industry, be it software development, technical services, banking, insurance, manufacturing, or agriculture,\u201d his team wrote in their analysis.\n\nOver two years since ChatGPT helped spark an AI boom, American tech giants are still making hefty investments in their AI programs. In January, Microsoft announced plans to invest about $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on AI data centers, and President Donald Trump announced the creation of Stargate, a collaboration between OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle that plans to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the coming years.\n\nSee more\n\nArtificial intelligence jobs are in especially high demand in the consulting sector, Gupta said, since non-AI firms typically hire consulting firms like Accenture and Bain to help develop AI tools \u2014 for example, a machine learning engineer or a product manager for a generative AI tool. Accounting firm Ernst & Young reported in December that 97% of business leaders whose organizations invested in AI saw positive returns on investment.\n\nBut many companies may still be slow to adopt the technology amid potential privacy and security risks, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.\n\nEfficiency concerns are top of mind for companies\n\nAI job growth is occurring alongside a broarder slowdown in hiring across the job market. Companies are increasingly looking to \u201cdo more with less,\u201d said Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, which tracks publicly available workforce data.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been centralizing functions, eradicating unnecessary roles, reviewing every function and reducing layers of management, focusing very closely on cost control,\u201d ZipRecruiter\u2019s Pollak said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a direct result of high interest rates and reduced access to credit.\u201d\n\nDespite the higher demand for AI jobs, it is too soon to tell how the AI boom is impacting specific jobs, Pollak added. She speculates hiring plans may be \u201cleaner\u201d now because AI tools have made some fields, such as content writing, more efficient.\n\n\u201cWe think that the jobs that are in particular adopting AI are seeing larger hiring declines,\u201d Simon said.\n\nCompanies\u2019 efforts to \u201cdo more with less\u201d extend beyond using AI in the workplace, with Revelio Labs reporting last week that US companies are increasingly hiring for high-skilled positions abroad, especially those that are suitable for remote work.\n\n\u201cThe realization that companies no longer need to hire consultants or software engineers in the most expensive location has made offshoring an attractive, cost-saving option in workforce planning,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe tech industry experienced rapid growth during the pandemic, as in-person businesses transitioned to online goods and services. But consumer behavior and economic activity have returned to pre-pandemic patterns, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.\n\nJobs in the software publishing sector grew 30% from March 2020 to September 2022 \u2014 but shrank 1% between September 2022 and December 2024, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Nationally, post-pandemic growth has been steadier, with a 2% increase in jobs between March 2020 and September 2022 and a 4% increase since then.\n\nAs for fears that AI will lead to mass unemployment, Gupta offered a more optimistic view, saying he believes the corporate world will instead adapt to the efficiency enabled by the technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when a six-day work week was the norm, and now (we have a) five-day work week,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cCould it be that in 10-20 years, it\u2019s a four-day work week? I think the prospects of that are very, very high.\u201d",

        "text": "In the industrial town of Rupganj outside of Bangladesh\u2019s capital, clothing manufacturer Fakir Fashions is using artificial intelligence to automatically pause production and avoid waste when something goes wrong in its knitting operations.\n\nAI technology has also allowed the fashion supplier, which employs about 10,000 workers, to dismiss dozens of human quality inspectors, said managing director Fakir Kamruzzaman Nahid.\n\nSuppliers and brands across the US$1.7 trillion global fashion industry are beginning to use AI technology, such as in cameras and sensors that detect defects, to boost production and to reduce their environmental impact, including by monitoring emissions and water use.\n\nThe sector is responsible for between 2 per cent to 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. It is also one of the world\u2019s major polluters of water sources and produces vast amounts of waste that wind up in landfills.\n\nWhile AI could help improve the apparel business\u2019 environmental track record, it also poses a threat to some of the 75 million jobs in the labour-intensive industry worldwide, already under pressure from other forms of automation.\n\n\u201c The influence of AI on jobs is a million-dollar question that we are all pondering, and my wager is that AI in fashion will complement rather than replace humans.

While there is no comprehensive research into AI\u2019s potential to reduce the industry\u2019s emissions, a few studies offer clues at how it might help. For example, using digital samples of clothes before going into production could cut carbon dioxide emissions by 30 per cent in the design and development of clothes. Sweden\u2019s H&M Group, the world\u2019s second-largest clothing retailer, has said it is investing in AI tools to recycle post-consumer waste and reduce deforestation by fashion manufacturers. Smartex, a company based in Portugal that is developing AI for the textile industry, has sold its technology to help save energy and water to factories in about 10 countries, said Max Easton, director of global innovation.",

        "text": "Job displacement concerns are on the rise as artificial intelligence and automation penetrate the workforce.\n\nA February 2024 Gallup survey showed 22% of respondents feared technology would take over their jobs, while 72% of Fortune 500 chief HR officers foresee AI replacing jobs in the next three years.\n\nIndustries such as customer service and manufacturing are increasingly adopting AI technologies, including machine learning in routine and repetitive tasks, raising the question of whether AI will replace certain jobs.\n\n\"While both legacy AI and generative AI are good at automating redundant tasks -- such as looking at data and generating insights -- there are many aspects, such as emotional intelligence and nuanced arguments, that AI cannot replace,\" said Mark Beccue, principal analyst at TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group. \"AI is not good at nonlinear thinking, and therefore, solving human problems can't be the strength of AI.\"\n\nDuring the 2023 Gartner IT Symposium in Barcelona, Spain, analysts even talked about how the era of generative AI is anticipated to transform human-machine relationships with most companies working alongside robotic colleagues by 2025.\n\nEven with the growing human-robotic integration and technological advancements in AI, certain jobs remain immune to AI takeover. This is mainly because these roles will continue to require deep empathy, emotional depth, human creativity and a specific level of human interaction that AI cannot replicate.\n\n1. Social workers Social work relies on empathy, trust and emotional insight to support individuals and communities dealing with issues such as poverty, abuse and mental health. Empathy is the key ingredient in social work that distinguishes it from roles susceptible to AI, said Melissa Campbell, patient and family relations specialist at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover, N.H., with an extensive background in social work. \"Social work requires understanding and empathy to connect with clients on an emotional level, but AI lacks the ability to feel emotion and respond with genuine empathy,\" Campbell said. \"AI can process data and follow algorithms, but it isn't able to navigate moral and ethical complexities that many social workers need to deal with.\" Campbell illustrated her point with a case example of a social worker named Jane, who learns during a confidential conversation with parent Maria that she has occasionally relapsed into substance use. Maria trusts Jane and fears losing her children if this information is disclosed. The ethical consideration is that Jane must navigate the obligation to maintain client confidentiality, while also having a legal and ethical duty to report any information that could indicate a risk to the children's safety. This is a situation that AI couldn't navigate successfully. Here are some reasons why AI can't replace certain jobs.\n\n2. Performing arts Performing arts is another field that AI can never fully penetrate. While AI can be used to enhance performances or assist with the creation of new artistic experiences, the possibility of it replacing the core elements of performing arts is unrealistic. Beccue believes AI doesn't have a place in performing arts. \"While tools like Adobe Firefly demonstrate how commercial creatives use automation to streamline their work, certain creative processes, such as singing, acting, performing on stage and orchestrating large celebrations, remain uniquely human and cannot be replicated by AI,\" Beccue said. Some might argue that AI technologies, including deepfake and 3D modeling, could change the movie industry. But, despite advances in these technologies -- such as de-aging actors or recreating performers that are no longer alive -- actors remain essential for scripting and directing these technologies. Their expertise ensures authentic emotional expression and movement, demonstrating that AI cannot fully replace human roles in this field.\n\n3. Doctors and healthcare workers AI is revolutionizing healthcare, as seen in breakthroughs such as sepsis detection, skin cancer diagnosis and algorithms that predict atrial fibrillation 30 minutes before onset, enabling time for preemptive intervention. While AI enhances medical care and diagnostics, it can't replace the nuanced judgment and emotional support provided by doctors and healthcare workers. A Pew Research Center survey found that 60% of participants would feel uncomfortable if their healthcare provider relied on AI for their medical care. Expecting patients to trust a robot or algorithm with critical, life-altering decisions, such as deciding to take a painkiller or starting a treatment plan for a disease, is unrealistic. Even in tasks where machines excel, such as taking blood samples, human doctors are essential for delivering life-changing diagnoses, guiding therapy and providing emotional support. Algorithms just can't replace this human touch. The human-in-the-loop approach emphasizes collaboration between AI and healthcare professionals -- specifically with large language model tools, such as Gemini and ChatGPT -- ensuring AI complements human expertise in the medical field, rather than taking over their roles.\n\n4. Leadership roles in an organization Leadership roles require nuanced communication and complex decision-making skills that can't be reduced to simple code or a linear process. According to research conducted by Potential Project, most people doubt AI's ability to understand human behavior at work as well as human leaders do, with 57% lacking trust and 22% remaining neutral. Of the more than 600 employees surveyed, 45% were open to positive AI-generated performance feedback, perhaps due to AI's capability for personalized, real-time insights; however, that does not suggest that AI can replace human leadership. The same report also highlighted employees continually prefer a human manager over AI. While AI can handle routine tasks -- giving leaders more time for strategy and personal engagement -- it can't replace them. Effective leaders bring vision for the future, strategic thinking, team motivation and a level of authenticity that even well-trained AI models can't bring to the table.\n\n5. Spiritual and faith-based roles The possibility of AI as a replacement for faith-based services is far-fetched as it could erode the sense of community and human connection that is a central element of religious congregations in all major world religions. For example, a Catholic organization in the U.S. developed an AI priest named Father Justin, which was eventually shut down due to its absurd and inaccurate recommendations. This included the suggestion that it was OK to baptize babies with Gatorade. \"In my role as a pastor, AI does not have any direct impact. It can be useful for quick facts or answering questions from parishioners, but I don't use it to write my homilies,\" said the Rev. Deogratias O. Ekisa, director of seminarians at Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans. Ekisa said he once requested a homily from ChatGPT, but it included some made-up facts and wasn't written in his voice. \"It was not an expression of what I believe and want to convey, drawn from my prayer, personal experiences and my relationship with God,\" Ekisa said. Ekisa said, while automation is a useful tool and is used by many churches and religious organizations, it can't replace that central personal contact. \"AI cannot counsel people or provide comfort in moments of sickness and death -- personal services that are the core of faith-based roles,\" he said.\n\n6. Politicians Political roles typically involve complex decision-making, negotiation and empathetic leadership skills that go beyond data analysis and automation. A website named Will Robots Take My Job, which assesses any job's vulnerability to automation and robots, categorizes the job of political scientists as having a low-risk vulnerability of 25%. However, stories of political candidates attempting to share duties with AI chatbots are surfacing. For example, Victor Miller, a mayoral candidate in Cheyenne, Wyo., filed paperwork for him and his customized ChatGPT bot named Virtual Integrated Citizen, which he calls Vic. During his campaign pitch at the local library, Miller claimed that Vic would use technology from OpenAI to make political decisions and help govern the city. OpenAI later shut down Miller's account, as using ChatGPT for political campaigning or lobbying violates its policies. On its website, OpenAI explains that it restricts activities related to political campaigning or lobbying, including the creation of campaign materials tailored to or aimed at specific demographics. While the idea of using chatbots to help run the administrative elements of political campaigns can be intriguing, relying entirely on automated systems for critical decisions, such as managing the economy or setting abortion policy, could lead to serious and potentially disastrous consequences.\n\n7. Skilled trades Skilled trades, such as plumbers, electricians and craftsmen, are challenging for AI to replace as they require manual dexterity, the ability to adapt to unpredictable situations and problem-solving skills. For instance, plumbers navigate complex plumbing systems, often crawling inside tight places and making real-time decisions based on the specific requirements of each job. AI simply cannot match this level of physical agility and critical thinking. Moreover, many skilled trades involve significant human interaction, emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills. For example, an electrician must not only fix wiring issues, but also reassure homeowners about safety concerns, which involves a level of empathy and understanding that AI cannot offer. While AI can't replace skilled trades, it can enhance them by providing predictive maintenance. In HVAC systems, AI algorithms can be used to analyze data from temperature, pressure and sensor data to detect potential issues before they occur. For example, if a fan's vibration patterns deviate from the norm, the sensors might predict an impending failure and schedule maintenance before a breakdown occurs. This can help technicians schedule preventive maintenance and save homeowners from unexpected breakdowns and costly repairs.",

        "text": "CITIGROUP said artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to displace more jobs across the banking industry than in any other sector as the technology is poised to upend consumer finance and make workers more productive.\n\nAbout 54 per cent of jobs across banking have a high potential to be automated, the bank said on Wednesday (Jun 19) in a new report on AI. An additional 12 per cent of roles across the industry could be augmented with the technology, Citigroup found.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest banks have slowly begun experimenting more with AI over the last year, spurred by the promise that it will help them boost staffers\u2019 productivity and cut costs.\n\nAt Citigroup, for instance, the firm has said it would equip its 40,000 coders with the ability to experiment with different AI technologies, and the company has said it\u2019s used generative AI, which can produce sentences, essays or poetry based on a user\u2019s simple questions or commands, to quickly comb through hundreds of pages of regulatory proposals.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is scooping up talent and chief executive officer Jamie Dimon has said he believes the technology will allow employers to shrink the workweek to just 3.5 days. Deutsche Bank is using artificial intelligence to scan wealthy client portfolios. And ING Groep is screening for potential defaulters.\n\nGenerative AI \u201chas the potential to revolutionise the banking industry and improve profitability\u201d, David Griffiths, Citigroup\u2019s chief technology officer, said. \u201cAt Citi, we are focused on implementing AI in a safe and responsible way to amplify the power of Citi and our people.\u201d\n\nEven if AI does replace some roles across the industry, Citigroup said, the technology might not lead to a drop in headcount. Financial firms will likely need to hire a bevvy of AI managers and AI-focused compliance officers to help them ensure their use of the technology is in line with regulations.\n\nPlus, new technologies have not always led to job cuts. In one example Citigroup offered, the number of human tellers soared between the 1970s and mid-2000s even after the introduction of automated teller machines. BLOOMBERG",

        "text": "Your browser doesn\u2019t support HTML5\n\nChatGPT and other generative AI tools have raised concerns that chatbots will replace many kinds of workers. Writers, editors, and customer service representatives are among the jobs that could be affected.\n\nBut some people are suggesting that AI might not reduce jobs as many people fear. Instead, the technology might turn out to be more like the technological developments of the past, such as the steam engine, electricity or the internet.\n\nSupporters reason that AI might destroy some jobs while creating others. They also say that the technology will probably make workers more productive, benefiting themselves, their employers and the economy.\n\nLooking for lessons from history\n\nNick Bunker is an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, part of a job search website. He said he thinks AI \u201cwill affect many, many jobs \u2014 maybe every job indirectly\u201d to some degree.\n\nBunker added that he does not believe the technology is going to lead to a lot of unemployment. \u201cWe have seen other big technological events in our history, and those didn\u2019t lead to a large rise in unemployment. Technology destroys but also creates. There will be new jobs that come about,\u201d he said.\n\nArtificial intelligence gives machines the ability to perform tasks once thought to require human intelligence. The basic technology has existed in early versions for many years.\n\nSome reports say it began with a problem-solving computer program called Logic Theorist. The program was developed in the 1950s at what is now Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. More recent examples include voice assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, or IBM\u2019s chess-playing computer, Deep Blue, which defeated then-world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\nPredictions and current evidence\n\nSam Altman is the chief of OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Altman said in a discussion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in May that he believes, \u201cAI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function.\u2019'\n\nSome people say that AI chatbots are not replacing human workers in a widespread way. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a company that tracks job cuts, said it has yet to see much evidence of job losses caused by AI.\n\nHowever, the fear that AI is a threat to some kinds of jobs has a basis in reality.\n\nSuumit Shah is an Indian business owner who announced last year that he had replaced 90 percent of his customer support workers with a chatbot named Lina. Shah\u2019s company, Dukaan, helps customers set up e-commerce sites to sell goods online. Shah said the average amount of time it took to answer a customer\u2019s question shrank from 1 minute, 44 seconds to \u201cinstant.\u201d The chatbot also cut the time needed to resolve problems from more than two hours to just over three minutes.\n\nA 2023 study by researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University identified jobs most exposed to AI models. The jobs included telemarketers and teachers of English and foreign languages. But being affected by AI does not necessarily mean losing your job to it. AI can free people to do more creative jobs.\n\nThe Swedish company IKEA introduced a customer-service chatbot in 2021 to deal with simple questions. Instead of cutting jobs, IKEA kept 8,500 customer-service workers to advise buyers on interior design and to deal with complex customer calls.\n\nChatbots can also make workers more efficient. Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University, Danielle Li and Lindsey Raymond of MIT studied 5,200 customer-support agents at a large company. The agents used a generative AI-based assistant. The AI tool provided valuable suggestions. It also supplied links to useful company documents.\n\nThe researchers found that those who used the chatbot were 14 percent more productive than workers who did not use the chatbot. The workers who used AI took more calls and completed them faster. The biggest productivity gains \u2014 34 percent \u2014 came from the least-experienced, least-skilled workers.\n\nAlorica is a company in Irvine, California, that runs customer-service centers around the world. The company has introduced an artificial intelligence translation tool that lets its representatives communicate with customers who speak any of 200 different languages and 75 dialects.\n\nThe Real-time Voice Language Translation tool also lets customers and Alorica agents speak and hear each other in their own languages.\n\n\u201cIt allows (Alorica reps) to handle every call they get,\u201d said Rene Paiz, a vice president of customer service. Paiz added, \u201cI don\u2019t have to hire externally\" just to find someone who speaks a specific language.\n\nAlorica said it is not cutting jobs. It continues to seek new employees who are comfortable with new technology.\n\n\u201cWe are still actively hiring,\u2019\u2019 Paiz says. \u201cWe have a lot that needs to be done out there.\u2019\u2019\n\nI\u2019m John Russell.\n\nAnd I'm Ashley Thompson.\n\nPaul Wiseman reported on this story for the Associated Press.

        "text": "Earlier this month, software firm Workday announced that it would be laying off more than 1,700 workers\u2014or about 8.5% of its workforce\u2014to redirect investment toward artificial intelligence. The announcement was the latest in a series of mass layoffs that have put hundreds of thousands of workers at Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, and other tech companies out of work over the past several years. Google and Meta are among the tech giants that have cited the need to invest resources in AI development as the reason for cutting jobs. AI is also a part of the rationale behind the raft of mass federal employees layoffs.\n\nMuch of the narrative about AI and jobs has focused on the threat of automation: What can AI do as well as\u2014or better than\u2014humans? Research on AI-driven job displacement often focuses on forecasting which jobs or tasks machines could perform in the future, and then estimating how many workers might be displaced due to this automation. A report might tell us that 30% of work hours could be automated by 2030, or a study might predict that 5% of work tasks across the economy could be performed by AI in the next 10 years.\n\nWhile automation is a risk that needs to be understood and taken seriously, this framing misses a key aspect of what's happening in the economy now. After many tech firms overhired during the pandemic, companies are cutting jobs and investing in AI not to directly replace workers with machines, but to signal to investors that they're focused on future growth and profitability.\n\nFortunately, workers and unions are fighting back, both against AI-driven job displacement in private industry and against DOGE's attempts to dismantle the public service.\n\nMass layoffs are nothing new. As Les Leopold argues in his book Wall Street's War on Workers, for decades corporations have carried out mass layoffs not out of fiscal desperation, but as part of a strategy to further enrich wealthy shareholders through stock buybacks and leveraged buyouts. But now we are seeing how AI hype has become the latest justification for firing workers en masse. Tech firms aren't waiting around to see what roles AI can and can't replace before laying workers off. Instead, they're slashing jobs and redirecting resources to AI initiatives because the mere promise of AI-driven efficiency is enough to excite investors and drive up stock prices.\n\nThis strategy creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where tech firms devalue human labor to make automation seem inevitable. By carrying out mass layoffs, tech firms signal to investors and workers themselves that workers are replaceable. By reinvesting those resources in AI, firms make it more likely that AI will eventually become capable enough to replace the workers they already decided to eliminate.\n\nThe strategy of hyping AI to justify mass layoffs is exemplified by Swedish tech firm Klarna. As Noam Scheiber reports in The New York Times, when the company laid off 700 customer service workers last year, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski didn't just announce the cuts\u2014he celebrated them. In media appearances and investor calls, Siemiatkowski proudly predicted that the company's workforce would eventually shrink to less than half its size thanks to AI-enabled productivity gains. As Scheiber reports, Siemiatkowski may even have overstated Klarna's progress in automating jobs to try to make the company more appealing to investors. For example, while the CEO claimed that AI enabled the company to become so efficient that it halted all new hiring a year and a half ago, journalists have found that the company continues to post job listings for vacant positions. The Klarna example shows how, for some companies, automation isn't just about replacing workers with machines; it is about redefining human labor as a temporary necessity to be tolerated until AI makes it obsolete. Like many tech firms, Klarna is betting that by hyping AI's potential while disinvesting in workers, they can make their vision of an automated future into a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nElon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency( DOGE) is now bringing the AI-fueled mass layoff strategy to the federal government. Through DOGE, Musk and his allies are experimenting with AI tools \"to identify budget cuts and detect waste and abuse,\" in agencies like the Department of Education and the General Services Administration (GSA). Staffers report that DOGE aims to reduce GSA's budget by up to 50%. As The Washington Post reports, \"DOGE associates have been feeding vast troves of government records and databases into artificial intelligence tools, looking for unwanted federal programs and trying to determine which human work can be replaced by AI, machine-learning tools, or even robots.\" In other words, Musk is exploring how he can use AI as justification for carrying out mass layoffs across the federal government. The message these tactics send is clear: Decades of public service experience can be dismissed in minutes if an AI system suggests your role is redundant.\n\nThe DOGE-led mass layoffs are part of a decades-long conservative project of shrinking the federal workforce and weakening the administrative state. But what's new is how AI hype, and the guise of Silicon Valley efficiency, is being used to add a veneer of technological inevitability to this political project. \"The federal government is suddenly being run like an AI startup,\" writes Kyle Chayka in a recent piece in The New Yorker. When DOGE staffers cite AI assessments as justification for eliminating positions, they're following the same playbook as tech CEOs: using speculative claims about AI capabilities to make workforce reduction seem like an unavoidable consequence of progress rather than a deliberate choice. DOGE's promises of AI-driven efficiency mask the reality that many government functions still require human judgment, institutional knowledge, and public service experience that no algorithm can replace. This combination of hostile management and AI hype isn't just about cutting costs\u2014it's about redefining public service as something that can be evaluated by an algorithm and eliminated at the whims of a tech oligarch.\n\nFortunately, workers and unions are fighting back, both against AI-driven job displacement in private industry and against DOGE's attempts to dismantle the public service.\n\nWorkers are successfully using collective action to establish guardrails around AI usage and ensure technology serves rather than replaces human labor. The nearly five-month strike by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) in 2023 was motivated in large part by concerns that Hollywood studios would seek to use AI in ways that undermine workers or replace them altogether. SAG-AFTRA and WGA eventually won contracts that established frameworks for how studios can and cannot use AI during the production process, ensuring that AI cannot replace human writers and actors without their consent and fair compensation. As labor journalist Alex Press reports, similar fights have played out across workplaces in the hospitality, tech, and logistics industries. Through effective strikes and collective bargaining, workers can influence how AI is implemented in the workplace, and secure protections against mass layoffs.\n\nUnions representing federal employees are also mounting a host of legal challenges to protect workers and preserve government services. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and several other unions filed suit to block what it called \"arbitrary and capricious\" job cuts laid out in the Trump administration's federal worker buyout program. Meanwhile, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's directive to halt the bureau's operations, which the union alleges violates the constitutional separation of powers. While not directly a response to DOGE's use of AI, the lawsuits show how unions are taking action to oppose efforts to weaken federal agencies and devalue the work of career civil servants. As DOGE looks to use AI to justify mass layoffs, these lawsuits could establish important legal precedents to help protect workers from arbitrary dismissal based on algorithmic assessments.\n\nRecent job cuts in the tech sector and in the federal government show how AI hype is being used to justify mass layoffs. Through collective action, workers are showing that AI's impact isn't predetermined by technology\u2014it can be shaped through worker power.\n\nThis article first appeared on Power at Work and is republished here with permission.",

Care economy jobs, including nursing professionals, social workers, and personal care aides, are also expected to grow significantly. So will roles in the education industry.\n\nBut for IT workers, if you're not picking up skills in AI, big data, or software development, you could be left behind. The WEF also forecasts strong job growth for roles in robotics, autonomous systems, and energy generation, with specialists in areas like renewable energy engineering and electric vehicle technologies expected to enjoy greater job security.\n\nThe report rates the rising cost of living as the second-most transformative trend, suggesting it will cost 1.6 million jobs.\n\nBut respondents\u2019 opinions suggest those jobs will be replaced.\n\n\"On current trends over the 2025 to 2030 period job creation and destruction due to structural labor-market transformation will amount to 22 percent of today\u2019s total jobs.

        "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) should be able to help rather than replace jobs, the Economic Survey 2024-25 said on Friday. It said that some of the fears about AI being hugely disruptive to employment might be \u201cmisplaced\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt said that for India, a services-driven economy with a youthful and adaptable workforce, the adoption of AI offers the potential to support economic growth and improve labour market outcomes.\n\n\u201cTechnological developments over recent years have generated much discussion on the impact of AI on India\u2019s labour market. The integration of AI into India\u2019s labour market presents an opportunity to enhance productivity, elevate workforce quality and create employment, provided, systemic challenges are effectively addressed through robust institutional frameworks,\u201d it said.\n\nIt said that India\u2019s employment challenge is not just about numbers but also about raising the overall \u2018quality\u2019 of the workforce and quality in this case does not just mean imparting knowledge through a step-by-step guide to leveraging AI, or providing very specific training related to \u2018AI oriented jobs.\u2019\n\n\u201cTechnology-specific skills run the risk of becoming obsolete very soon, especially in today\u2019s world where the requirements shift rapidly,\u201d it noted.\n\nIt also mentioned that prioritising education and skill development will be crucial to equipping workers with the competencies needed to thrive in an AI-augmented landscape. By capitalising on the global infancy of AI, India has the opportunity to prepare its labour force for a future defined by collaboration between human and machine intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe must also use this time to put in place mechanisms to cushion societal impacts, a challenge that resonates deeply with India\u2019s unique demographic and economic landscape,\u201d it said.\n\nSocial responsibility\n\nThe Survey also said that corporate sector has to display a high degree of social responsibility and although the impact of AI on labour will be felt across the world, the problem is magnified for India, given its size and its relatively low per capita income.\n\n\u201cIf companies do not optimise the introduction of AI over a longer horizon and do not handle it with sensitivity, the demand for policy intervention and the demand on fiscal resources to compensate will be irresistible,\u201d it said.\n\nThe State, in turn, has to resort to taxation of profits generated from the replacement of labour with technology to mobilise those resources, as the IMF suggested. It will leave everyone worse off and the country\u2019s growth potential will suffer, as a result, the Survey said.\n\nIt added that the services sector, including banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI), healthcare, telecom, retail, and transport and logistics, stands out for its rapid AI adoption, supported by various national initiatives and technologies.\n\nAI governance framework\n\nMeanwhile, the Survey also highlighted that establishing robust AI governance is the first and crucial step in addressing the challenges that come with the implementation of AI systems.\n\nWithout an appropriate governance framework, AI systems may operate without clear guidelines or oversight, leading to potential abuse or misuse of technology, it said.\n\n\u201cAs vulnerabilities could evolve with the pace of innovation and degree of AI integration in financial services, regulatory and supervisory effectiveness may take a backseat if financial regulators\u2019 AI-related skills and knowledge do not keep pace with developments in this space,\u201d it said.\n\nAccordingly, the RBI has proactively engaged with regulated entities and experts to assess the ongoing developments while effectively communicating its expectations through multiple engagement fora. It has also created a regulatory sandbox focusing on innovative technology products/services and announced the establishment of a committee to create a Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of Artificial Intelligence (FREE-AI) in the financial sector.",

Learn what you need to know and what you can do to prepare yourself.\n\neWEEK content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.\n\nAs organizations across all industries increasingly integrate artificial intelligence into workflows, the technology is driving fears about the job market and the future of work. Will AI replace humans? The only clear answer is \u201cmaybe.\u201d Some jobs are more likely to experience AI disruption than others, with those consisting mainly of rote tasks more at risk. Some white collar jobs are already seeing AI integrated into their workflows, while jobs that require complex physical movements and human judgment\u2014think plumbing or construction\u2014are unlikely to be replaced by AI anytime soon. And jobs that require social and emotional skills, like teaching and social work, may never be. So, will artificial intelligence replace humans at work? No one can be sure, but here\u2019s everything you need to know to form your own opinion.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2022 Artificial intelligence will not replace humans for all jobs but it will change the way we work as more workers use AI tools to increase productivity. (Jump to Section)\n\n(Jump to Section) \u2022 Jobs most at risk of AI disruption and replacement are those consisting mainly of repetitive tasks, while jobs least at risk are those requiring social, emotional and interpersonal skills. (Jump to Section)\n\n(Jump to Section) \u2022\n\nMany AI experts predict that AI will open up more job opportunities than it removes from the economy, and that the technology will be a net positive for job growth in the near future. (Jump to Section)\n\nWill AI Replace Humans? Not All of Them\n\nLike any new technology, artificial intelligence will cause job displacement in the near and distant future. According to a YouGov survey, 48 percent of working Americans believe that AI will decrease the number of jobs in their industry, a figure that has risen from 29 percent in March 2023. However, it\u2019s unlikely the technology will replace all humans in the workforce. AI\u2019s primary long-term effect on the labor market will probably be one of job change and creation, not elimination.\n\nIn a recent research paper, \u201cThe Impact of AI on US Labor Markets,\u201d AI researchers and computer scientists from Austin Peay State University echoed this prediction. \u201cOur findings suggest a more optimistic outlook for the labor market,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwhere rather than displacing jobs and workers, AI technologies have the potential to enhance their capabilities and create new opportunities.\u201d\n\nIn other words, workers will use AI as a tool to automate busywork so they can spend more time on complex tasks and activities that require human-centric qualities like leadership, empathy, intuition, and relationship-building. AI will augment humans, not replace them.\n\nAI May Also Create New Jobs For Humans\n\nMany experts believe AI will create more jobs than it makes obsolete. According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cFuture of Jobs Report,\u201d employers \u201canticipate a structural labor market churn of 23 percent of jobs in the next five years\u201d and a disruption of 44 percent of workers\u2019 skills. Overall, however, the labor market prediction is optimistic, with the impact of most technologies on jobs expected to be a net positive over the next five years.\n\nAI Job Displacement Will Vary by Role and Region\n\nSome jobs are more likely to experience AI disruption than others. Jobs consisting mainly of rote tasks are more at risk of total elimination, while white collar jobs like data analysis, customer service, marketing, and programming are already seeing AI integrated into their workflows. Jobs that require complex physical movements along with human judgment are likely to go on without much AI disruption, at least for now.\n\nJobs like teaching and social work rely on emotional intelligence and social skills, which AI cannot replicate. They may never experience AI replacement. Blue and white collar workers who leverage AI and learn to work alongside it are far safer than those who ignore it.\n\nAs it differs by job category, AI exposure also differs by country. According to the International Monetary Fund, about 60 percent of jobs in advanced economies are exposed to AI disruption compared to 40 percent globally. Firms in these economies are more poised to integrate AI and, at least in theory, have the financial backing, educated workforce, fine-tuned processes, AI-forward attitudes, and advanced technologies to cost-efficiently exploit AI.\n\nThe Current State of AI and Job Displacement\n\nAlthough generative AI has made an impact on marketing and data analysis jobs, it hasn\u2019t caused significant layoffs\u2014workers are using the tools rather than competing with them. So far, AI adoption is most prevalent in tech-driven industries like IT, finance, and education.\n\nAI\u2019s Impact by Industry and Role\n\nDespite AI\u2019s high news profile, its adoption rate is low. According to an analysis by the North Carolina Department of Commerce, only 5 percent U.S. businesses are currently using it. Adoption rates vary by industry, with IT, science, professional, tech, and educational services leading the charge while agriculture, utilities, construction, and transportation/warehousing bring up the rear.\n\nAs for specific jobs, generative AI has made its biggest impact over the last year on marketing and data analysis, putting jobs that require these skills most at risk. However, we have yet to see huge layoffs. Based on the same YouGov report, there is an increase in AI tool usage among employed Americans, from 20 percent in July 2023 to 27 percent now. It seems that marketers, analysts, content creators, and other professionals in the leading industries for AI adoption are integrating AI into their workflows rather than losing their livelihoods, as many had feared when ChatGPT was released.\n\nRecent Statistics on AI-Driven Layoffs\n\nIt might be too early in the GenAI boom to gather definitive research, but surveys of business owners and employees can provide some insight into how AI is affecting job loss. For example, employees responding to Asana\u2019s \u201cThe State of AI at Work\u201d survey in 2023 said that AI could, in theory, replace 29 percent of their work tasks. Another report by Resume Builder surveyed 750 business leaders at companies that planned to integrate or had already integrated AI\u2014some key findings include the following:\n\nA third said they planned to replace employees with AI in 2024\n\n37 percent of those already using AI said it had replaced workers in 2023\n\n44 percent predicted that AI would cause layoffs in 2024\n\nCorporations exist to maximize profits\u2014they cut costs where they can, and AI represents the potential for serious decreases in labor costs. But the report also showed consensus among business leaders that AI skills can safeguard employees from AI replacement. Nearly 83 percent said that AI skills will help current employees keep their jobs, and 96 percent of those hiring in 2024 said candidates with AI skills are more attractive.\n\nTaken together with World Economic Forum predictions that AI will increase the total number of jobs, the story may well be that many of those laid off in the coming years will be let go not because AI is replacing them but because they don\u2019t work effectively with AI tools. In addition, although concerns about AI-driven job loss are high, only two percent of Americans personally experienced job loss or salary reductions due to AI, as per YouGov.\n\nExpert Opinions on AI\u2019s Capabilities and Limitations\n\nThere\u2019s a consensus among AI experts, investors, and technologists that white collar jobs are the most likely to be impacted since they rely heavily on generative AI\u2019s three greatest strengths: data analysis, content creation, and digital task automation. Here are a few examples:\n\nIn a recent interview, Burning Glass Institute\u2019s Chief Economist Gad Levanon said that today\u2019s most popular applications of AI focus on using language to acquire and generate content. As a result, the technology is more likely to affect white-collar jobs than blue-collar jobs that require physical abilities.\n\nInvestors at J.P. Morgan\u2019s fifth Annual Global Machine Learning Conference shared their views about which industries will be most affected by generative AI, citing marketing, legal services and insurance, data analytics, and consumer tech.\n\nThe hybrid model of skilled employees using the technology to improve their own efficiency and capability looks increasingly viable for certain industries and roles. For example, copywriters might use an AI writing tool to create a rough draft, but use their company knowledge, writer\u2019s intuition, and facility with language to polish it into a compelling sales page.\n\nIn a Daily Mail interview, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the hybrid model of humans working with the technology rather than being replaced by it is likely to continue being successful in the near future in white collar roles, with blue collar jobs having the least AI exposure.\n\n4 Jobs at High Risk of AI Replacement\n\nSome jobs are in more danger than others. For now, at least, many of these at-risk positions are more likely to be changed by AI rather than eliminated by it, but that may change as AI continues to advance.\n\nCustomer Service Representatives\n\nCustomer service representatives in call centers and businesses are already being replaced by AI chatbots. Some customers would rather interact with chatbots than speak to a human for simple queries like forgotten passwords, and this option is generally less costly for businesses.\n\nThese applications rely on interactive voice response software, which uses natural language processing to understand and respond to customer questions, but there will always be a need for customer service reps at higher skill levels. For example, businesses need customer-facing reps to grow relationships with customers and handle more complex customer challenges.\n\nData Entry and Administrative Roles\n\nData entry and administrative positions that primarily move data across systems and handle repetitive administrative tasks\u2014for example, office managers, bookkeepers, assistants, and receptionists\u2014are at high risk of being automated. Upskilling and learning how to take on more strategic components of the job can protect these workers from AI replacement and also give them the potential to do more meaningful, high-paying work.\n\nDrivers and Transportation Workers\n\nCurrently, AI technologies are mostly used to increase driver safety and efficiency rather than actually take over the driver\u2019s seat. However, AI researchers recently predicted AI will outperform truck drivers by 2027, though autonomous trucks will likely still require human supervision. Autonomous vehicles also put transportation workers like Uber and Lyft drivers at risk, as seen on the streets of San Francisco, but legal issues, ethical concerns, and public attitudes toward self-driving cars could hold back the technology\u2019s integration into society.\n\nBasic Programming and Coding Tasks\n\nIn a cruel twist of fate, programming jobs are some of the first and most common to be replaced by AI. Large language model-powered tools like Chat-GPT can write simple code and execute basic programming tasks, and AI developer tools make it easy for businesses to build websites and create apps without any code at all. Skilled coders who know how to problem-solve and innovate are likely still safe from automation\u2014in fact, they actually stand to benefit from the boom, as they can use these AI tools to increase their coding efficiency and the quality of their outputs.\n\n4 Jobs Likely Safe from AI Replacement\n\nJobs that put a high premium on soft skills like problem-solving, leadership, judgment, and emotional intelligence are relatively safe from AI replacement. Below are four of the safest jobs in the oncoming AI revolution.\n\nTeachers and Educators\n\nTeachers and educators are unlikely to be replaced by AI anytime soon. Algorithms can help teachers identify weak spots in student understanding by analyzing their performance\u2014Khan Academy uses one for this purpose, for example\u2014but they cannot replace an educator\u2019s enthusiasm for the material, relationships with students, and overall authority, which are all vital for the generational transmission of knowledge, ethics, and character.\n\nHealthcare Professionals\n\nRobotic hands can help surgeons improve their surgery, and AI imaging technology can help them improve the accuracy of their diagnoses. But a highly trained neurosurgeon, nurse, or any healthcare professional does far more in the course of their work than just these AI-augmented tasks. Healthcare professionals form relationships with patients, guide them and their loved ones through treatments, and perform both technical and soft skills\u2014persuading a patient to follow a new diet, for example, or displaying empathy while revealing a tough diagnosis\u2014that AI cannot do on its own.\n\nSkilled Trades\n\nThere are many complex tasks involved in diagnosing a leak, tiling a roof, or building a patio, and AI still doesn\u2019t have the physical dexterity or problem solving abilities to handle them. There may be some exceptionally distant day when a humanoid robot can handle these tasks, but can the robot then actually gain the trust of the owners? In essence, these jobs require a combination of human judgment and the ability to talk with clients and business about why a certain pipe or electrical fixture needs to be replaced, at what cost, and on what timeline.\n\nLeadership and Management Roles\n\nArtificial intelligence can help managers make data-driven decisions, create plans, and gain visibility into their team\u2019s performance, but it won\u2019t replace them. People struggle enough to follow the lead of qualified humans\u2014why would they listen to a robot? Leaders and managers are necessary for inspiring, guiding, and coaching staff, as well as networking with leaders from other departments or institutions. To make snap strategic decisions, they also rely on knowledge and intuition about stakeholder interests, employee abilities, market dynamics, and other qualitative factors that are often invisible or meaningless to an AI algorithm.\n\nBenefits of AI in the Workplace\n\nAI is set to change the workplace in a wide array of ways, from increasing worker efficiency to creating new job opportunities. Making employees aware of the benefits of artificial intelligence can go a long way toward mitigating their fears that it will replace them.\n\nIncreased Efficiency and Productivity\n\nArtificial intelligence can increase worker efficiency and productivity across industries by automating repetitive tasks and informing data-driven decisions. Salespeople are already using AI sales tools to analyze lead information and historical sales data to identify leads most likely to buy, freeing up time to focus on ideal buyers. LLM-powered sales engagement tools then allow the seller to auto-generate cold outreach emails. The natural result of AI integrations like this one is that workers get more done in less time, allowing them either to take more time for themselves or do more impactful, high-level work.\n\nCreation of New Job Opportunities\n\nThe invention of the tractor changed farm labor forever. Many manual labor farming jobs were lost to efficient machines, but new jobs and industries were created\u2014including manufacturing jobs to build and maintain the machinery, food processing plants, and large-scale grocery stores, all of which needed employees.\n\nThe advancement of artificial intelligence should do the same, opening doors to new careers and ways of making a living. Already we\u2019re seeing new job titles\u2014for example, prompt engineers to input text into LLMs to get desired outputs\u2014and soon we might see AI integration specialists to help organizations adopt and implement AI technology.\n\nMore Engaged and Focused Work\n\nWith AI taking care of the administrative tasks, workers will have more time for creative, strategic, or social work that AI can\u2019t do, such as designing new branding strategies or attending more networking events to meet investors and customers. This should improve job satisfaction, as people are creating real value rather than doing repetitive tasks. It\u2019s also not hard to imagine a world where, with all the productivity gains, people are free to spend more time outside of work with their families and friends, hobbies, and creative or intellectual pursuits.\n\nPreparing for an AI-Dominated Workforce\n\nThroughout history, those who\u2019ve embraced new technologies have thrived in the new economies they\u2019ve created, while those who ignore new developments have fallen behind in efficiency by being left unable to match the competition. Here are some ways to prepare yourself to use AI as an opportunity to become a stronger worker:\n\nEngage in Upskilling and Continuous Learning: New skills\u2014including soft skills like leadership and the ability to work with AI tools\u2014will become increasingly valuable. Take online courses, obtain an AI certification, and continue gaining new skills that are needed in your field.\n\nNew skills\u2014including soft skills like leadership and the ability to work with AI tools\u2014will become increasingly valuable. Take online courses, obtain an AI certification, and continue gaining new skills that are needed in your field. Develop AI-Complimentary Skills: Learn AI automation, communication, fact-checking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and other skills that will help you direct and use AI tools to their full potential. This will increase your efficiency and make you a more valuable employee.\n\nLearn AI automation, communication, fact-checking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and other skills that will help you direct and use AI tools to their full potential. This will increase your efficiency and make you a more valuable employee. Think of AI as an Augmentation Tool: Use AI to handle parts of your job that are routine or frustrating and focus on work that requires human ingenuity. For example, copywriters might use AI to brainstorm 10 headlines for a blog post and then use their knowledge of copywriting and psychology to select the best one.\n\nUse AI to handle parts of your job that are routine or frustrating and focus on work that requires human ingenuity. For example, copywriters might use AI to brainstorm 10 headlines for a blog post and then use their knowledge of copywriting and psychology to select the best one. Stay Informed About Regulatory Changes: More than half of the YouGov respondents believe AI should be regulated, with 56 percent supporting government oversight in the workplace. This growing support underscores the importance of staying informed about these regulations, as new rules might impact your industry.\n\nLearn to use AI to improve the quality of your work, and new opportunities will present themselves to you during this time of technological change.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWill AI Replace My Job?\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that a person using AI will replace you than that AI itself will. A person using AI may replace you if they are more efficient and productive because of their mastery of the tool. It\u2019s critical to familiarize yourself with the AI tools in your field to stay on the cutting edge.\n\nWill AI Ever Replace Doctors?\n\nAI is unlikely to ever replace doctors, since doctors do things AI can never do, like comfort patients and build relationships. However, the technology should help doctors with various parts of their job, from diagnosing patients with AI imaging to performing operations with robotic tools.\n\nWhat Jobs May Not Exist in 10 Years?\n\nJobs that consist primarily of rote and repetitive tasks are most likely to disappear in the next 10 years.\n\nBottom Line: Will AI Replace Humans?\n\nArtificial intelligence is not going to replace humans in the labor market, but as it evolves, it\u2019s likely to become increasingly merged into our workflows, from marketers using generative AI to help create content to teachers relying on machine learning to spot gaps in student knowledge. Going forward, the best way to protect your value as a worker is to learn to use these tools to your advantage.\n\nRead our guide to the top generative AI tools to find software to help you create content and build your career.",

        "text": "(NewsNation) \u2014 The U.S. is leading the world in artificial intelligence innovation and that could have serious implications for American workers.\n\nCognitive tasks once limited to humans \u2014 reading, writing, synthesizing information \u2014 can now be done more efficiently with generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini; companies have taken notice.\n\nMicrosoft dubbed 2024 \u201cthe year AI at work gets real\u201d and said the tech is already being \u201cwoven into the workplace at an unexpected scale.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, nearly 60% of companies have implemented software, equipment, or technology to automate tasks previously completed by employees, according to a survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates that \u201croughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation.\u201d The technological changes have been so swift that now some wonder if \u201clearn to code\u201d is bad advice.\n\nAI optimists argue it will make workers more productive and allow them to spend extra time on meaningful tasks. Others warn AI could cause some jobs to disappear completely. The truth may be somewhere in between.\n\n\u201cYou may not be replaced by AI but you could be replaced by somebody who knows how to use AI,\u201d said Allison Shrivastava, an associate economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the future of AI and which skills to prioritize going forward.\n\nWhich jobs are \u2018at risk\u2019 to AI automation and why?\n\nFor decades automation was mainly a blue-collar concern but generative AI is expected to have a greater impact on white-collar jobs, particularly administrative roles.\n\nThat\u2019s because AI can process large amounts of data accurately and efficiently. It\u2019s a shift that\u2019s likely to change jobs centered around data entry and email sorting.\n\n\u201cMost of the industries that face the greatest exposure to generative AI today are those that just a few years ago were ranked at the bottom of automation risk,\u201d the Brookings Institution noted in a recent report.\n\nBrookings said more than 30% of all workers could see at least 50% of their occupation\u2019s tasks disrupted by generative AI. Tasks in office and administrative support roles \u2014 bookkeepers, customer service representatives, office clerks \u2014 are especially likely to be automated.\n\nOther professions like insurance underwriters, tax preparers and legal secretaries also face high automation risk, according to the report.\n\nKeep in mind: jobs that are \u201cat risk\u201d for automation aren\u2019t necessarily going to disappear completely. In many cases, disruption doesn\u2019t mean destruction \u2014 roles will still exist except certain tasks will be done by AI.\n\nWith that said, several jobs are projected to decline over the next decade. Typists, data entry keyers and telemarketers are among the fastest-shrinking occupations, according to the latest Labor Department estimates.\n\nCashiers are also expected to be much less common by 2033, with employment projected to drop by 353,000 \u2014 the biggest total decline across all job categories, according to the Labor Department. Employment of customer service representatives and office clerks is forecasted to drop by 150,000 jobs each over the next decade.\n\nMeanwhile, jobs that require a significant social or emotional component are less likely to be replaced by AI. The healthcare and social assistance sector is set to boom, with nurse practitioners and physician assistants expected to be two of the fastest-growing jobs through 2033.\n\nOther hands-on roles like barbers, firefighters and child care workers also have low AI exposure, a Pew Research report found.\n\nWill AI replace jobs or make them better?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to know the full extent of AI\u2019s impact on jobs but many workers \u2014 and experts \u2014 are hopeful.\n\nThe optimistic view is that AI will automate the tasks nobody wants to do, freeing up employees to do work they enjoy.\n\nTeachers could spend less time writing lesson plans and more time working with students. Nurses may be able to get through paperwork faster and provide more care to patients.\n\nAs Ryan Rolanski, the CEO of LinkedIn, wrote in Wired earlier this year: \u201c(AI) doesn\u2019t replace people, it allows them to do their job more effectively, leaving them time to focus on the more valuable \u2014 and more human \u2014 parts of their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe AI revolution will also create entirely new jobs. There will be AI trainers who help develop the tools, along with AI prompt gurus who specialize in producing new types of content.\n\nOthers, like Michael Strain at the American Enterprise Institute, point out that AI will help many workers become more productive, making them more valuable to businesses. In turn, wages could rise.\n\nThere\u2019s also a potential labor shortage to consider. The American workforce is getting older and fewer people are having children.\n\nAdults ages 65 and older are projected to be 8.6% of the labor force in 2032, up from 5.2% in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. AI could help fill the productivity gap as more workers age out of the labor force.\n\nA recent global survey from Google and Ipsos found that most people (68%) who have used an AI application in the past year are excited about the possibilities. Of those, 63% of workers believed that in 25 years AI will have a positive impact on work-life balance.\n\nHow can workers prepare for AI at work?\n\nExperts suggest workers should start learning how to use generative AI tools, many of which are free. Workers who can take advantage of AI at their jobs now will have a leg up in the future.\n\nShrivastava recommends practicing writing ChatGPT prompts and understanding how the chatbot interprets those prompts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more difficult than you would initially think and that\u2019s definitely a huge skill to practice,\u201d she said.\n\nFor many employers, the AI future is already here. The share of job postings mentioning GenAI or related terms has skyrocketed over the past year, up 3.5 times in the U.S., according to research from the Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\nA recent Google Workspace study of \u201cyoung leaders,\u201d ages 22 to 39, found 82% are already leveraging AI tools in their work. The report was based on a survey of over 1,000 U.S.-based knowledge workers who aspire to hold a leadership position.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s also worth improving the so-called soft skills that generative AI can\u2019t replace. Interpersonal skills like emotional intelligence, teamwork and leadership are likely to become more important, not less.\n\n\u201cThose are really invaluable, and they\u2019re not going to be replaced anytime soon,\u201d Shrivastava said.",

        "text": "As college seniors refine their applications in hopes of entering the workforce in the coming months, they must confront a growing threat: Artificial intelligence is taking over the hiring process.\n\nSince the advent of ChatGPT and the artificial intelligence tech race, up to 42% of employers have begun using AI in the hiring process to improve recruiting. This may entail AI screening resumes, selecting candidates, and analyzing body language and vocal inflections in video interviews, according to the BBC.\n\nMost Americans do not find this prospect promising. According to a 2023 Pew Research study, 71% of U.S. adults oppose AI making final hiring decisions, and 41% oppose the use of AI in reviewing job applications.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT and similar programs are a result of decades of prior AI development. Just like any other technology, AI evolved over years, gradually embedding itself into our daily lives, including the workforce and hiring process.\n\nGoogle and LinkedIn, the sites most commonly associated with online job-searching and application, have used AI for almost as long as the sites themselves have existed. Google began using machine learning in 2001 to help its systems understand spelling mistakes. The company now uses AI for everything from helping with Google Translate to providing comprehensive results to search queries. LinkedIn began using AI around 2006 to develop its \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d function, an algorithm which connects people according to their interests, thus solidifying AI\u2019s indirect influence over the online hiring process, according to Forbes.\n\nAI is not new to the hiring process, and it\u2019s here to stay. However, we ought to be cautious about AI replacing a crucial aspect of every hiring process: human judgement.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts emphasized this problem in his 2023 End of Year Report, in which he related the problem of artificial determinations to the U.S. judicial system \u2014 where human judgment matters the most.\n\n\u201cMachines cannot fully replace key actors in court,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cNuance matters: Much can turn on a shaking hand, a quivering voice, a change of inflection, a bead of sweat, a moment\u2019s hesitation, a fleeting break in eye contact.\u201d\n\nRoberts concluded most people still trust human judgment to \u201cdraw the right inferences\u201d from small clues in human interaction that machines might not pick up on.\n\nThe same holds true for the hiring process. Any machine can gargle up and organize information based on the order of degrees, experience, or even the number of typos in a resume. A more sophisticated machine might even analyze body language and vocal inflection to make hiring decisions\n\nBut the hiring process is severely limited if it runs solely on data and algorithms. While convenient, letting a machine decide which candidates advance based solely on resume data, analysis, and raw numbers ignores crucial nuance about a person that cannot necessarily be captured on paper. This may result, for instance, in bad candidates with impressive resumes being favored while better-fit candidates with more modest resumes are rejected without either receiving face-to-face evaluations.\n\nIn-person interviews level the playing field of the hiring process. While resumes and data can give certain job candidates an edge, there remains a fundamentally human element of evaluating a person\u2019s job fitness that AI can never replace.\n\nAn employer with virtue, perspective, and intuition can pick the right person for a job far better than the most sophisticated machine because machines cannot understand people by any metric beyond its own data. AI cannot base its judgement on any human experience or perspective of its own. Any attempt to run a hiring process without these necessities has failed from the start.\n\nIn the end, nothing can fully evaluate a person as well as another person. While one can generally accept AI as a result of our increasingly technological world, we must still hold the line by keeping AI\u2019s role in the hiring process to a bare minimum. Leave the business of hiring people to people alone.\n\nElijah Guevara is a freshman studying the liberal arts.",

        "text": "The rapid development and rollout of artificial intelligence technology is set to fundamentally reshape virtually all aspects of life \u2013 but workplaces could be among the first to see dramatic change.\n\nA leading expert in technology has offered a forecast on the professions that may soon no longer exist, at least in a way that will require the services of a human employee.\n\nLast year, the World Economic Forum released a staggering report that warned some 26 million jobs will be wiped out by AI technology over the coming three years.\n\nNiusha Shafiabady, an associate professor of computational intelligence at the Australian Catholic University\u2019s Peter Faber Business School, has modelled the jobs most likely to be disrupted in the top three industries in the sights of AI.\n\nThey are education and health services, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality.\n\nJobs on the chopping block\n\nIn the education space, those working in an secretarial role at schools and universities could be replaced \u201crelatively quickly\u201d by AI, Dr Shafiabady said.\n\nLibrarians are also at risk, as are specialists who teach extra-curricular pursuits, such as music.\n\n4 Jobs in education are at risk. Alamy Stock Photo\n\n\u201cThey can be done programmatically with a computer with a camera. If you are a parent and are taking your kid for music lessons after school, you know the hassles involved in a 30-minute music lesson. If you have an alternative for this, you will probably take it.\n\n\u201cA computer program that shows your kid how to play and teaches them every principle that a music teacher shows them, and at the same time corrects them when they are practicing, will be easier and possibly cheaper to use.\u201d\n\nAI could see librarians become obsolete, with their tasks \u2013 managing the borrowing and release of materials, providing advice on helpful resources, and even surpassing human insights with an instant encyclopaedic knowledge of the world \u2013 easily replicated by AI.\n\n\u201cThe obvious choice for the jobs in the health services space is a clinic receptionist\u2019s role, which can be done by programs and computers in a much cheaper and hassle-free manner,\u201d Dr Shafiabady said.\n\n4 Drive-throughs are switching to AI operated ordering systems. Getty Images\n\nBut more than that, the roles of dietitian, speech therapist and even personal fitness trainer are at risk, she said.\n\n\u201cAll these tasks can be done by a computer with a camera, given by an intelligent program, and the same principles given in the music teacher example applied to them.\u201d\n\nIn the professional and business services space, customer service representatives and fast food workers are most at risk, as are those working in sales.\n\nAcross the United States, major fast food chains are already piloting the use of AI in drive-throughs, replacing humans with verbal chat bots that can quickly and accurately take orders.\n\nLocal experts have previously said it\u2019s only a matter of time until similar technology is adopted in Australia.\n\nKeep up with today's most important news Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.

Check out more newsletters\n\nAnother job at risk is that of a public relations professional, she said.\n\n\u201cAI algorithms have the capability to replicate these tasks. For example, a public relations representative manages communications and promotes the public image of the organisation.\n\n\u201cAI algorithms can look at these through the inputs they receive and objectively aim [at] different groups to promote an organisation or a client.\n\n\u201cThe same principle applies to a sales representative that targets the public. An AI program knows everyone\u2019s preferences better than a human if it has access to the [customer\u2019s] history of their activities, so it will be able to target the people for product sales in a smart manner.\u201d\n\n4 Travel agents could be obsolete thanks to AI. Getty Images\n\nFinally, in the leisure and hospitality industries, hotel concierges are likely to become a thing of the past, with AI able to replicate the vast majority of tasks.\n\nWant advice on where to go for dinner in a city you\u2019re visiting? Keen to get tickets for a theatre show? Lost your bearings and want some easy directions? An AI-powered kiosk, or even a human-looking robot, could do all of that \u2013 and more.\n\nTravel agents have already been significantly disrupted in the internet age, with simple and free booking portals as well as shopping direct becoming the norm over the past few decades.\n\nThe use of AI will only speed up the significant displacement of that job, Dr Shafiabady said.\n\nLikewise, the role of an event planner could soon become obsolete.\n\n\u201cA computer program that has access to the data related to all these roles can retrieve the information, process it and make decisions based on people\u2019s priorities faster or sometimes better than a human.\u201d\n\nThose working in industries or roles that are most likely to be impacted by AI should start thinking about how to mitigate the risks now, she said.\n\n\u201cWe should start thinking strategically and learn the skills of the future to protect ourselves. Our ancestors have gone through these changes in history many times, for example during the industrial revolution. Now it is our turn to do the same.\u201d\n\nBroader impacts in the workplace\n\nEven if your profession looks to be safe \u2013 for a while, at least \u2013 AI will have broader impacts beyond replacing humans.\n\nA team of researchers from Massey University in New Zealand and The University of Queensland examined the rapid spread of AI in the human resources space.\n\nMore and more companies are turning to the technology to streamline and speed up their recruitment practices.\n\nThe automatic review of resumes submitted by applicants for open roles already occurs at scale.\n\nIn some cases, applications are filtered before they even reach a human, meaning those that the AI determines aren\u2019t up to scratch are instantly discarded.\n\nIn analysis for The Conversation, they wrote: \u201cAI in recruitment promises greater objectivity and efficiency during the hiring process by eliminating human biases and enhancing fairness and consistency in decision making.\n\n4 Human resource departments are also at risk for being taken over by AI. Getty Images\n\n\u201cBut our research shows AI can subtly \u2013 and at times overtly \u2013 heighten biases. And the involvement of HR professionals may worsen rather than alleviate these effects.\n\n\u201cThis challenges our belief that human oversight can contain and moderate AI.\u201d\n\nGiven that AI language sets are informed by human behaviour and communication, they already come with built-in biases.\n\n\u201cFor example, in countries with different lengths of military service for men and women, an AI might deduce gender based on service duration,\u201d the researchers offered.\n\nSo, even those roles that can\u2019t be replicated by technology can still be impacted in some way due to AI intervention in the very initial hiring phase.\n\nLots of reward with plenty of risk\n\nKylie Walker, chief executive of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, said there are plenty of potential benefits \u2013 but not without guardrails.\n\n\u201cGreater adoption of AI could see Australia\u2019s economy increase by $200 billion annually, but it is critical that robust measures are rapidly implemented to safeguard these areas and position Australia at the forefront of AI development,\u201d Ms Walker said.\n\n\u201cInvesting further in local AI innovations will simultaneously create new AI industries and jobs here in Australia and reduce our reliance on internationally developed and maintained systems.\u201d\n\nBut building public trust in AI will be a long and challenging process, experts say.\n\nResearch by The University of Queensland and consulting firm KMPG found two-thirds of people are either unwilling to trust AI or ambivalent about its use.\n\n\u201cHowever, trust and acceptance depend on the AI application,\u201d the report noted.\n\n\u201cFor example, AI use in healthcare is more trusted than AI use for Human Resource purposes. People tend to have faith in the capability and helpfulness of AI systems, but are more sceptical of their safety, security, and fairness.\n\n\u201cMany people feel ambivalent about the use of AI, reporting optimism and excitement, coupled with fear and worry.\u201d\n\nErica Mealy, a lecturer in computer science at the University of the Sunshine Coast, said people are right to be nervous.\n\n\u201cAI systems are trained on incomprehensibly large data sets using advanced mathematics most people don\u2019t understand,\u201d Dr Mealy explained in analysis for The Conversation.\n\n\u201cThey produce results we have no way of verifying. Even flagship, state-of-the-art systems produce output riddled with errors.\n\n\u201cChatGPT appears to be growing less accurate over time. Even at its best it can\u2019t tell you what letters are in the word \u2018strawberry\u2019. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot has recommended putting glue on pizza, among other comical failures.\u201d\n\nLast month, the Federal Government released its voluntary AI safety standards alongside a discussion paper calling for greater regulation of the technology\n\nIn doing so, Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic declared: \u201cWe need more people to use AI and to do that we need to build trust.\u201d\n\nDr Mealy criticized the stance given the valid public wariness.\n\n\u201cThe case for using more of it seems quite weak \u2013 and also potentially dangerous,\u201d she said.\n\nAside from the risks, ranging from security to basic safety, Dr Mealy said the government\u2019s own research showed AI\u2019s promises were far from being fulfilled.\n\nThat research showed \u201chumans are more effective, efficient and productive than AI\u201d, she said, calling for proponents to \u201cdial down the blind hope\u201d.",

        "text": "Dismissed workers packing their belongings and leaving the office (\u00a9 StockPhotoPro - stock.adobe.com)\n\nCAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom \u2014 The question of how AI will reshape the workforce has long been a topic of speculation. Now, a new study provides new insights into the types of occupations that may be most impacted by AI technologies. Researchers from Nokia Bell Labs have developed a novel approach to assess AI\u2019s potential impact on various occupations in the United States. Their findings, published in PNAS Nexus, reveal that AI\u2019s reach extends beyond routine tasks, potentially affecting a wide range of professions, including those traditionally considered safe from automation. (Full list at end of article) The study introduces a new measure called the Artificial Intelligence Impact (AII) score, which gauges how closely an occupation\u2019s tasks align with recent AI innovations. By analyzing over 24,000 AI-related patents filed between 2015 and 2022, the researchers were able to identify which occupations might be most affected by emerging AI technologies.\n\nSurprisingly, some of the occupations with the highest AII scores were white-collar jobs requiring advanced education and specialized skills. Topping the list were cardiovascular technologists and technicians, sound engineering technicians, and nuclear medicine technologists. Other high-scoring occupations included air traffic controllers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologists, and even neurologists. This finding challenges the common belief that AI primarily threatens routine, low-skilled jobs. Instead, the study suggests that AI\u2019s impact may be more closely tied to specific skills within occupations, regardless of whether those skills are considered routine or non-routine. For example, in healthcare, the study found that 60% of tasks performed by cardiovascular technologists and 48% of those done by MRI technologists could potentially be impacted by AI. Patents related to automating health records management and analyzing medical scans were particularly relevant to these professions.\n\nSome high-scoring occupations affected by emerging AI included air traffic controllers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologists, and even neurologists. (Photo by Phonlamai Photo on Shutterstock)\n\nIn the information technology sector, 47% of software developers\u2019 tasks and 40% of computer programmers\u2019 tasks were found to align closely with recent AI patents. These patents focused on automating programming tasks and developing workflows, suggesting that even highly skilled tech jobs may not be immune to AI\u2019s influence. The manufacturing sector also showed significant potential for AI impact. The study found that 45% of tasks performed by industrial truck and tractor operators and 40% of earth drillers\u2019 tasks aligned with recent AI patents. These patents covered areas such as automated planning for water-well drilling rigs and the operation of electric-powered trucks. However, the researchers emphasize that a high AII score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean these jobs will disappear. In many cases, AI is more likely to augment human capabilities rather than replace workers entirely. For instance, while AI might automate certain aspects of a neurologist\u2019s job, such as analyzing brain scans, it\u2019s unlikely to replicate the complex decision-making and patient interaction skills that are crucial to the profession.\n\nThe study also identified occupations least likely to be impacted by AI in the near future. These tended to be blue-collar jobs requiring physical labor or manual dexterity, such as pile driver operators, dredge operators, and aircraft cargo handling supervisors. Jobs in construction, accommodation and food services, and certain managerial positions also showed low AII scores. Interestingly, the researchers found a positive correlation between an industry\u2019s AII score and its job vacancy rates. This suggests that sectors potentially most impacted by AI, such as healthcare and information technology, are also experiencing labor shortages. This dynamic could mean that AI adoption in these fields may help address workforce gaps rather than lead to widespread job losses. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on the job market will likely be complex and multifaceted. While some tasks within occupations may be automated, new roles and responsibilities may also emerge. The key for workers and policymakers will be to adapt to these changes, focusing on skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.\n\nTop 20 occupations with the highest levels of AI vulnerability Cardiovascular Technologists and Technicians Sound Engineering Technicians Nuclear Medicine Technologists Air Traffic Controllers Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologists Electro-Mechanical and Mechatronics Technologists and Technicians Orthodontists Power Distributors and Dispatchers Neurologists Industrial Truck and Tractor Operators Public Safety Telecommunicators Computer Numerically Controlled Tool Programmers Security Guards Remote Sensing Scientists and Technologists Machinists Radiologists Atmospheric and Space Scientists Computer Numerically Controlled Tool Operators Textile Knitting and Weaving Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders Medical Transcriptionists Top 20 occupations with the lowest levels of AI vulnerability Pile Driver Operators Dredge Operators Aircraft Cargo Handling Supervisors Graders and Sorters, Agricultural Products Insurance Underwriters Floor Sanders and Finishers Reinforcing Iron and Rebar Workers Farm Labor Contractors Administrative Services Managers Rock Splitters, Quarry Brokerage Clerks Podiatrists Helpers\u2013Painters, Paperhangers, Plasterers, and Stucco Masons Shipping, Receiving, and Inventory Clerks Cooks, Short Order Team Assemblers Proofreaders and Copy Markers Butchers and Meat Cutters Door-to-Door Sales Workers, News and Street Vendors, and Related Workers Segmental Pavers",

        "text": "It\u2019s no longer a hypothetical question. Has AI begun to replace human jobs? Recent headlines suggest that the answer is yes\u2014and it\u2019s happening faster and more quietly than we might think. According to The New York Times, some companies are employing a practice known as \u2018silent firing\u2019, making roles so unbearable that employees quit, only to be replaced by AI. No need for layoffs or pink slips\u2014just let the machines slip in and quietly take over.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not limited to one sector or role. Amazon\u2019s recent push to get employees back to the office five days a week, despite widespread dissatisfaction, is more than just a mandate for in-person collaboration. George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.AI, argues it\u2019s a strategic move to filter out anyone unwilling to adapt to Amazon\u2019s rigid expectations as they push further into automation. Fewer complaints, fewer workers, more robots\u2014Amazon\u2019s formula for \u2018efficiency\u2019.\n\nGoogle, another tech giant, is also quietly marching toward an automated future. CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that over a quarter of new code at Google is generated by AI. Engineers review and approve the work, sure, but the message is clear: the machines are now producing work that humans used to do. And, not surprisingly, Google has reduced its workforce by over a thousand employees in the past year. As productivity goes up, headcounts go down.\n\nEven in India, automation has crept into the aviation industry, with Indigo Airlines\u2019 automated check-in stations at Delhi airport making it clear that front-line jobs are at risk. This isn\u2019t a preview of a futuristic landscape\u2014it\u2019s the reality unfolding right now.\n\nThe experts speak, but do they really get it?\n\nOf course, the naysayers insist we\u2019re overreacting. Economist Daron Acemoglu of MIT claims that AI will only be able to replace 5 per cent of jobs within the next decade. He assures us that AI isn\u2019t advanced enough to replicate the complexity of human tasks and that the technology is still dependent on human oversight. According to him, we\u2019re decades away from a meaningful economic revolution driven by AI. But is that optimism, or just an inability to see the ground shifting beneath our feet?\n\nAcemoglu\u2019s argument misses the point: AI doesn\u2019t need to replace all jobs to reshape the job market fundamentally. Incremental replacement has already begun, and with every task that shifts to AI, companies become less reliant on human skills. He might claim it\u2019s just a 5 per cent shift, but that\u2019s still millions of workers forced to confront an unsettling truth: the machines are nibbling at the edges of our careers, and they\u2019re not stopping.\n\nAI and the new anxiety: The invisible toll on human workers\n\nIt\u2019s not just jobs on the line; it\u2019s the emotional toll on workers. A survey by Oracle recently revealed that 51 per cent of employees worry AI will make their skills obsolete, leaving them feeling anxious, threatened, and psychologically unmoored. This isn\u2019t idle paranoia. When AI quietly takes over roles or parts of roles, employees are left feeling devalued. They wonder if their unique skills\u2014things they once took pride in\u2014are still valuable in a world where algorithms can perform data analysis, generate content, and execute tasks with cold, calculated precision.\n\nAnd yet, as AI proliferates, transparency is nowhere to be found. In that same survey, over half of the employees polled said they had no idea how their companies were actually using AI. That opacity breeds fear and uncertainty. Workers are more likely to jump to conclusions about their job security, while executives reap the benefits of AI-driven productivity without addressing the impact on their workforce\u2019s morale or well-being.\n\nWhen you keep workers in the dark, anxiety and burnout skyrocket. It\u2019s a toxic cocktail: employees who feel undervalued and disconnected from their organisation\u2019s goals are more likely to experience job dissatisfaction, depression, and mental exhaustion. This isn\u2019t the result of human limitations; it\u2019s a direct consequence of how companies choose to wield technology.\n\nWhy the real problem isn\u2019t AI, but how companies use it\n\nHere\u2019s the hard truth: AI is a tool, not a replacement. It may be able to churn out code or perform basic data analysis, but it lacks the essential qualities that make humans irreplaceable\u2014intuition, empathy, creativity, and ethical reasoning. Machines can follow patterns, but they cannot innovate or solve complex problems in novel ways. That\u2019s where humans still hold the advantage, and that\u2019s the strength companies should be investing in.\n\nYet most companies don\u2019t see it this way. Rather than viewing AI as a tool to enhance human potential, they\u2019re treating it as a way to cut costs, reduce headcount, and drive \u2018efficiency.\u2019 It\u2019s a short-sighted strategy that risks undermining their greatest asset: a skilled, motivated, and engaged workforce. Instead of empowering employees to use AI as a complement to their skills, organisations are leaving them to wonder when they\u2019ll be quietly shown the door.\n\nThe solution is transparency and collaboration, not competition. Companies that are genuinely interested in long-term success should communicate openly with employees about AI\u2019s role in the workplace. Provide training on how to leverage AI as a productivity tool, rather than letting fear take hold. Equip workers to see AI as an asset that enhances their work, not as a spectre lurking in the background, waiting to make them redundant.\n\nAI and human workers: A partnership or a power struggle?\n\nSo, where do we go from here? The question isn\u2019t just whether AI will replace us, but whether we\u2019ll allow it to reshape the workplace at the expense of human talent. AI should be a tool that frees humans to tackle complex, creative challenges, not a weapon used to thin the ranks.\n\nIn the end, the fate of AI in the workplace will depend on how companies choose to wield it. If they continue to prioritise short-term gains over long-term sustainability, we will see a workforce driven by fear, demoralised, and ultimately less productive. But if they recognise the unique qualities humans bring\u2014qualities that AI will never replicate\u2014then the future of work could look very different.\n\nThe truth is, AI is here to stay. It will transform industries, reshape roles, and challenge us to adapt. But whether it becomes a force for human advancement or a quiet destroyer of livelihoods depends on one thing: our willingness to see machines as partners, not replacements. Let AI handle the routine, the repetitive, and the mundane\u2014but let humans continue to dream, innovate, and lead. The future of work is not an either-or scenario. It\u2019s about finding balance, purpose, and, above all, valuing what makes us irreplaceably human.",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping the workforce, and according to Bill Gates, this is just the beginning! The Microsoft co-founder believes that AI will wipe out most jobs and completely transform the global economy. But who will survive this technological revolution? Good news\u2014three professions seem safe from this massive extinction\u2026 for now.\n\nWill AI Replace Us? Bill Gates Predicts a 3-Day Work Week\n\nIf Bill Gates is right, artificial intelligence will automate so many tasks that our workweek could shrink to just three days. No more 40-hour weeks stuck in an office! A tempting vision\u2026 except for those who lose their jobs in the process. And there will be many.\n\nBut all is not lost! According to Gates, three professions should resist automation. If you work in one of these fields, you can breathe easy (for now).\n\nThe 3 Jobs That Will Survive AI\n\n1. Coders: AI Still Needs Its Creators\n\nYou might think programmers are at the top of the endangered jobs list. Wrong! While AI can already generate code, it is far from perfect. Humans will still be needed to monitor it, fix its mistakes, and most importantly, design even more advanced systems.\n\nIn short, AI needs humans\u2026 to create AI! Ironic, isn\u2019t it?\n\n2. Energy Experts: A Field Too Complex for AI\n\nOil, nuclear, renewable energy\u2026 This sector is too strategic and complicated to be handed over entirely to machines. Engineers, researchers, and technicians will always be needed to manage infrastructure, understand industry challenges, and innovate.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest\u2014no one wants an AI making critical energy decisions without human oversight, right?\n\n3. Biologists (But There\u2019s a Catch\u2026)\n\nThis one is tricky. AI can already diagnose diseases, analyze DNA sequences, and even detect illnesses better than doctors. So why does Bill Gates believe biology will survive AI?\n\nBecause, according to him, the real problem isn\u2019t AI\u2014it\u2019s the lack of demand! Less funding, fewer opportunities\u2026 but humans will still be needed to drive genetic research and biotechnology forward.\n\nThe Future of Work: Adapt or Disappear?\n\nEven Bill Gates admits: he could be wrong. But one thing is certain\u2014AI is here to stay. Learning to work with AI instead of fearing it is the key to staying ahead.\n\nAnd for those not in these three \u201csafe\u201d fields? It might be time to retrain.\n\nThe Future of AI: More Powerful\u2026 and Self-Aware?\n\nBill Gates is clear\u2014generative AI as we know it today (like ChatGPT) will soon become obsolete. He\u2019s looking ahead. He envisions a self-aware AI, capable of thinking and learning like a human.\n\nAn AI that could turn us into superhumans, making us smarter, more efficient, and possibly even immortal\u2026 Science fiction or an imminent reality?\n\nReady for the Future or Headed for Obsolescence?\n\nUntil we find out if Bill Gates is right, one thing is certain\u2014AI isn\u2019t going anywhere. So, are you in one of the safe professions, or is it time for a career change?\n\nTell us in the comments: Is your job at risk from AI?",

        "text": "If you like this article, share it with your friends.\n\nAt 45, Simon Lee says he\u2019s heard predictions about robots and technology replacing our jobs since childhood. Here\u2019s why that is not going to happen.\n\nIn recent months, AI fanatics have been vocal about how AI will replace our jobs, particularly in technology, service sectors, and outsourcing. Some even predict AI will render outsourcing obsolete by eliminating the need for remote teams.\n\nThis simply won\u2019t happen. While I do believe AI will help people costs grow more sustainably and improve service offerings; here\u2019s why it won\u2019t replace your jobs or the need for remote teams (outsourcing).\n\nLess than 20% of the global population lives in developed countries\n\nThe majority of the global population lives in developing nations where GDP growth averages between 3-8%. However, over the past 20 years, developing countries have grown at an average rate of around 5%, compared to just 1-3% in developed countries.\n\nAs countries develop, the cost of providing services increases, driving demand for outsourcing to reduce overheads. This has fueled the growth of business process outsourcing (BPO) and IT services outsourcing, both of which are crucial to balancing service costs for developed nations.\n\nIn 2023, the global BPO market was valued at $280.64 billion and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% through 2030. Similarly, the IT services outsourcing market, valued at $639.59 billion in 2022, is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 8.0% over the same period. By 2030, these sectors are projected to collectively reach over $1.6 trillion, nearly doubling their market size. This rapid expansion, however, may not be sustainable, with the industry doubling every eight years. Ideally, growth should slow to around 5%, in line with the GDP growth of developing nations, to ensure stability.\n\nAs more countries transition to developed economies and existing developed nations shift towards knowledge-based work, demand for services will continue to rise. Despite technological advancements, the need for human expertise in services remains high.\n\nI believe AI will be essential in supporting emerging economies. Without AI, maintaining affordable services in a world where 50% of the population is classified as developed would be unsustainable. AI must be leveraged to keep costs low while enabling these transitioning markets to thrive, however, it won\u2019t wipe out the need for human-driven services.\n\nSoftware development costs are out of control\n\nThe era of startups being built in garages has largely passed. Today, many startups require millions\u2014or even hundreds of millions\u2014of dollars to achieve profitability, often leaving founders with small equity stakes in their companies.\n\nSoftware development and developer salaries have nearly doubled in the past five years while the proliferation of programming languages further complicates tech development. While AI can assist a Node.js developer in working with .NET, it doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for coding expertise. Instead, AI simplifies the management of diverse programming languages, reducing costs associated with maintaining multi-language environments.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen junior developers become 25-30% more efficient while senior developers are 10-15% faster. This is not transferring to cost reductions, but simply allowing for more features to be shipped.\n\nAI will help lower the cost for more businesses to launch and become profitable and prevent the current global monopolies that exist today. AI can also play a key role in curbing these rising costs while ensuring sustained growth in outsourcing. But this will only result in more products being built that are too expensive to make under the current people cost constraints today\n\nAI is not delivering cost reductions. It\u2019s contributing to cost hikes and service improvements\n\nA recent RAND report showed that over 80% of AI projects fail. I think this is largely due to a misguided focus on replacing jobs/reducing costs, rather than measuring improved service quality.\n\nMoving forward, AI projects should be measured not by cost savings but by enhancements in service quality and customer satisfaction. I also believe many of the companies claiming to reduce staff due to AI (the 20%) are likely using this narrative to craft positive market stories and boost their share value.\n\nIn reality, these reductions are because of tough market conditions, where layoffs are inevitable. The investment vs staff reductions just doesn\u2019t add up. For instance, investing $1 million monthly in AI and automation would require replacing 500-1,000 remote jobs to be cost-neutral.\n\nAt Teamified, we\u2019ve harnessed AI, technology, and human expertise to cut hiring times by 50%. However, AI accounts for only 15% of this improvement, mainly by helping our recruiters better understand hiring managers\u2019 needs beyond basic job descriptions.\n\nWhile AI has enhanced service quality and speed, it has significantly increased costs due to the need for expensive developers to support AI platforms. Over time, we expect these costs to stabilise as we scale. For now, we have a much higher cost base to provide a better service.\n\nAt 45, I\u2019ve heard predictions about robots and technology replacing our jobs since childhood\n\nYes, not as many people work in factories anymore. Yet, since the 1980s, new roles like social media managers, influencers, sustainability managers, data scientists, cloud computing specialists, cybersecurity analysts, app developers, AI engineers, and blockchain developers have emerged. These jobs, created by advancements in technology and digitalisation, now support industries valued at over $8 trillion globally. The rapid evolution of these sectors continues to reshape the job market, and over the next 40 years, new jobs will emerge to replace any displaced by AI.\n\nI\u2019m really excited about AI\u2019s potential to democratise access to services traditionally reserved for the wealthy, such as legal, financial, and medical advice and more importantly, cheap access to specialised education. AI won\u2019t make these professions obsolete; instead, AI will make their services more accessible by offering preliminary advice and guidance, with human experts stepping in for more complex consultations.\n\nAs the global population becomes part of the developed world, the demand for these services will grow. Take 99designs for example. It made it easy and affordable to create a cool brand. Many thought traditional branding agencies would suffer, but instead, they flourished as people with newfound budgets invested more in their brands. I believe AI will have a similar effect, boosting industries more than it disrupts them.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI will enhance the quality, speed, and accessibility of services. While AI may slow the rapid growth of outsourcing to a more sustainable 5%, it will not replace people or the need for outsourcing in the foreseeable future.\n\nNever miss a story: sign up to SmartCompany\u2019s free daily newsletter and find our best stories on LinkedIn.",

        "text": "Technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), must be deflationary to have a macroeconomic impact. It can reduce costs and prices and boost real incomes and demand, thereby creating new jobs and offsetting automation-driven losses.\n\nPredictions of technological unemployment have repeatedly proven false, as macroeconomic job creation in new sectors offsets microeconomic disruptions.\n\nAI is likely to increase productivity and wealth, with new jobs emerging; the focus should be on managing sector-specific disruptions, not fearing labour market dystopia.\n\nIn 1983, Wassily Leontief, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, concluded that human labour would go the way of the horse after the automobile arrived \u2013 \u201cfirst diminished and then eliminated.\u201d\n\nToday, a new wave of doomsaying has emerged surrounding \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d as AI, with its promise of business innovation, has marched to the forefront of economic debate. Pundits argue we\u2019re now drifting towards a \u201cworld without work\u201d where machines produce all things and algorithms provide all services. Outclassed humans serve no role in this macroeconomic dystopia.\n\nAs we argue in Shocks, Crises, and False Alarms, predictions of technology-driven job destruction have a long history and correspondingly, a long record of failure. Angst about worker obsolescence ebbs and flows with each new generation of technology. The threat from automation was once deemed so dire that Bill Gates proposed a \u201crobot tax\u201d on companies choosing robots over human labour to soften the blow of its impact on workers.\n\nYet, amid relentless technological progress over the past 80 years, during which the labour market has been remade \u2013 and then remade again \u2013 the US economy has added 120 million jobs. In 2024, as the unemployment rate remains historically low and real wages are growing, few remember Gates\u2019 robot tax idea.\n\nThe deflationary nature of technology\n\nThough it remains a popular narrative today, the failed predictions of technological unemployment have not been lost on all economists. More upbeat assessments contend that AI will augment workers \u2013 perhaps the least-skilled ones \u2013 rather than replace them. Others argue that replacing workers is harder than it seems because jobs are collections of tasks and AI may not be able to do all of them seamlessly.\n\nSuch arguments are important and rooted in the microeconomics of work. However, macroeconomics offers the most persuasive arguments against mass unemployment in the face of AI.\n\nWhat is routinely overlooked is that technology is an inherently deflationary force. When it is broadly impactful, technology drives down costs and prices, pushing up consumers\u2019 real incomes and demand for new goods and services \u2013 and thus, new employment. A matter of logic more than luck, such rejuvenation of the labour market has occurred repeatedly.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful demonstration of technology\u2019s deflationary benefits has occurred with food. In the late 19th century, nearly half of all Americans worked on a farm and spent more than 40% of their disposable income on food. Over the subsequent 150 years, successive waves of innovation have left but roughly 1% of Americans working on farms. Food budgets, meanwhile, have fallen to roughly 12% of income.\n\nUS farm and non-farm employment and share of budget spent on food over the long run. Image: BCG\n\nLower prices deliver what economists call real income gains \u2013 consumers spend less and use the extra room in their budgets to increase consumption of, often new, goods and services, ultimately leading to new employment. Yes, the process has always come with sector-specific job losses and thus microeconomic pain but it has also served as a reliable route to new jobs and macroeconomic gain.\n\nWith such a record of failure, it may seem surprising that doomsayers cling to dystopian narratives of technological unemployment. But it is easier to spot technology-driven job losses, which are often concentrated and can happen fast than it is to discern new job creation, which is usually dispersed and happens over time.\n\n\u201c When it is broadly impactful, technology drives down costs and prices, pushing up consumers\u2019 real incomes and demand for new goods and services \u2013 and thus, new employment. \u201d \u2014 Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, Global Chief Economist, Boston Consulting Group | Paul Swartz, Executive Director, Senior Economist, Boston Consulting Group\n\nWill AI buck the trend?\n\nIf we scrutinize AI\u2019s promise along each step of the well-trodden path from new technology to new employment, it seems unlikely that AI will end a history of labour market rejuvenation and adjustment.\n\nCost reduction. AI is likely to succeed at replacing labour, particularly in services where digital technologies have struggled to do so in the past. Though the speed and size of this impact are AI is likely to succeed at replacing labour, particularly in services where digital technologies have struggled to do so in the past. Though the speed and size of this impact are likely to be more modest than many expect today , gradual and cumulatively significant cost reduction (and productivity growth) is a safe bet.\n\nFalling prices. Unless labour-saving technology can be monopolized, it will continue to drive cost competition and deflation. Far from being specific to food production, the effect has been seen in manufactured goods and now looks set to unfold in services. Policymakers may need to watch for and ensure competitive market structures to ensure that AI becomes a deflationary force in the economy.\n\nNew demand. Real income gains often drive demand for goods and services that were barely known when a new technological wave began (few would have foreseen the arrival of social media marketers a few decades ago). This demand effect could fall short if consumers retreat and save their income gains. However, the resulting savings glut seems unlikely and directly contradicts the historical record.\n\nNew employment. What if a machine or an algorithm can always meet new demand? That humans lose all comparative advantage seems remarkably unlikely. AI\u2019s labour-enhancing properties are as credible as its labour-eliminating ones. But even if Leontief\u2019s words turned out prescient and humans went \u201cthe way of the horse,\u201d that would hardly amount to a macroeconomic dystopia. Instead, the overwhelming deflationary impulse would lay the ground for unparalleled prosperity.\n\nThe impact of AI will be seen, experienced, and reported primarily through a microeconomic lens that magnifies the disruptions and gyrations that will come. That should not be conflated with the macroeconomic promise that AI holds. Mass technological unemployment remains an ahistorical and unlikely proposition. AI does come with important risks but pervasive joblessness should not top our list of concerns.\n\nA far more likely outcome is a gradual increase in productivity and wealth, punctuated by the microeconomic pain of any economic transformation. The world will not be without work but it will work differently.\n\nLoading...",

        "text": "A longtime writer and journalist might be the last person one would expect to embrace artificial intelligence, but that accurately describes Scott Rex\u2019s outlook on the matter.\n\n\u201cAI is a content production process, but it\u2019s not thinking yet.\u201d Rex says. \u201cWe want to teach students to use the AI engine to enhance their process by writing prompts that make the machine an aid to what the human is already doing.\n\n\n\nRex, an instructor of practice in marketing and the co-director of the Northwestern Mutual Data Science Institute, has a hard job. He has to incorporate AI into his classes in a way that grows students\u2019 proficiency but won\u2019t become obsolete or circumvent the learning process. Ultimately, his goal is to get students jobs in the short-term while cultivating a set of skills that can\u2019t be outsourced to AI for the long-term. To do that, Rex has incorporated data science and analytics into his toolkit.\n\nAugment, Replace, Create\n\nWhen Rex teaches artificial intelligence, he talks about the ARC process, which stands for Augment, Replace and Create. In phase one, a new technology builds upon the existing capacity of workers, allowing them to do their jobs easier and faster. In the second phase, it replaces those workers. In the final phase, it creates new job for upskilled workers.\n\nCompanies are looking for students skilled in artificial intelligence tools right now. However, Rex is cognizant that many businesses are looking to move to the \u201creplace\u201d phase. He is principally occupied with one question when designing his classes: how can students weather \u201creplace\u201d and move to \u201ccreate?\u201d\n\nHe sees the solution in Marquette\u2019s liberal arts core, which teaches students how to think, not what to think.\n\n\u201cLearning how to reason through a process with creativity and critical thought is paramount,\u201d Rex says. \u201cThe mental work you have to go through is the valuable part and you\u2019ll be shortchanging yourself if you focus on the product over the process.\u201d\n\n\n\nTraining on the right data\n\nMost of the public hype around artificial intelligence has come from large language models trained on data scraped from the internet. This will inevitably lead to original works being used for unauthorized purposes and possible legal claims of copyright infringement.\n\n\u201cAs a former journalist and writer, that\u2019s painful that my written work is going to be ingested to train an LLM that might be used by someone to try to replace me,\u201d Rex says.\n\nInstead, Rex sees greater value in training artificial intelligence on internal, proprietary data. Companies could feed data from their customer relationship management database into AI software and identify trends much faster and with greater accuracy than before.\n\n\u201cRetrieval-augmented generation AI is going to be huge in the next five years,\u201d Rex says. \u201cI may not particularly care what the whole internet has to say about something, but I want software that can query my own data to find connections.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Challenge Engine\n\nAnother role that AI might fill is that of the \u201cchallenge engine.\u201d Rex encourages his students to ask large language models to give them ideas on how to respond to a prompt, then do independent research on the ones that sound most promising.\n\nThis ensures the learning and critical thinking processes are still happening; they\u2019re just happening more quickly than they would have without AI.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence should open up different avenues of inquiry. In the past, you would have encountered things outside your frame of reference by serendipity; maybe in the library or through a random Google search. The value of AI is engineering those serendipitous moments and getting you on the right path more quickly,\u201d Rex says.",

        "text": "It\u2019s official\u2014AI is replacing Gen Z jobs, or it might soon enough. According to a new survey, 37% of managers would rather hire artificial intelligence bots over humans, or young Gen Z graduates to be more precise. While workers have long been afraid of technology taking over their jobs, especially since the AI uprising began a few years ago, most were reassured by the fact that the technology would take some more to develop into a form that would be able to do their jobs better than them.\n\nThey were right to a degree, as such advanced technology has not materialized yet, however, employers and hiring managers have already begun considering the possibility of AI replacing human jobs in 2025. The general attitude towards the Gen Z population has long been one of aversion, and this is materializing in a way that might be significantly detrimental to the incoming workforce.\n\nIs AI Replacing Gen Z Jobs? Not Yet but Managers Are Ready to Explore Their Options\n\nRecently, HR managers have begun expressing concerns over the dearth of talent in their organizations, with many pointing at their difficulties in finding qualified candidates who can take on their roles and mix with the organization\u2019s culture and practices. Now it appears that the problem has gotten to a point where they are actively considering AI robots over actual candidates.\n\nAccording to the study conducted by Workplace Intelligence and sponsored by Hult International Business School, 37% of employers would rather hire a robot or AI over a recent college graduate. When the reasoning for this was further explored, it was revealed that 96% of HR leaders believed that colleges were not preparing these young workers for the workplace to the degree that one might expect.\n\nAdditionally, 89% of the employers were making an active effort to avoid hiring these recent graduates precisely due to their lack of experience and skill. It\u2019s interesting to note that they weren\u2019t the only ones who felt that Gen Z workers were unprepared for the workforce.\n\nGen Zers Are Not Satisfied with their Workplace Preparedness Either\n\nThe study also collected data from recent college graduates themselves and the numbers showed that 77% of the Gen Z workers learned more in their first 6 months on the job compared to the learnings from their 4-year college course.\n\nAround 85% of them wished their colleges had prepared them better and 55% felt their college education did nothing to prepare them for their jobs. For an entire 87% of them, the on-the-job training was more useful than their entire undergraduate education.\n\nFrom the numbers, it appears that Gen Z\u2019s struggles have less to do with their own shortcomings and more to do with the current system of education. Many educational institutions have not been able to keep up with the times and update their offerings to the level that is necessary for the modern world.\n\nWhat are the Primary Issues that Managers Face With Gen Z Workers?\n\nWhen talking about Gen Z\u2019s workplace unpreparedness, there are a couple of different issues that lead the conversation. Managers complain that Gen Z workers do not have real-world experience, making them unable to apply themselves to the work. This one is a tricky problem because if colleges aren\u2019t preparing workers and these candidates aren\u2019t getting hired either, there is little room for them to gain experience or understand their roles better.\n\nGen Z workers have also been accused of lacking a global mindset or basic business etiquette. While it\u2019s true that a large number of these workers started or ended their education during the global pandemic, there has also been a mismatch between what employers and these workers consider \u201cprofessional.\u201d\n\nGen Z workers also struggle to work well in a team, which is a criticism that has been repeated quite often. Whether this is a mismatch between the generations or a real attitude problem, it falls to Gen Zers to address and resolve this issue if they want to get hired.\n\nOrganizations that have been willing to hire these Gen Zers also find it too expensive to invest in their training, which brings us back to the lack of necessary support for these young graduates.\n\nAI vs Gen Z in the Job Market\u2014Is There a Real Chance of Being Replaced?\n\nAI has evolved exponentially over the last two years and from the heavy investments that organizations are making into the technology, it is likely that these systems will only get better from here on out. AI is being integrated into HRIS systems and finding room in customer service roles as well.\n\nLooking at the big picture, employers hiring AI over humans expect that these tools will be significantly easier to work with, more cost-effective, and more efficient. If organizations are able to replace human jobs with AI, they likely will. There are multiple avenues where AI application is imminent, however, despite employers considering AI as a replacement for Gen Z jobs, there is still a way to go before this becomes possible.\n\nDespite this, employers are still holding off on hiring Gen Z candidates, with some even willing to fire them within 90 days on the job. Older workers may find themselves forced to fill these roles, despite their experience and desire to progress in their careers. This suggests that something needs to change.\n\nEmployers need to realistically assess whether AI tools have reached a point where they can replace Gen Z jobs already. For the most part, it has not, which means that the available jobs have to be handled by an individual. If candidates appear unprepared, employers will have to put their resources together and meet these candidates halfway to help them while they help themselves.\n\nAI could be replacing Gen Z jobs, so workers for their part, may benefit from seeking out mentors and advisors in their industry of interest and gaining some insight into how to prepare for the workforce. These workers can also consider familiarizing themselves with AI as they might be the ones best equipped to develop and use these AI tools.",

We are always running around \u2026 and just rushing for time,\u201d said the 25-year-old senior staff nurse, who works in a Singapore hospital.\n\nThe shortage of doctors and nurses in the region is well documented. In Java, Indonesia, for example, there are approximately only 22 medical specialists for every 100,000 residents, according to state news agency Antara.\n\nMeanwhile, Thailand reportedly sees up to 7,000 nurse resignations at state-run hospitals annually despite a yearly increase of 10,000 new nursing graduates.\n\nThe typical result is a heavier burden for healthcare workers who stay on as they hold the fort.\n\nThis is where artificial intelligence (AI) can lighten the load - and it\u2019s already being put into action, be it handling administrative tasks or expediting health screenings.\n\nBut even as AI shapes up to be a remedy for the overworked, concern is also growing over its rapid advance. A key worry often voiced is: \u201cWill AI steal our jobs?\u201d\n\nTo Mr Asyraaf, the answer is no. \u201cAI can never take over what we're doing because our work as nurses involves feelings; it involves a human touch. These are things that AI can never do,\u201d he stressed.",

        "text": "FOR SOME time now, we have been warned about the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the looming threat it poses to jobs and livelihoods worldwide. Although I wouldn\u2019t consider myself an expert in the field, others with significantly more experience than myself have written blogs, articles and white papers on the topic, while governments and tech billionaires have made grand speeches about AI\u2019s ability to transform work as we know it.\n\nBut for many of us, the looming AI threat has always felt like a distant storm. Something that might affect future generations but not our daily lives just yet. In other words, those are problems for our kids to solve one day. Well my friends, that storm is no longer on the horizon. Time to wake those kids up and put them to work.\n\nTHE DBS LAYOFF\n\nLast week, Singapore\u2019s largest bank, the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), announced plans to slash 4,000 jobs over the next three years, citing AI as the primary reason. According to its chief executive, Piyush Gupta, the bank has deployed over 800 AI models across 350 different areas of operation, significantly reducing the need for human workers. While DBS will be creating 1,000 new AI-related jobs, that still leaves a net loss of 3,000 positions, with contract and temporary workers bearing the brunt of the cuts.\n\nThis development at DBS, and the banking sector on a whole, is just the tip of the iceberg. A Bloomberg Intelligence report warns that global banks alone could cut 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years because of AI advancements. Let that sink in for a minute, just in case you think this is just a problem for Singapore, Europe, or the US.\n\nAI is already changing the landscape of work in Jamaica \u2013 we just haven\u2019t fully grasped it yet. More local companies are using AI chatbots instead of hiring customer service agents. Even the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, one of Jamaica\u2019s biggest employers, is starting to feel the heat, with AI automating call centre tasks that once required human workers.\n\nHeadlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner\u2019s morning and evening newsletters.\n\nAnd if AI can replace workers who need to get deeply creative in solving unique problems for customers, what happens to the thousands of Jamaicans working in data entry, law and education?\n\nTHE FIRST JOBS TO GO\n\nIf the DBS announcement teaches us anything, it\u2019s that AI is not just replacing low-skilled labour, it\u2019s coming for white-collar jobs too. While many people assume that AI will only impact manufacturing or retail jobs, studies suggest that computer-based roles are actually the most at risk. In Jamaica, that means bank tellers and customer service representatives at our biggest companies are at risk. AI-driven chatbots are already handling customer queries, and smart ATMs are reducing the need for tellers.\n\nThen there\u2019s the BPOs and call centres. Jamaica\u2019s BPO industry employs over 60,000 people, but AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants can now handle most routine customer inquiries. Some major BPO players have already scaling back hiring as AI becomes more capable.\n\nThen there are my friends who do legal and administrative work. AI can draft contracts, analyse legal documents, and even provide legal advice faster and cheaper than junior lawyers. Even basic administrative work, like scheduling and record-keeping, is being automated.\n\nAnd don\u2019t for one minute think that I\u2019m unaware of my vulnerability. Media and content creators should also be worried as AI can write news articles, marketing copy, and social media posts with surprising accuracy.\n\nWHAT CAN WE DO?\n\nSo, where does this leave us? Do we resign ourselves to a future where machines take over everything? Not at all. But we do need to wake up. The most dangerous thing we can do is pretend this isn\u2019t happening. AI is not a passing trend. It is fundamentally altering how work is done. And if we want to ensure that Jamaica doesn\u2019t get left behind, we need a strategy.\n\nWe need to first and foremost, reassess teaching children for jobs that won\u2019t exist in 10 years. The focus needs to shift from memorisation-based learning to critical thinking, adaptability, and digital skills. AI literacy should be mandatory in schools, and universities need to offer more courses in AI, cybersecurity, and data science.\n\nWe also need to start upskilling the workforce. If your job is data-heavy, repetitive, or computer-based, you need to start learning new skills now. AI isn\u2019t replacing everything. There are still fields where human creativity, emotional intelligence, and leadership are irreplaceable. Jobs in AI development, cybersecurity, and human-centred industries (healthcare, counselling, creative arts) will remain valuable. But those in data driven fields should be wary.\n\nAI REGULATION AND POLICY\n\nWe will also need clear policies on how AI will impact employment, consumer protection, and misinformation. Additionally, we will need to invest heavily in AI research, create job transition programmes, and partner with the private sector to ensure workers aren\u2019t left behind.\n\nBanning AI won\u2019t help. Trust me. I tried it at home until I found my daughter\u2019s ChatGPT prompt on how to hide AI influenced home work from daddy. Instead, Jamaican businesses need to integrate AI responsibly, ensuring that automation enhances productivity without completely erasing human workers. The trick is not to fight AI, but to work alongside it.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real. Not everyone can and will adapt. Some industries will shrink, and some workers will struggle to transition. But ignoring AI won\u2019t make it go away.\n\nDBS\u2019s announcement is just the first of many. More companies will follow, including Jamaican firms. The time to prepare is now, not when layoffs start happening.\n\nAnd if you still think AI is \u201cfar off\u201d from affecting you personally, remember that the next person to lose their job to AI might very well be the one reading this article right now.\n\nMajor Basil Jarrett is the director of communications at the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency (MOCA) and crisis communications consultant.

        "text": "As AI makes deeper inroads into organizations, employee concerns about the technology continue to grow. According to research from Gartner, those fears are primarily centered on job loss, as well as potential bias stemming from AI.\n\nExperts say most organizations aren\u2019t addressing those concerns well, which can undermine their growing investments in AI, impact employee morale, and spawn even more distrust of promising technology. SHRM Online spoke with Duncan Harris, a director with Gartner specializing in HR technology strategy, about how HR leaders can address the fear of AI among their own staff, as well as in the wider organization.\n\nAI and HR Jobs\n\nConventional wisdom says employees\u2019 biggest fear about AI is that it will take their jobs, but Harris said his research shows more workers believe their jobs will be redesigned, rather than replaced, by AI. Employees also worry that AI will make their jobs more complicated or less interesting.\n\nOrganizations should increase their investment in AI-related education to prepare workers for how their jobs may change, Harris said. HR can aid in that effort by collaborating with IT to provide learning and development on a range of topics, including how AI works, how to create effective prompts for generative AI (GenAI) tools, and how to evaluate AI outputs for biases and inaccuracies.\n\nAI adoption already has led to the redesign of many HR jobs, Harris noted. One example is in HR shared services, where HR staff who once spent much of their day answering employees\u2019 questions are now working alongside or overseeing chatbots that handle the bulk of those queries.\n\n\u201cUse of chatbots requires different levels of input from HR and administrators, including supporting initial setup of the bots, scripting, and being a subject matter expert on different HR processes,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt also includes monitoring, updating, and working alongside chatbots and virtual assistants where there are handover points.\u201d\n\nNew roles also are emerging and other HR job descriptions are changing to accommodate the arrival of AI, Harris said. One such role is product manager for internal talent marketplaces, which are platforms that use AI to match employees to internal opportunities such as short-term projects, full-time roles, mentoring, and job-shadowing arrangements. This role sits in the HR function and seeks to integrate the use of sophisticated technology solutions into other job roles in an organization.\n\nAnother example of how HR roles are adapting to new technologies is the growing use of employee experience teams that report to HR and IT, Harris said.\n\n\u201cThese fusion teams use process mapping and end-user persona creation, combined with talent expertise and ownership of technology governance, to coordinate increased adoption of emerging technologies, enhanced employee experience, and a link of those things to overall business goals,\u201d he said.\n\nGreater Transparency and Communication\n\nHarris said one key to alleviating all employees\u2019 concerns about AI is to better explain how the technology will be used. Few organizations are being fully transparent about how AI will impact their workforce and where and how they plan to use AI in their operations, he said.\n\nCompanies that show employees how AI works, provide input on where it can be helpful or harmful, and test solutions for accuracy can avoid fear of the unknown.\n\nHR, for example, shouldn\u2019t just provide general information about AI in its communications with employees. It needs to provide context and details on what risks and opportunities are influencing the organization\u2019s AI policies.\n\n\u201cFor example, one big concern is that GenAI can lead to organizations making inadvertent mistakes,\u201d Harris said, whether that\u2019s producing inaccurate outputs or leaking sensitive company data. \u201cFrom an executive perspective, the biggest concern for the future in using GenAI is around data privacy\u2014which is also one of the most common concerns for employees.\u201d\n\nHarris said some organizations adopt an employee digital bill of rights to help mitigate such concerns. The documents often include specific principles such as the right to purpose, or having a legitimate business purpose for any data collected; the right to limitation, or not collecting more data than is needed to fulfill a defined purpose; and the right to fairness, or using collected data in ways that reinforce equal opportunity, access, and treatment in the workplace.\n\nSome organizations also are using new governance structures to formalize accountability for AI ethics to minimize reputational risks of the technology, Harris said. One way they\u2019re doing that is by deputizing AI ethics representatives at the business unit level to oversee implementation of AI policies and practices in their departments.\n\nDave Zielinski is principal of Skiwood Communications, a business writing and editing company in Minneapolis.",

        "text": "Going into 2025, AI is becoming an ever-greater part of our lives. AI is finding its way into a variety of industries, serving B2B interests on the back end and B2C interests on the front end. Sectors ranging from healthcare and finance to manufacturing, retail and education are automating routine tasks, improving UX and enhancing decision-making processes with the technology.\n\nAI is also moving out of the data center and into the world through smartphones, IoT devices, autonomous cars and other intelligent instruments that interact with their environments. Improvements in real-time processing, lower latency, enhanced privacy and reduced bandwidth usage will make these embodied AI machines more efficient and safer.\n\nAt the same time, there remains a strong focus on the ethical use of AI, with an emphasis on fairness, transparency, explainability and accountability in AI models and decision-making processes. This is a departure from most technological advances, where ethics often play catch-up after adoption takes off.\n\nAll this AI growth means more jobs. Below is a discussion of the skills companies are looking for in an AI specialist, the industries that are aggressively adopting AI and a list of what might be the 10 hottest AI jobs and skills for 2025.\n\nTop AI job skills Many programmers across all fields are self-taught, and the resources available online make it easy for novices to educate themselves on popular languages, like C++, Java and Python. But the AI space has much higher demands. National University examined 15,000 job postings on Indeed to determine the requirements for AI jobs. It found 77% of AI job openings required that candidates have a master's degree, outpacing the 69% of postings that required at least a bachelor's degree. Another 18% required a doctoral degree, while only 8% of jobs posted were open to candidates with just a high school diploma. The job openings predominantly required a moderate amount of experience, with midlevel positions accounting for almost half the job openings (44%), followed by senior-level (26%) and entry-level (12%) roles. There were no jobs that called for no prior experience. And, while many types of IT jobs are remote work-friendly, AI jobs are not. Only 11% of job openings offered fully remote work, and another 15% allowed for a hybrid situation of on-premises work and remote work. The remaining 74% required on-site presence. In short, being a successful AI developer requires more than just coding skills. Proficiency in a core AI developer language, such as Python, Java or R, along with emerging languages, such as Julia or Scala, is essential. That alone won't land you a job, however. According to ZipRecruiter, programming is just one of the following five top required skills for AI programming jobs: Communication skills.\n\nKnowledge and experience with Python specifically.\n\nDigital marketing goals and strategies.\n\nEffective collaboration with others.\n\nAnalytical skills. AI jobs demand critical thinking skills on the part of developers to solve problems and analyze user input. The same practices apply to code. Having strong mathematical skills can help people develop advanced algorithms for programs. AI is also unique because it requires some knowledge of psychology because AI simulates human behavior. To create AI, people need to understand how humans think and how they might behave in different situations. Finally, with an emphasis on AI security, privacy and data integrity, individuals need to know the best practices behind security and ethics. Some industries are embracing AI faster than others. These include the following: Technology. Tech firms of all types are adding AI to their products to enhance their use and make them simpler and more user-friendly. Hyperscalers, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are all actively hiring AI specialists to build services.\n\nTech firms of all types are adding AI to their products to enhance their use and make them simpler and more user-friendly.

Electricians have a 91 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nPediatricians Median Annual Wage: $198,690 Projected Growth by 2033: 2.1 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: While artificial intelligence (AI) aids diagnostics, pediatric care requires empathy, a deep understanding of child psychology, and real-time adaptability to different developmental stages. Pediatricians also form long-term relationships with families, giving care and building trust, which AI cannot replicate. The nuanced nature of child health\u2014particularly in assessing nonverbal cues and handling family dynamics\u2014keeps this role grounded in human expertise. Pediatricians have an 87 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nConstruction Managers Median Annual Wage: $104,900 Projected Growth by 2033: 9.1 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: Construction managers must be flexible to adjust to on-site challenges, exercise human judgment, and possess leadership skills to guide a diverse team of architects, engineers, and contractors. AI tools can assist in planning, but the changing nature of construction demands immediate problem-solving and decision-making that cannot be automated. Construction managers have an 87 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nChild Social Workers Median Annual Wage: $53,940 Projected Growth by 2033: 4.9 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: Social work needs acute sensitivity, crisis intervention, and real-time versatility to address each child\u2019s circumstances. Building trust with vulnerable children and families involves emotional intelligence and ethical discernment, human qualities that AI software does not have. Additionally, child social workers advocate for clients in complicated social and legal systems, where personalized interaction and human insight are imperative. Child social workers have an 85 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nEnvironmental Engineers Median Annual Wage: $100,090 Projected Growth by 2033: 6.9 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: Environmental engineers work on many projects that need a strong understanding of environmental science, regulatory standards, and engineering principles. These professionals must assess site-specific conditions, conduct field tests, and engage with local communities. Human critical thinking and adaptability in complex, real-world situations are necessary for this role, which AI cannot match. Environmental engineers have an 84 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nPsychologists Median Annual Wage: $147,420 Projected Growth by 2033: 5.8 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: The work of a psychologist requires the capability to understand and interpret human emotions and behaviors in highly individualized ways. Therapy involves forming trust, emotional support, and a nuanced understanding that AI systems cannot copy. Advanced AI tools can aid in detecting patterns, but the therapeutic relationship and empathy necessary to respond to patients\u2019 emotional needs make this one of the jobs that AI can\u2019t replace. Psychologists must also adapt their approaches to different cultural, social, and personal backgrounds\u2014skills that AI lacks. Psychologists have an 84 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nRegistered Nurses Median Annual Wage: $86,070 Projected Growth by 2033: 6 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: This role requires hands-on clinical skills, real-time decision-making, and compassionate patient interaction. Nurses respond to changes in patient conditions and make quick assessments, often in high-stress situations. AI can aid in automated documentation and monitoring but cannot replicate clinical judgment and human presence in patient care. Registered nurses have an 83 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nChefs Median Annual Wage: $58,920 Projected Growth by 2033: 8.3 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: Cooking involves creativity, sensory judgment, and adjusting to customer preferences, which AI cannot recreate. A chef\u2019s capacity to innovate new dishes and modify recipes based on ingredients makes this role irreplaceable by AI tools. Some AI-powered robots can help in food preparation tasks, such as chopping or mixing, but a deep understanding of textures and flavors is important. In addition, the human touch in creating a memorable dining experience goes beyond what AI can offer. Chefs have a 77 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nHuman Resources Managers Median Annual Wage: $136,350 Projected Growth by 2033: 6.5 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: HR management necessitates high emotional intelligence, negotiation skills, and personalized decision-making that AI cannot reproduce. AI software can handle administrative tasks, like resume screening or interview scheduling. However, human intervention is needed for making complex decisions regarding employee development, conflict resolution, and performance assessments, as these tasks require context-based empathetic judgment. HR managers have a 73 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nLawyers Median Annual Wage: $145,760 Projected Growth by 2033: 5.2 percent Why It\u2019s AI-Proof: Even though AI tools can help in legal research and documentation, legal work requires critical thinking, client interaction, and emotional intelligence, especially in high-stakes legal cases. Lawyers evaluate complex situations, interpret laws with distinctive contexts, and make judgments based on client needs. The human ability to craft persuasive arguments and provide tailored advice in emotionally charged situations ensures this role\u2019s resilience against AI. Lawyers have a 71 percent AI-proof job rating.\n\nHow to Build AI-Proof Careers\n\nAs generative AI continues to shape the future of the workforce, understanding how to make your career AI-proof has never been more important. While AI may replace certain jobs or tasks, you can safeguard your professional value as more employers adopt AI.\n\nAdapt to Changing Roles and Industries\n\nAI will continue to affect traditional job functions, so adaptability is a must-have quality. This may mean shifting to new roles or being open to new careers in the AI field. Diversify your skill set and view change as an opportunity. By welcoming career pivots and evolving with the industry, you can ensure your career stays relevant through technological disruption.\n\nCommit to AI Learning and Skill Development\n\nAI is changing fast, and to keep up, it\u2019s important to keep learning. Adopting a lifelong learning mindset allows you to stay flexible when dealing with new technologies and AI trends. This lowers the possibility of AI replacing you. Consider diving into online AI courses or industry workshops to enhance your skills. Investing in AI certifications and exploring related fields like AI ethics could open new doors for your career.\n\nUse AI Tools to Boost Your Productivity\n\nInstead of treating AI as a threat, use it as a tool. AI-powered tools can automate repetitive tasks, freeing you up for more creative endeavors and increasing productivity. Integrating AI into your work will also hone your practical skills and demonstrate your ability to use the technology to your advantage. Combine your expertise with the power of AI to further elevate your professional value.\n\nDevelop Human-Centric Skills\n\nAI systems are great at crunching numbers and processing data, but they can\u2019t replace emotional intelligence, leadership, empathy, and critical thinking, which gives humans a competitive edge. Develop and apply these soft skills in your daily work to AI-proof your career. These abilities are especially valuable in roles that need human judgment.\n\nCultivate Creativity\n\nUnlike AI, humans can think outside the box, innovate, and produce entirely new things. Roles in design and content creation warrant originality and are less likely to be automated. Strengthen your creative skills and approach problems from a novel perspective to become indispensable in these industries. Artistic flair is one of the most significant areas where AI falls short since the technology ultimately relies on learned patterns.\n\nExpand Your Professional Network\n\nConnect with peers to stay informed about the latest AI developments that might affect your role. Networking provides opportunities to collaborate, share skills, and learn advanced techniques from fellow experts for effectively using AI. A strong network raises your credibility, as AI can\u2019t recreate human trust. Participate in industry events, join relevant groups, and make professional connections to stay engaged.\n\nShould You Shift Careers to an AI-Proof Job?\n\nIf you\u2019re worried that your job might be at risk of automation, shifting to an AI-proof job could provide stability\u2014at least for now. These roles typically involve skills AI struggles to copy, such as inventiveness and genuine human connection. AI-proof jobs rely heavily on emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills, making them less vulnerable to being taken over by machines.\n\nKeep in mind that AI is advancing at an astonishing pace. Even jobs that seem secure today might not be immune to future changes. While creative roles are currently less affected by AI, tools like AI image generators that assist with content creation are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and traditionally safe roles may not remain that way.\n\nThe best approach is to stay adaptable. Continuously upskill, remain flexible, and be ready for change. This will position you for long-term career resilience, so you\u2019re prepared for whatever changes come your way. And don\u2019t just focus on finding an AI-proof job\u2014seek roles that truly interest you and align with your strengths.\n\nThe Future of AI in the Workforce\n\nIn the future, AI\u2019s growing presence in the workforce will steadily transform work processes by taking over routine tasks and performing them with consistent precision and speed. While concerns about job displacement are prevalent, there\u2019s a high chance that AI will not only revamp existing job roles but also offer new opportunities. Here\u2019s a look at what the future holds and how AI is expected the influence the way we work:\n\nShift in Skills Demand: AI-driven companies prioritize proficiency in AI and big data, which have emerged as necessary competencies for future employees. Organizations are not just looking for professionals with AI knowledge; they are investing in training their employees in AI-related skills to equip them for future challenges and be more productive.\n\nAI-driven companies prioritize proficiency in AI and big data, which have emerged as necessary competencies for future employees.

For example, managerial tasks are likely to be enhanced by AI rather than replaced\u2014rather than fully replacing most jobs with automated tools, AI will augment human capabilities instead. Potential New Job Categories: The rise of AI will create new job categories for managing, overseeing, and linking AI systems. Fresh roles may include AI ethics specialists and AI trainers, which will center on tasks requiring technical knowledge and human oversight. Jobs related to supervising AI-driven decision-making, ensuring responsible AI use, and developing new applications for specific industry requirements may also open.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhich IT Jobs Will Be Safe From AI? IT jobs requiring deep technical knowledge and problem-solving skills are less likely to be replaced by AI. This includes cybersecurity specialists, data scientists, and AI engineers, roles that seek expertise that AI can\u2019t reproduce. Jobs in ensuring ethical AI use and guiding AI integration will also continue to be relevant. What Jobs Will AI Affect the Most? AI will have the greatest impact on repetitive tasks, routine analysis, or large-scale data processing jobs. Roles like customer service representatives, bookkeepers, and receptionists are particularly vulnerable, as these jobs are more likely to be automated.\n\nBottom Line: Embrace AI-Proof Jobs for Long-Term Career Success\n\nAI is here to stay and will inevitably continue to revolutionize our work. Although this technology can take over many tasks and replace many jobs, it can\u2019t duplicate the human touch or innovative thinking. To secure lasting career success, concentrate on building mastery in areas where human abilities surpass machine capabilities. Continuously adapt to industry changes, expand your skillset, and use AI to improve your work to remain indispensable and ensure your career blooms alongside technology.\n\nExploring AI job opportunities?

        "text": "Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, thinks that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will replace humans, and that will be a good thing.\n\nIn an interview with 'Fox Business', Gates said that robots taking over our jobs will make us more efficient and give us more free time.\n\n\"Well, of course we can look forward to the idea that the holidays will be longer at some point. If we can be twice as productive as today with less work, the purpose of humanity is not simply to sit behind a counter and sell things\", he said to 'Fox Business', Telegraph reports.\n\nGates is arguing that AI, the technology that some fear is already eliminating jobs from low-wage workers, is allowing us to better manage our time. In a way, that's right. If AI allows us to get into our cars and answer e-mails, it would save time.\n\nBut companies like Amazon are starting to develop technology that could eventually eliminate cashier jobs. The new form of cashierless stores uses AI to find out what customers put in their baskets and charges them as soon as they leave the store, without the need for a checkout. Amazon has not announced plans to bring the technology to Whole Foods, the retail chain it recently bought for $13.7 billion, and the new store has hired people to help customers and put products on the shelves.\n\n\"There will be challenges because the rate of change is going to be faster in these next 20 years than it has been before,\" Gates said.\n\nHe admits that the government will likely be forced to review its social security programs and help out-of-work workers retrain for the new economy, but if done right, it will be a pretty positive thing for everyone.\n\nIf society is able to own all the food, housing, and consumer goods it needs, workers should be allowed to relax and focus on other interests, Gates argues.\n\nThat future is likely far off, but AI can already see and hear more accurately than humans. Some of the smartest people in technology have different views on how society should handle technology with this rapid growth, but all agree that it will significantly change the world. Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, recently said that AI is more important to humanity than mastering fire or electricity.\n\nGates says that all this change will give society more decisions and opportunities in the future \"because you will be much more productive\". /Telegraph/",

        "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword\u2014it\u2019s a disruptive force reshaping industries across the globe. From Indian IT giants to global conglomerates, companies are racing to harness AI\u2019s potential. The excitement around its possibilities is palpable, yet there are concerns. The looming question is this: Will AI lead to massive job losses or is there more to the story?\n\nWhile industry experts offer differing perspectives, this much is undeniable: there is job displacement, but there is also job creation. The need to upskill has never been more critical, as AI is not just eliminating jobs, it\u2019s transforming them.\n\n\u201cAI is set to fundamentally reshape workforce strategies over the next decade, especially in industries like IT, where change is the only constant,\u201d says Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, Director\u2013AI Research, Zoho Corp.\n\nRamamoorthy anticipates that AI will enhance roles focused on data processing, routine decision-making, and operational tasks. Jobs like support agents, quality assurance testers, and data analysts may undergo major transformations as AI takes over repetitive work. However, this shift isn\u2019t about job losses\u2014it\u2019s about job evolution.\n\nOn the other hand, Avinash Godkhindi, MD & CEO, Zaggle, a listed SaaS firm, says that roles that involve repetitive, rule-based tasks, such as data entry, financial reconciliation, and basic customer support, are likely to be rationalised. AI can automate these tasks with greater accuracy and speed.\n\nTalking to Business Today, Ritesh Malhotra, Enterprise Head Great Learning , a leading global edtech company, says preparing the workforce for roles that don\u2019t yet exist requires foresight, adaptability, and a commitment to continuous learning.\n\n\u201cWe focus on building foundational skills in AI, data science, and digital literacy, as these technical competencies form the backbone for innovation and enable employees to adapt quickly to new technologies,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSimilar to the rise of electricity and telephony, believe AI will be a force multiplier in creating new jobs and spurring economic growth,\u201d Ramamoorthy says.\n\nA World Economic Forum report backs this optimistic outlook. By 2025, AI is expected to displace 75 million jobs globally, while creating 133 million new ones. While certain industries will experience significant displacement, the overall impact will be a net gain of 58 million jobs worldwide.\n\nAs AI takes centre stage, industry experts say the roles AI can\u2019t easily replace are those that require critical thinking, creativity, and interpersonal skills\u2014fields like business development, product management, and client relationship management. These roles, however, will evolve, gaining importance as they leverage AI tools to make better decisions and deliver value.",

In fact, the pulse survey indicates that organisations with company-wide implementations of GenAI are in fact more likely to be increasing tech headcount in the next year than the average.\u201d\n\nThe research also found that, as GenAI is being rapidly rolled out more widely, appointments of a chief AI officer (CAIO) is increasing with one in 20 UK organisations already having a person in the role and a similar proportion planning to appoint one.\n\nBut for the majority of organisations, AI strategy still sits with the tech leader, the chief information or technology officers.\n\nThe survey also found that to support employees and ensure the safe use of GenAI in their organisations, UK tech leaders have rapidly rolled out GenAI policies, with the number with a policy in place doubling in just six months.\n\nFor many, this has been a \u201cretrofit\u201d policy after GenAI has been adopted, but almost four in 10 tech leaders remain concerned about the misuse of GenAI tools.\n\nTech leaders in the UK see the potential of AI, but 55% have yet to find a clear business case beyond a personal productivity tool, and 27% are struggling with budgetary constraints.\n\nWhite added: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there have been some incredible advances. One tech leader mentioned how the last year has seen a giant leap in cancer screening through AI \u2013 good news for us all. Another talks about how machine learning has supported the fundraising revenue for their higher education institution, opening access to a wider student population.\u201d\n\nThe research found that 43% expect to increase their tech budget, and 36% plan to increase their tech headcount.\n\nNineteen per cent of respondents say they have increased the number of days employees are expected in the office. For those organisations where employees are mandated to be in the office, the typical time expected has moved from 2-3 days to 3 days. Most leaders are happy with the results: 42% say it is working \u2018extremely well\u2019 (up 20% in six months), while 45% say \u2018quite well\u2019, although some say more days in the office does have consequences, especially on diverse hiring.\n\nThe survey was carried out in May 2024 among 322 tech leaders globally including 182 in the UK.\n\nSign up to our weekly round-up of HR news and guidance Receive the Personnel Today Direct e-newsletter every Wednesday Email (Required) OptOut From time to time, we will send you emails about selected products, events and services from Personnel Today and OHW+ - but you can choose to opt-out at any time.

        "text": "Workers can stop worrying about being replaced by generative artificial intelligence.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Wharton School experts Valery Yakubovich, Peter Cappelli and Prasanna Tambe believe it isn\u2019t going to happen as drastically as many predict. In an essay published in The Wall Street Journal, the professors contend that AI will most likely create more jobs for people because it needs intensive human oversight to produce useable results.\n\n\u201cThe big claims about AI assume that if something is possible in theory, then it will happen in practice. That is a big leap,\u201d they wrote. \u201cModern work is complex, and most jobs involve much more than the kind of things AI is good at \u2014 mainly summarizing text and generating output based on prompts.\u201d\n\nYakubovich recently spoke to Wharton Business Daily, offering several key facts he hopes will allay people\u2019s fears of robotic replacement. First, while generative AI has advanced rapidly, it still has a long way to go before it can function autonomously and predictably.\n\nSecond, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are capable of processing vast amounts of data, but they cannot parse it accurately and are prone to misleading information, known as AI hallucinations. \u201cYou get this output summary \u2014 how accurate is it? Who is going to adjudicate among alternative outputs on the same topic? Remember, it\u2019s a black box,\u201d said Yakubovich.\n\nThird, companies are risk-averse and need to maintain a high degree of efficiency and control to be successful. So, they won\u2019t be rushing to lay off all their people in exchange for technology that still has a lot of bugs to work out. \u201cIf we are thinking 40, 50 years ahead, that\u2019s wide-open ended,\u201d Yakubovich said. \u201cThe issue we are discussing now is very the specific [needs] for business. The risk for companies is very high, and they are not going to move very fast.\u201d\n\nLLMs are not even replacing humans in communication tasks\n\nDespite its shortcomings, generative AI has been touted for its ability to handle what many consider to be mundane communication at work \u2014 interacting with customers online, producing reports and writing marketing copy such as press releases. But the professors point out that many of those tasks have already been taken from workers. For example, chatbots handle customer complaints, and client-facing employees are often given scripted language vetted by lawyers.\n\nYakubovich said most office interaction is informal communication, and a lot of useful organizational knowledge is tacit. While digital tools are increasingly capable of capturing both, nobody wants their emails, Slack chats or Zoom transcripts freely parsed by an LLM, and the quality of extracted information is hard to verify.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any company yet that dared to feed their emails into the models, because you can learn a lot about the company from that. Who wants to give open access?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to control what the model will produce and for whom. That\u2019s why the models are very hard to use within the organization.\u201d\n\nCompanies also don\u2019t want AI involved in politically sensitive matters, especially if there are legal concerns. \u201cWhat I see so far in talking to senior leaders of companies is that they try to avoid completely using models in politically charged cases because they know they will have more work to do adjudicating among the different parties,\u201d he said.\n\nData science has been around for years, Yakubovich said, yet many companies still lack good infrastructure to organize the tremendous information that the technology is capable of collecting. Even if they built it, humans are still an indispensable part of making sense of it all.\n\n\u201cIf you want to curate everything, it\u2019s a lot of work, and this is where more jobs will emerge,\u201d he said.\n\n[Knowledge at Wharton first published this piece.]\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer\u2019s editorial policy.",

        "text": "A global survey conducted by Verdantix has indicated that more than half of businesses expect 10% of job roles to be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI) agents in the next five years.\n\nThe research, which involved 252 senior executives from IT and AI functions, revealed that 62% of these businesses foresee significant cost savings mainly from the elimination of management roles rather than frontline worker roles. These companies anticipate that budget allocations for AI projects will increase by 10-24% within a year.\n\nIndustries such as sales, marketing, and customer service are likely to experience a higher number of AI-related projects, with 28% of respondents indicating such developments this year. This suggests a growing comfort in these fields towards integrating AI, though it may also imply potential risks for jobs in these areas.\n\nDespite predictions of job displacement, many firms are currently employing AI in collaboration with human workers rather than in a standalone capacity. 72% of businesses have integrated AI into processes like chat, research, and creative writing. In contrast, only 37% have deployed domain-specific autonomous AI agents. The idea of human/AI co-pilots is also gaining traction, particularly within the transport sector, where 67% of firms expect its adoption by 2025.\n\nHowever, while companies are increasing investments in AI, there is caution regarding the full autonomy of the technology, with only 11% of executives believing that computers will achieve human-like intelligence by 2030.\n\nCommenting on the findings, David Metcalfe, CEO of Verdantix, stated, \"The findings show an upward trend in expected AI investment and integration in the coming years. How this plays out in the short and medium term though is very different. The immediate sees predominantly human machine cooperation, with AI augmenting or replacing parts of jobs. However, by 2030, though there is wide acknowledgement that computers won't have the same intelligence level as humans, we are going to see full job role replacement in segments of the market as integration and AI autonomy beds in.\"\n\nMetcalfe also highlighted the broader implications for job creation and workforce adjustments: \"This isn't just a challenge for the existing workforce to face. It will naturally also affect future job creation. For example, using AI automation to increase the volume of audits without hiring more auditors. And it's not just replacements and cuts \u2013 it's shifts too. The complexity of AI technologies was cited as the most significant factor slowing AI adoption, suggesting a change in skills is also required.\"\n\nAccording to the survey, a majority of firms (52%) describe their AI strategy as one aimed at securing competitive advantage. Faster process execution is expected to be a significant benefit arising from AI projects in the next three years, as indicated by 30% of the respondents.\n\nMetcalfe concluded, \"AI is becoming a genuine corporate differentiator if harnessed correctly. Though the reality of making this a success requires a pragmatic and informed approach to short, medium and long-term workforce adjustments. It is a complex, but crucial step change to be addressed.\"",

Similarly, postal service clerks, bank tellers, and data entry clerks are also at risk of drastic reductions, as digital systems take over these traditionally human-driven tasks.\n\nHowever, the report highlights a bright spot for frontline workers.\n\nRoles in industries such as delivery, construction, farming, and food processing are expected to grow significantly in the coming years. These jobs require human oversight, problem-solving, and hands-on work that is difficult for AI and machines to fully replicate.\n\nThe care sector is another area expected to remain largely unaffected. Jobs like nurses, counsellors, teachers, and social workers all rely heavily on empathy, interpersonal skills, and human judgment \u2013 traits that AI is still far from replicating.\n\nIt comes after a growing trend continues to take over social media, in which people are turning to AI bots for free therapy.\n\nDoctors offered their candid thoughts on the matter, expressing that while AI tools may seem like a quick fix, nothing beats the support and guidance of a real person who truly understands your needs.\n\nHow to join the indy100's free WhatsApp channel\n\nSign up for our free Indy100 weekly newsletter\n\nHave your say in our news democracy.

Meanwhile, 44% report that there will be layoffs in 2024 resulting from AI efficiency.\n\nBut even amid reports of AI-inspired layoffs, many experts disagree with Musk's view.\n\nJulia Toothacre, resume and career strategist at ResumeBuilder, recognizes the numbers from its research may not accurately reflect the broad business landscape. \"There are still so many traditional organizations and small businesses that do not embrace technology the way that some of the larger companies do,\" Toothacre said.\n\nLayoffs are a reality, but AI technology is also enabling business leaders to restructure and redefine the jobs we do.\n\nAlex Hood, chief product officer at project management and collaboration software company Asana, estimates that half the time we spend at work is on what he calls \"work about work.\" Here, he's referring to the status updates, cross-departmental communication and all the other parts of work that aren't at the core of why we're there.\n\n\"If that can be reduced because of AI, that can be a great unlock,\" said Hood.\n\nHe says that without the nuance behind the numbers, the statistics marking and predicting AI-induced layoffs reflect fear more than reality.\n\nWith AI tackling task-based work, humans have the opportunity to move up the value chain, says Marc Cenedella, founder of Leet Resumes and Ladders. \"For the entire economy,\" Cenedella said workers will be able to focus on \"integrating or structuring or defining what the task-based work is.\" He compares this shift to mid-century office culture, when there were entire floors of typists \u2014 something that the efficiency of word processors eliminated.\n\nWhite-collar work and 'human-centered' AI\n\nAccording to Asana's State of AI at Work 2023 report, employees say that 29% of their work tasks are replaceable by AI. However, Asana is a proponent of what it calls \"human-centered AI,\" which seeks to enhance human abilities and collaboration, not replace people outright. The more people understand human-centered AI, the more they believe it will have a positive impact on their work, the report states.\n\nWhite-collar and clerical workers represent somewhere between 19.6%\u201330.4% of all employed people globally, according to the United Nations. Analytical and communication tools have redirected knowledge work over the years, and \"generative AI should be considered another development in this long continuum of change.\"\n\nBut as of 2022, 34% of the global population still did not have access to the internet, so any conversation around AI's impact on layoffs and potential restructuring of the work needs to also include discussion of a wider mote between the technological haves and have-nots.\n\nA worker's personal responsibility and AI tinkering\n\nFor professionals seeking to avoid redundancy in an AI-fueled work environment, there are steps to take.\n\nCenedella says that being a modern white-collar professional bears a level of personal responsibility. \"Part of your job is to keep developing new skills,\" he said. \"If you learned some software five years ago, that's not enough. You've got to learn new software today.\"\n\nWhile positions like research and data analysis are in line for AI automation, for example, companies will still need someone to prompt the AI, make sense of the results and take action.\n\n\"My advice for anyone is to understand how AI could impact your position in your industry right now,\" Toothacre said. \"At least you have an idea of what to potentially expect versus having no idea what's going on.\"\n\nBut Cenedella also recognizes that there's an expectation for business leaders to help employees continue developing their skills during their time at the company. \"Just out of their own self-interest, the companies that do fund the development of their employees are going to be better positioned to be a little bit more ahead of the companies that don't,\" he said.\n\nEven Hood, who's on the front lines of creating collaboration and project management solutions using AI, still experiments with his own products. In preparation for an upcoming performance review for a member of his team, Hood experimented by asking AI to summarize how he was collaborating with the team member.\n\nThe AI produced a list of all of their shared interests, all of the assignments and feedback between them, and a characterization of their relationship based on messages they've sent to each other. In this, Hood exemplifies what AI tinkering can look like.\n\n\"You learn it by asking it questions and seeing what it's capable of, and in some ways being disappointed, and in some ways being wowed, and then leaning into that,\" Hood said. \"The best thing that employers can do is give folks the ability to understand what the art of the possible is through individual experimentation using AI today.\"\n\nWhile layoffs are happening as a result of the current generation of AI, there's no historical evidence that technological advancements such as this will result in mass unemployment. The workforce has a history of malleability, and increased technological capacity can result in \"higher value\" work, as Cenedella says \u2014 and more productivity that future generations of AI will likely learn to handle.",

        "text": "Much of the concern about artificial intelligence displacing jobs has so far come from people who are at the junior end of the workforce. Some of this stems from the belief that AI benefits workers with greater task-based responsibilities versus the broader job responsibilities of higher-level workers (with many experts saying AI is nearly at the level of a good intern). Some stems from this population having more time left in the workforce \u2014 and from that perspective, more to lose as technology develops over time.\n\nStill, 30% of senior-level employees fear they'll be fired for lacking AI skills, according to a recent report from online tutoring company Preply. But is this worry realistic?\n\n\"To the extent people are eligible for retirement, if there is a big skills gap, you may find people who choose to retire or just find completely different work,\" said Steve Preston, president and CEO at Goodwill Industries International, a leading nonprofit provider of educational and workforce-related services. But not everyone in senior positions falls in that camp, he says \u2014 nor do the companies that employ these people want them to quit.\n\n\"One of the most devastating forms of employee attrition is when you lose institutional knowledge and customer knowledge,\" Preston said. \"You absolutely want to retain those people, and you want to help them be more productive.\"\n\nExperienced employees can master AI insights\n\nDespite the general stereotype that older workers (who often make up the senior-level echelon) have a harder time adapting to new technology, Preston recognizes that these are the workers for whom AI has unique advantages. \"If a job requires engagement with AI, I actually think some older workers are going to be better able to leverage it to get insights,\" he said, \"both in terms of querying AI more effectively and in terms of getting the results of AI-supported work and being able to apply judgment to it.\"\n\nIn other words, someone with a more complex understanding of the business is more effective at applying inputs and assessing outputs using knowledge and skills that AI has not mastered (at least not yet).\n\nJeetu Patel, executive vice president and general manager of security and collaboration at Cisco, says AI is not yet replacing whole, complex jobs, but rather tasks. \"Over time, will it get good at doing jobs? Absolutely,\" he said. \"But no one really knows what the timeframe for that will be.\"\n\nFor the senior-level workforce, Patel says the next few years will be more about augmentation versus any sort of displacement or replacement \u2014 given, of course, these workers are willing to meet their employers in the middle and enhance their hard and soft skills in the context of an AI-driven workplace.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, 57% of industry experts predict a surge in the demand for soft skills, according to a report from learning management system platform TalentLMS.\n\n\"Ultimately, every company is a collection of employees, which are all humans, and they need to be touched and motivated in a very human way,\" said Nikhil Arora, CEO of Epignosis (parent company of TalentLMS). This is something senior management will have to bear in mind under a modern context as day-to-day roles across the employment architecture change.\n\nReverse mentoring need is high\n\nAnother strategy for higher-level workers to take into consideration, Arora says, is reverse mentoring, a process in which senior management seeks the perspective of less experienced employees. \"A lot of young people who are basically growing up on AI, for them it's second nature, where a lot of senior leaders perhaps are now learning AI. It's almost upside down,\" Arora said. He's a big believer in always having two sets of mentors, \"one who's perhaps more seasoned than you, and one who's much younger, because they are closer to the disruptive technologies and how the new age customers are going to behave.\"\n\nWith younger workers as near-native AI users, creating seniority-agnostic mentorship could enable the organization to innovate at a much faster velocity than a top-down strategy. At this point, nearly half (47%) of employees say they still don't use AI skills in their jobs, according to the 2024 State of Upskilling and Reskilling Report from TalentLMS and Workable. Meanwhile, half agree that their work would benefit from it. Some organizations are embarking on structured training journeys for members of their workforce and clientele (Goodwill, for example, received a portion of Google's $75 million AI Opportunity Fund as a grant to spread AI training across the communities they serve).\n\nGenerative AI and automated hours\n\nThe reality is that nearly a third of hours worked in the U.S. could be automated by generative AI, potentially altering the way many business professionals \u2014 executives and senior managers included \u2014 do their work. Leaders at companies like IBM and Duolingo have been vocal about replacing some humans with AI.\n\nIn the race to AI, offloading the wrong people could have unintended consequences, like losing institutional knowledge that can operate in complex, interpersonal environments.\n\n\"It would be easy to write off older workers and say this is just going to be too hard for them, they're not going to adapt,\" Preston said. \"Let's lean into the value of AI to help leverage the jobs of the future for older workers, rather than assuming that for some reason, it's going to leave them behind.\"",

        "text": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman advises students to learn AI to stay relevant in the job market.\n\nAltman's advice contrasts with Vinod Khosla's warning that AI could replace many jobs.\n\nAn Indeed study found that 2,800 work skills are \"very unlikely\" to be replaced by generative AI.\n\nThere's been a lot of buzz about artificial intelligence snatching jobs from us poor humans.\n\nAnd if our robot overlords in waiting have been listening, they've heard many a tech leader and thinker repeat the idea that AI won't take your job, but someone who knows how to use it will.\n\nThat notion got thrust back into the spotlight recently when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that students worried that AI will sideline them should double down on learning to use the technology \u2014 an approach that he said worked for him with computer programming.\n\n\"I'm confident that there will be lots of jobs and also that many of them will look somewhat different than the jobs of today, but we never seem to run out of stuff to do,\" Altman said in a taped interview with Indeed CEO Chris Hyams released Thursday.\n\nAltman's sunny take was at odds with one offered days earlier by Silicon Valley investor Vinod Khosla, who warned that AI would one day be able to take on 80% of the work of 80% of jobs. He also said that, unlike with earlier tech waves, workers might not be able to simply build their skills to inoculate themselves against job losses.\n\nYet despite all the worrying about how AI might pillory the job market, people from execs to students appear to be pushing ahead with what Altman would recommend: going deep on the tech.\n\nAltman noted that computer programming was already popular when he was in school but \"nothing like\" today. \"People would say the same things \u2014 many of the same things \u2014 they say about AI now,\" he said.\n\nHumans have a lot of skills\n\nAnother point for the don't-worry camp came from a new Indeed study identifying more than 2,800 work skills. The job site's researchers, using lengthy prompts with a generative AI tool, determined that none of those skills were \"very likely\" to be replaced by GenAI.\n\nSvenja Gudell, Indeed's chief economist, told BI that so-called upskilling can offer big benefits but isn't \"magic.\" She said some people could still lose their jobs due to technological advancements.\n\n\"They'll have to figure out how to use these tools. It won't be easy,\" Gudell said.\n\nBut \"at least with the technology that we're seeing today, it's not the kind of AI automation where you have smart robots working in warehouses,\" she said.\n\nKhosla, who cofounded Sun Microsystems and who has invested in OpenAI, had warned that bipedal robots were one of the developments that would imperil humans' abilities to hang onto their jobs.\n\nBefore the robots show up to stock store shelves, they'd be more likely to come for desk jobs.\n\nFor now, Indeed's Gudell said, there's been a pickup in demand and pay for people well-versed in aspects of AI.\n\n\"If you're a prompt engineer \u2014 if you're a machine learning engineer that can actually program some of this stuff \u2014 you're getting a very healthy wage increase,\" Gudell said.\n\nOne of the professions that would appear most at risk of an AI takeover is coding. Yet, as BI previously reported, some experienced software engineers contend that AI will help them get more done without taking over their jobs because their work extends well beyond coding.\n\nKids are still learning to code\n\nIt seems worries about an AI job-pocalypse aren't deterring some people from going big on tech, as Altman advises.\n\nEdward Kim is vice president of education and training at Code Ninjas. The company teaches software engineering to kids ages five to 14 through in-person classes in the US, Canada, and the UK.\n\nHe told BI the company is seeing strong demand from people hoping to open franchise locations. Within two years, the company plans to add 200 locations on top of the more than 350 it has now.\n\nThe professional coders Kim talks to already use AI to do things like generating starter code. But these engineers aren't that worried about getting pushed out of their jobs, he said, because coders are working for people who need them to do more than just write line after line in various programming languages.\n\nEmployers need \"someone with a real-world context to put the right adaptation to it, to make it applicable to something in the real world, so it can be useful,\" Kim said (aka: be a human).\n\nA couple of years ago, Code Ninjas' students might take around 18 months to become proficient in a new language. Now, he said, it's closer to six to 12 months for those same languages.\n\n\"It shows that the kids that are coming up have an increasing thirst for this type of knowledge,\" Kim said.\n\nIt's a desire to learn that Altman indicated he showed back when he was a student. He said computer programming had been a net positive.\n\n\"It has made some classes of jobs go away,\" Altman said. Still, \"it's made way more new things happen and also given us the ability to do a lot of new things.\"",

        "text": "Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of the popular \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service Klarna, has stirred debate with a bold claim: artificial intelligence (AI) can now perform nearly all tasks traditionally done by human employees. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, he explained how AI\u2019s rapid progress is changing how businesses operate, raising questions about the future of jobs in a world where automation takes the lead.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nKlarna has adopted a unique approach to reducing its workforce without layoffs. The company stopped hiring new employees a year ago, resulting in a gradual shrinkage of its team. Employee numbers have dropped from 4,500 to 3,500, largely due to an annual attrition rate of 20 per cent, a trend common in tech firms. Siemiatkowski explained that instead of replacing departing employees, Klarna is using AI and automation to fill the gaps.\n\n\u201cWe have a natural attrition like every tech company. People stay for about five years, so 20 per cent leave every year. By not hiring, we are simply shrinking,\u201d he said.\n\nHigher pay for remaining employees\n\nWhile Klarna\u2019s workforce gets smaller, the company isn\u2019t cutting corners on salaries. Siemiatkowski suggested that savings from reduced staffing could allow for higher pay for those still on the payroll. Although Klarna\u2019s website still lists a few job openings, these are limited to essential roles, particularly in engineering, reflecting a shift in hiring priorities across the tech industry.\n\nKlarna isn\u2019t alone in betting big on automation. IBM\u2019s CEO, Arvind Krishna, recently said that AI could replace certain jobs within five years, especially in departments like Human Resources. This trend signals a broader shift, with companies across industries exploring how AI can streamline operations and reshape their workforces.\n\nMany tech companies including giants like Google, Amazon, Meta and others have also reduced their workforce significantly in the past years. Most of the big tech companies did not specifically mention AI as the reason behind the shrinkage but the general trend shows how AI is increasing productivity of remaining employees without an increase in headcount.",

        "text": "Listen to this article Listen to this article\n\nThe discussion about artificial intelligence is often fraught with dystopian overtones, as if life as we know it is in peril. Of particular concern is the fate of many jobs as AI continues its relentless push into the workplace. As noted in a recent report by Tech.co, \u201cThe Companies That Have Already Replaced Workers with AI in 2024,\u201d \u201cFor those wondering when artificial intelligence will start replacing human workers, the answer is that it already has.\u201d\n\nThe article shows how this trend is well along, listing such organizations as MSN, Google, and IKEA as pioneers in using AI extensively to replace employees. It cites a survey by The Conference Board which found that \u201c[h]alf of CEOs and 51% of C-Suite executives believe AI will displace labor in their organizations.\u201d\n\nHowever, history shows that any new, disruptive technology creates as many, or more, jobs than it eliminates. A recent Forbes article, \u201cHow Does Artificial Intelligence Create New Jobs?,\u201d is illuminating and on the mark. The author, Marco Iacoviello, points to positive implications of the AI revolution. Some examples:\n\nBy automating repetitive chores that require little thought\u2014for example, those seemingly endless emails\u2014AI can free up workers to focus on more meaningful tasks that require creativity.\n\nThe very introduction of AI systems will create new job opportunities for \u201cmachine learning engineers, data scientists and specialized researchers.\u201d\n\nAI is also redefining entire fields. \u201cFor example, in the healthcare sector, AI can enhance medical diagnosis, expedite drug discovery and support telemedicine. This paves the way for professional profiles like \u2018health data analysts,\u2019 who interpret and analyze data collected by AI systems to provide more precise and personalized diagnoses.\u201d\n\nThe ethical consequences of AI in organizations calls for ethics experts \u201cto ensure that decisions made by AI systems align with moral and social principles.\u201d\n\nWhat sets AI\u2019s impact apart from that of previous disruptive technologies is the pace of change. The AI revolution began just two years ago with the introduction of ChatGPT in November of 2022. With breakneck speed, AI is already transforming the world of work.\n\nAccording to Harvard Business Review\u2019s September/October 2023 issue in the article \u201cReskilling in the Age of AI , \u201d The average half-life of skills is now less than five years, and in some tech fields it\u2019s as low as two and a half years. While not all knowledge workers will lose their jobs, many of them will find that AI and other new technologies have so significantly altered their roles that in effect they\u2019re working in completely new fields.\n\nAre college graduates prepared for this revolution? The evidence suggests there is work to do. An Inside Higher Ed article, \u201cMajority of Grads Wish They\u2019d Been Taught AI in College,\u201d cites a survey by Cengage Group of 974 recent graduates. They found that 70 percent believe basic generative AI training should be part of their curriculum, while 55 percent said their degree programs did not adequately prepare them to use the new technology tools in the workforce. Given how recent these changes are, it\u2019s not surprising that university curricula will take some time to adapt. But adapting is critical.\n\nAt RIT, we established an AI Hub to address the practical and ethical challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including a comprehensive approach to teaching and learning, as well as facilitating curricular changes and research across disciplines. The AI Hub will also engage our students, ensuring their active involvement and addressing their needs as RIT transitions into more AI-integrated educational practices.\n\nWe have already launched an interdisciplinary master\u2019s degree in Artificial Intelligence. This program, supported by faculty from multiple colleges, is designed to help students develop well-rounded skill sets in designing, developing, and deploying AI systems, while also understanding and analyzing AI\u2019s impact on policy and society. Saunders College of Business is also integrating AI into all their program curricula, from business analytics to supply chain management to hospitality.\n\nIn the coming years, higher education will play a crucial role in retooling and \u201cupskilling\u201d those already in the workforce as AI continues to change how work is accomplished, and jobs are transformed or eliminated. As the HBR article concludes, \u201cCompanies have a lot to gain by teaming up with educational institutions in their reskilling efforts.\u201d\n\nOne noteworthy initiative, started in October 2024, is the National Applied Artificial Intelligence Consortium (NAAIC), funded by a $2.8 million grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation. The consortium, composed of Miami Dade College, Houston Community College, and Maricopa County Community College District, will offer AI-focused associate and bachelor\u2019s degrees, as well as certificates, and serve as models for universities and companies as they address the challenges of AI.\n\nNAAIC is strongly linked with industry, including such companies as Intel, AWS, Microsoft, Dell, IBM and NVIDIA. These industry leaders will play a critical role in contributing AI resources and guidance to the schools as they build and revise certificates and degree programs that are relevant and meet industry needs. Similarly, all schools would be well served to collaborate with industry in order to better define their programs to meet quickly evolving market needs.\n\nAs AI reshapes the future of work, educational institutions across the country are ramping up efforts to prepare students and professionals at all levels\u2014from workforce training to advanced degrees. This advanced knowledge will allow us to make an immediate, and positive, impact in this new AI-enabled world.\n\nJacqueline Mozrall is Dean, RIT Saunders College of Business.",

However, a second wave could lead to the automation of more jobs amid rapid advances in AI.\n\nAnalysing 22,000 tasks in the economy covering every type of job, the IPPR said 11% of tasks currently done by workers were at risk. This could, though, increase to 59% of tasks in the second wave as technologies develop to handle increasingly complex processes.\n\nIt said routine cognitive tasks \u2013 including database management, scheduling and stocktaking \u2013 were already at risk, with potential to displace entry level and part-time jobs in secretarial work, administration and customer services.\n\nHowever, the second wave of AI adoption could impact non-routine tasks involving the creation of databases, copywriting and graphic design, which would affect increasingly higher earning jobs.\n\nWomen would be significantly more affected, as \u201cthey are more likely to work in the most exposed occupations, such as secretarial and administrative occupations\u201d, the IPPR said.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario for the second wave of AI, 7.9m jobs could be displaced, the report said, with any gains for the economy from productivity improvements cancelled out with zero growth in GDP within three to five years.\n\nIn a best-case scenario for full augmentation of the workforce with generative AI, no jobs would be lost, while the size of the economy could be increased by 4%, or about \u00a392bn a year.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "At a glance\n\nAmid tightening labor markets and a slowdown in productivity growth, Europe and the United States face shifts in labor demand, spurred by AI and automation. Our updated modeling of the future of work finds that demand for workers in STEM-related, healthcare, and other high-skill professions would rise, while demand for occupations such as office workers, production workers, and customer service representatives would decline. By 2030, in a midpoint adoption scenario, up to 30 percent of current hours worked could be automated, accelerated by generative AI (gen AI). Efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, an aging workforce, and growth in e-commerce, as well as infrastructure and technology spending and overall economic growth, could also shift employment demand.\n\nBy 2030, Europe could require up to 12 million occupational transitions, double the prepandemic pace. In the United States, required transitions could reach almost 12 million, in line with the prepandemic norm. Both regions navigated even higher levels of labor market shifts at the height of the COVID-19 period, suggesting that they can handle this scale of future job transitions. The pace of occupational change is broadly similar among countries in Europe, although the specific mix reflects their economic variations.\n\nBusinesses will need a major skills upgrade. Demand for technological and social and emotional skills could rise as demand for physical and manual and higher cognitive skills stabilizes. Surveyed executives in Europe and the United States expressed a need not only for advanced IT and data analytics but also for critical thinking, creativity, and teaching and training\u2014skills they report as currently being in short supply. Companies plan to focus on retraining workers, more than hiring or subcontracting, to meet skill needs.\n\nWorkers with lower wages face challenges of redeployment as demand reweights toward occupations with higher wages in both Europe and the United States. Occupations with lower wages are likely to see reductions in demand, and workers will need to acquire new skills to transition to better-paying work. If that doesn\u2019t happen, there is a risk of a more polarized labor market, with more higher-wage jobs than workers and too many workers for existing lower-wage jobs.\n\nChoices made today could revive productivity growth while creating better societal outcomes. Embracing the path of accelerated technology adoption with proactive worker redeployment could help Europe achieve an annual productivity growth rate of up to 3 percent through 2030. However, slow adoption would limit that to 0.3 percent, closer to today\u2019s level of productivity growth in Western Europe. Slow worker redeployment would leave millions unable to participate productively in the future of work.\n\nBusinessman and skilled worker in high tech enterprise, using VR glasses - stock photo\n\nDemand will change for a range of occupations through 2030, including growth in STEM- and healthcare-related occupations, among others\n\nThis report focuses on labor markets in nine major economies in the European Union along with the United Kingdom, in comparison with the United States. Technology, including most recently the rise of gen AI, along with other factors, will spur changes in the pattern of labor demand through 2030. Our study, which uses an updated version of the McKinsey Global Institute future of work model, seeks to quantify the occupational transitions that will be required and the changing nature of demand for different types of jobs and skills.\n\nOur methodology We used methodology consistent with other McKinsey Global Institute reports on the future of work to model trends of job changes at the level of occupations, activities, and skills. For this report, we focused our analysis on the 2022\u201330 period. Our model estimates net changes in employment demand by sector and occupation; we also estimate occupational transitions, or the net number of workers that need to change in each type of occupation, based on which occupations face declining demand by 2030 relative to current employment in 2022. We included ten countries in Europe: nine EU members\u2014the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Sweden\u2014and the United Kingdom. For the United States, we build on estimates published in our 2023 report Generative AI and the future of work in America. We included multiple drivers in our modeling: automation potential, net-zero transition, e-commerce growth, remote work adoption, increases in income, aging populations, technology investments, and infrastructure investments. Two scenarios are used to bookend the work-automation model: \u201clate\u201d and \u201cearly.\u201d For Europe, we modeled a \u201cfaster\u201d scenario and a \u201cslower\u201d one. For the faster scenario, we use the midpoint\u2014the arithmetical average between our late and early scenarios. For the slower scenario, we use a \u201cmid late\u201d trajectory, an arithmetical average between a late adoption scenario and the midpoint scenario. For the United States, we use the midpoint scenario, based on our earlier research. We also estimate the productivity effects of automation, using GDP per full-time-equivalent (FTE) employee as the measure of productivity. We assumed that workers displaced by automation rejoin the workforce at 2022 productivity levels, net of automation, and in line with the expected 2030 occupational mix.\n\nAmid tightening labor markets and a slowdown in productivity growth, Europe and the United States face shifts in labor demand, spurred not only by AI and automation but also by other trends, including efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, an aging population, infrastructure spending, technology investments, and growth in e-commerce, among others (see sidebar, \u201cOur methodology\u201d).\n\nOur analysis finds that demand for occupations such as health professionals and other STEM-related professionals would grow by 17 to 30 percent between 2022 and 2030, (Exhibit 1).\n\nBy contrast, demand for workers in food services, production work, customer services, sales, and office support\u2014all of which declined over the 2012\u201322 period\u2014would continue to decline until 2030. These jobs involve a high share of repetitive tasks, data collection, and elementary data processing\u2014all activities that automated systems can handle efficiently.\n\nUp to 30 percent of hours worked could be automated by 2030, boosted by gen AI, leading to millions of required occupational transitions\n\nBy 2030, our analysis finds that about 27 percent of current hours worked in Europe and 30 percent of hours worked in the United States could be automated, accelerated by gen AI. Our model suggests that roughly 20 percent of hours worked could still be automated even without gen AI, implying a significant acceleration.\n\nThese trends will play out in labor markets in the form of workers needing to change occupations. By 2030, under the faster adoption scenario we modeled, Europe could require up to 12.0 million occupational transitions, affecting 6.5 percent of current employment. That is double the prepandemic pace (Exhibit 2). Under a slower scenario we modeled for Europe, the number of occupational transitions needed would amount to 8.5 million, affecting 4.6 percent of current employment. In the United States, required transitions could reach almost 12.0 million, affecting 7.5 percent of current employment. Unlike Europe, this magnitude of transitions is broadly in line with the prepandemic norm.\n\nBoth regions navigated even higher levels of labor market shifts at the height of the COVID-19 period. While these were abrupt and painful to many, given the forced nature of the shifts, the experience suggests that both regions have the ability to handle this scale of future job transitions.\n\nSmiling female PhD student discussing with man at desk in innovation lab - stock photo\n\nBusinesses will need a major skills upgrade\n\nThe occupational transitions noted above herald substantial shifts in workforce skills in a future in which automation and AI are integrated into the workplace (Exhibit 3). Workers use multiple skills to perform a given task, but for the purposes of our quantification, we identified the predominant skill used.\n\nDemand for technological skills could see substantial growth in Europe and in the United States (increases of 25 percent and 29 percent, respectively, in hours worked by 2030 compared to 2022) under our midpoint scenario of automation adoption (which is the faster scenario for Europe).\n\nDemand for social and emotional skills could rise by 11 percent in Europe and by 14 percent in the United States. Underlying this increase is higher demand for roles requiring interpersonal empathy and leadership skills. These skills are crucial in healthcare and managerial roles in an evolving economy that demands greater adaptability and flexibility.\n\nConversely, demand for work in which basic cognitive skills predominate is expected to decline by 14 percent. Basic cognitive skills are required primarily in office support or customer service roles, which are highly susceptible to being automated by AI. Among work characterized by these basic cognitive skills experiencing significant drops in demand are basic data processing and literacy, numeracy, and communication.\n\nDemand for work in which higher cognitive skills predominate could also decline slightly, according to our analysis. While creativity is expected to remain highly sought after, with a potential increase of 12 percent by 2030, work activities characterized by other advanced cognitive skills such as advanced literacy and writing, along with quantitative and statistical skills, could decline by 19 percent.\n\nDemand for physical and manual skills, on the other hand, could remain roughly level with the present. These skills remain the largest share of workforce skills, representing about 30 percent of total hours worked in 2022. Growth in demand for these skills between 2022 and 2030 could come from the build-out of infrastructure and higher investment in low-emissions sectors, while declines would be in line with continued automation in production work.\n\nBusiness executives report skills shortages today and expect them to worsen\n\nA survey we conducted of C-suite executives in five countries shows that companies are already grappling with skills challenges, including a skills mismatch, particularly in technological, higher cognitive, and social and emotional skills: about one-third of the more than 1,100 respondents report a shortfall in these critical areas. At the same time, a notable number of executives say they have enough employees with basic cognitive skills and, to a lesser extent, physical and manual skills.\n\nWithin technological skills, companies in our survey reported that their most significant shortages are in advanced IT skills and programming, advanced data analysis, and mathematical skills. Among higher cognitive skills, significant shortfalls are seen in critical thinking and problem structuring and in complex information processing. About 40 percent of the executives surveyed pointed to a shortage of workers with these skills, which are needed for working alongside new technologies (Exhibit 4).\n\nTwo IT co-workers code on laptop or technology for testing, web design or online startup - stock photo\n\nCompanies see retraining as key to acquiring needed skills and adapting to the new work landscape\n\nSurveyed executives expect significant changes to their workforce skill levels and worry about not finding the right skills by 2030. More than one in four survey respondents said that failing to capture the needed skills could directly harm financial performance and indirectly impede their efforts to leverage the value from AI.\n\nTo acquire the skills they need, companies have three main options: retraining, hiring, and contracting workers. Our survey suggests that executives are looking at all three options, with retraining the most widely reported tactic planned to address the skills mismatch: on average, out of companies that mentioned retraining as one of their tactics to address skills mismatch, executives said they would retrain 32 percent of their workforce. The scale of retraining needs varies in degree. For example, respondents in the automotive industry expect 36 percent of their workforce to be retrained, compared with 28 percent in the financial services industry. Out of those who have mentioned hiring or contracting as their tactics to address the skills mismatch, executives surveyed said they would hire an average of 23 percent of their workforce and contract an average of 18 percent.\n\nOccupational transitions will affect high-, medium-, and low-wage workers differently\n\nAll ten European countries we examined for this report may see increasing demand for top-earning occupations. By contrast, workers in the two lowest-wage-bracket occupations could be three to five times more likely to have to change occupations compared to the top wage earners, our analysis finds. The disparity is much higher in the United States, where workers in the two lowest-wage-bracket occupations are up to 14 times more likely to face occupational shifts than the highest earners. In Europe, the middle-wage population could be twice as affected by occupational transitions as the same population in United States, representing 7.3 percent of the working population who might face occupational transitions.\n\nEnhancing human capital at the same time as deploying the technology rapidly could boost annual productivity growth\n\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\n\nOrganizations and policy makers have choices to make; the way they approach AI and automation, along with human capital augmentation, will affect economic and societal outcomes.\n\nWe have attempted to quantify at a high level the potential effects of different stances to AI deployment on productivity in Europe. Our analysis considers two dimensions. The first is the adoption rate of AI and automation technologies. We consider the faster scenario and the late scenario for technology adoption. Faster adoption would unlock greater productivity growth potential but also, potentially, more short-term labor disruption than the late scenario.\n\nThe second dimension we consider is the level of automated worker time that is redeployed into the economy. This represents the ability to redeploy the time gained by automation and productivity gains (for example, new tasks and job creation). This could vary depending on the success of worker training programs and strategies to match demand and supply in labor markets.\n\nWe based our analysis on two potential scenarios: either all displaced workers would be able to fully rejoin the economy at a similar productivity level as in 2022 or only some 80 percent of the automated workers\u2019 time will be redeployed into the economy.\n\nExhibit 5 illustrates the various outcomes in terms of annual productivity growth rate. The top-right quadrant illustrates the highest economy-wide productivity, with an annual productivity growth rate of up to 3.1 percent. It requires fast adoption of technologies as well as full redeployment of displaced workers. The top-left quadrant also demonstrates technology adoption on a fast trajectory and shows a relatively high productivity growth rate (up to 2.5 percent). However, about 6.0 percent of total hours worked (equivalent to 10.2 million people not working) would not be redeployed in the economy. Finally, the two bottom quadrants depict the failure to adopt AI and automation, leading to limited productivity gains and translating into limited labor market disruptions.\n\nManagers discussing work while futuristic AI computer vision analyzing, ccanning production line - stock photo\n\nFour priorities for companies\n\nThe adoption of automation technologies will be decisive in protecting businesses\u2019 competitive advantage in an automation and AI era. To ensure successful deployment at a company level, business leaders can embrace four priorities.\n\nUnderstand the potential. Leaders need to understand the potential of these technologies, notably including how AI and gen AI can augment and automate work. This includes estimating both the total capacity that these technologies could free up and their impact on role composition and skills requirements. Understanding this allows business leaders to frame their end-to-end strategy and adoption goals with regard to these technologies.\n\nPlan a strategic workforce shift. Once they understand the potential of automation technologies, leaders need to plan the company\u2019s shift toward readiness for the automation and AI era. This requires sizing the workforce and skill needs, based on strategically identified use cases, to assess the potential future talent gap. From this analysis will flow details about the extent of recruitment of new talent, upskilling, or reskilling of the current workforce that is needed, as well as where to redeploy freed capacity to more value-added tasks.\n\nPrioritize people development. To ensure that the right talent is on hand to sustain the company strategy during all transformation phases, leaders could consider strengthening their capabilities to identify, attract, and recruit future AI and gen AI leaders in a tight market. They will also likely need to accelerate the building of AI and gen AI capabilities in the workforce. Nontechnical talent will also need training to adapt to the changing skills environment. Finally, leaders could deploy an HR strategy and operating model to fit the post\u2013gen AI workforce.\n\nPursue the executive-education journey on automation technologies. Leaders also need to undertake their own education journey on automation technologies to maximize their contributions to their companies during the coming transformation. This includes empowering senior managers to explore automation technologies implications and subsequently role model to others, as well as bringing all company leaders together to create a dedicated road map to drive business and employee value.\n\nAI and the toolbox of advanced new technologies are evolving at a breathtaking pace. For companies and policy makers, these technologies are highly compelling because they promise a range of benefits, including higher productivity, which could lift growth and prosperity. Yet, as this report has sought to illustrate, making full use of the advantages on offer will also require paying attention to the critical element of human capital. In the best-case scenario, workers\u2019 skills will develop and adapt to new technological challenges. Achieving this goal in our new technological age will be highly challenging\u2014but the benefits will be great.",

Technological advances often cause disruption \u2013 but historically, they have eventually fueled economic and employment growth ,\" the report noted.\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n\nA report released a year ago by economists at Goldman Sachs analyzed the potential impact of AI on the workforce in 900 different occupations and found that AI will likely have a \"significant\" impact on the labor market. Most jobs and industries \"are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI,\" the report said.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs report also noted the emergence of new technology such as AI has historically driven the creation of new jobs.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIt cited a study by economist David Autor, who found that about 60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn't exist in 1940, which the Goldman Sachs economists said implies that over 85% of employment growth in the last 80 years has been driven by technological innovations that lead to the creation of new occupations.",

        "text": "An economist has said, \"AI won't take your job, it's somebody using AI that will take your job.\"\n\nAI seems to be a positive for many workers, but some roles are more at risk of replacement.\n\nExperts advise skilling up and leaning into soft human skills as AI becomes embedded in work life.\n\nYou may have heard a version of the phrase, \"AI won't take your job, it's somebody using AI that will take your job.\"\n\nEconomist Richard Baldwin said the phrase at the 2023 World Economic Forum's Growth Summit, and variations of it have been mentioned since as people discuss the potential impacts of AI.\n\nBaldwin told BI he wasn't sure if he coined the phrase, but the message is that AI won't replace humans, but it will give those who embrace it an advantage in the workforce.\n\nIn the 12 months since Baldwin shared his perspective, interest in artificial intelligence has only increased. A recent survey by consulting firm Bain & Company found that 85% of the companies surveyed said adopting AI was a top-five priority.\n\nAs companies ramp up their AI offerings and begin restructuring their workforce, many are revisiting the question of whether AI will be a job killer or an enhancer.\n\nWhile it's still the early days of AI, we asked experts to weigh in. Should you be more worried about losing your job to a human using AI or to the AI itself?\n\nWorkers already see the benefit of AI at this stage\n\nBaldwin said that AI is like a lawn mower or a power drill \u2014 it makes your job easier but it doesn't replace the human behind it. Other experts seemed to share a similar mindset that it's not advanced enough to function without direction, and for the most part, it helps people do better at their jobs.\n\nRelated stories\n\nJasmine Escalera, a career coach at LiveCareer said incorporating AI can help automate repetitive tasks and \"free up time to focus on upskilling.\"\n\nMatt Betts, a research and development lead at leadership consulting firm RHR International, says it helps create efficiency so that consultants can focus on more impactful work, like interacting with the client.\n\nData has shown a similar trend that AI has helped many workers produce high-quality work in a shorter amount of time.\n\nOne study by MIT and Stanford from 2023 found that access to AI increased productivity by 14% on average, with a 34% impact on new or lower-skilled workers. A Morgan Stanley report indicated that workers with multiple income streams who used generative AI to increase their productivity made 21% more on average than those who didn't.\n\nAI may also be helping people land jobs. Career service LiveCareer surveyed 1,150 US workers in March and found that 85% of job seekers save time using AI for writing applications and 40% think AI improves their grammar, writing, and vocabulary.\n\nThe loss of some jobs is inevitable\n\nAI has already redefined a number of roles and even if it doesn't take all jobs, it's bound to replace some.\n\nIBM used to have 800 people working in HR and now has 60 because it was able to automate repetitive tasks, according to the company's marketing chief.\n\nKlarna seems to be following a similar trajectory. The company said in a blog post in February that its AI assistant was doing the work of \"700 full-time agents\" after pumping the brakes on hiring.\n\nOpenAI CTO Mira Murati also weighed in on the topic at a Dartmouth event on June 8 and turned heads when she said some creative jobs may disappear, but those that could be replaced by AI \"shouldn't have been there in the first place.\"\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey, a director of future and work at Oxford University, said that transportation and logistics are most likely to see outright automation moving forward. He also said warehousing, manufacturing, receptionists, cashiers, and translators are also roles that are moving toward automation or semi-automation.\n\nIt's a good idea to skill up\n\nA March Goldman Sachs report found over 300 million jobs around the world could be impacted by AI. But it's impossible to predict how exactly they will change.\n\nCareer coach Escalera said the best path forward is to lean into human soft skills while skilling up and \"adopting a mindset of continuous learning.\" For some who are hiring, AI is becoming a prerequisite.\n\nTripadvisor cofounder Steve Kaufer said on \"The Logan Bartlett Show\" that he asked candidates during interviews if they tried out new AI chatbots. He said software engineers who didn't experiment with AI tools usually didn't get the job.\n\n\"I just don't understand it,\" Kaufer said. \"And I probably don't want to work with that individual.\"\n\nCEO of global event company Empire Entertainment, J.B. Miller, said it's an \"essential new skill set,\" especially in an industry that involves improvising. He said it cuts down time and helps with generating ideas for set designs and talent sourcing. He asks all new hires what AI tools they use.\n\n\"There's no world where I could employ somebody who's like, I don't know how to use Excel or I don't know how to navigate the internet or do an internet search or something online like that,\" Miller said.\n\n\"I think that the same is true of some of these basic, AI tools,\" he added.",

        "text": "The book is called \" The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma .\" Published in 2023, it was written by AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman, who co-founded the research lab DeepMind. He sold it to Google in 2014 and now serves as CEO of Microsoft AI.\n\nBill Gates thinks everyone should read his \"favorite book on AI,\" one that predicts artificial intelligence will change what most jobs look like \u2014 across nearly every industry \u2014 within the next five years.\n\n\"It's the book I recommend more than any other on AI \u2014 to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks \u2014 because it offers something rare: a clear-eyed view of both the extraordinary opportunities and genuine risks ahead,\" Gates wrote in a blog post last month. DON'T MISS: How to use AI to be more productive and successful at work In the book, Suleyman predicted that rapid advances in AI development will completely change the way nearly every industry operates. He cited a 2023 study from consulting group McKinsey, which estimated roughly half of all \"work activities\" will become automated, starting as soon as 2030. The ramifications of AI \"will be hugely destabilizing for hundreds of millions who will, at the very least, need to re-skill and transition to new types of work,\" Suleyman wrote. More than 400 million global workers could need to transition to new jobs or roles, according to McKinsey. AI will help employees be more efficient \u2014 as in some cases it already does \u2014 but only at first, Suleyman wrote. \"These tools will only temporarily augment human intelligence,\" he wrote. \"They will make us smarter and more efficient for a time, and will unlock enormous amounts of economic growth, but they are fundamentally labor replacing.\"\n\nFrom physical manufacturing to \"cognitive labor,\" the AI revolution is set to touch basically every industry, Suleyman wrote. There will eventually be \"few areas\" where humans can outperform machines. AI will quickly outpace human workers at office tasks like administration, customer service and content creation, according to Suleyman. The increased input will likely result in two realities, he wrote. Employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. But not all of that work will go to humans, Suleyman notes: Employers will still opt for the \"abundance of ultra-low-cost equivalents\" whenever possible. Some positions are and will be more difficult for AI to replicate. Those include skilled trades like plumbers and electricians, as well as white collar roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. Still, nearly everyone will likely need to upskill \u2014 and learn how to incorporate this kind of technology into their current jobs \u2014 as AI services become more prevalent in every industry over the next several years. Many others will need to transition into entirely new careers, Suleyman wrote. That shift is already underway. A 2023 EY survey found that 41% of U.S. companies polled were implementing plans for training employees to work with AI products. Basic AI skills \u2014 like prompt engineering, machine learning and data literacy \u2014 are a key hiring factor for nearly 70% of employers, according to a March 2024 Slack Workforce Lab survey of more than 10,000 professionals.\n\nSome experts suggest the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. Artificial intelligence will create 78 million more positions than it eliminates by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicted earlier this month. But even AI optimists agree that huge changes in how people work are likely to result in a period of dramatic transition. New jobs enabled by AI's advances won't come soon enough to rescue large portions of the global workforce, Suleyman predicted in his book. AI will \"eliminate a lot of current jobs, [and] there will be classes of jobs that totally go away,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a May 2024 discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth.",

        "text": "More than four in 10 workers in a massive, global survey said they\u2019re threatened by the increasing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in their workplace.\n\nResponses to an ADP survey from nearly 35,000 workers in 18 countries explored new challenges and technologies reshaping the labor market. Among the top concerns: AI, with 42% citing it as a job threat.\n\nData and an evaluation of the results by ADP focused on how workers\u2019 priorities, expectations and feelings have shifted, including their sense of job security and how the implementation of AI in the workplace impacts that shift. The details are included in ADP\u2019s recently released \u201cPeople At Work 2024: A Global Workforce View\u201d annual report.\n\nEighty-five percent of workers believe AI will impact their job in the next two to three years, ADP\u2019s survey found. Among workers who say AI will help them every day, 70% say they have the skills they need to advance their career to the next level within three years. Of those who say AI will replace most of their existing functions, only 45% think they have the skills they need.\n\nADP\n\nWorkers in some ways have remained constant in their priorities; they still put great value on financial compensation and job security, for example. In other ways, however, they feel under siege from technology, stress, and changing workplace norms. ADP\u2019s report this year focused on a \u201cGreat Transition\u201d from a \u201ctroubled, pandemic-driven economy to a post-pandemic world.\u201d\n\nOverall, people feel better about their job security than they did a year ago, but they\u2019re now worried by the increasing presence of AI.\n\nThe survey results are backed by financial services market predictions that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. According to a 2023 report by investment bank Goldman Sachs, two-thirds of all jobs could be partially automated by AI. \u201cIf generative AI delivers on its promised capabilities, the labor market could face significant disruption,\u201d Goldman reported. \u201cAnd\u2026 generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.\u201d\n\nIn the US, office and administrative support jobs face the highest risks, with 46% of those jobs facing automation by AI, according to Goldman Sachs. That figure is 44% for legal work and 37% for tasks within architecture and engineering.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that worker displacement from automation has historically been offset by creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment growth,\u201d Goldman Sachs noted. \u201cThe combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and higher productivity for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a productivity boom that raises economic growth substantially, although the timing of such a boom is hard to predict.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nGoldman\u2019s report suggested genAI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by just under 1.5% over a 10-year period after widespread adoption, although the boost could be much smaller or larger depending on the difficulty level of tasks AI will be able to perform and how many jobs are automated.\n\nOf the ADP survey respondents, 17% said AI has the power to make their work easier and were less likely to feel insecure about losing their jobs. And 43% think having AI on the job will be a good thing.\n\nWhile most (60%) agree they have the skills needed to advance their career in the next three years, less than half (47%) feel their employer invests in the skills they need to grow professionally. As workers grow less confident in their employers\u2019 willingness or ability to invest in them, however, they grow more concerned about AI muscling in on their jobs. Workers who most fear AI have the least confidence (45%) that they have the skills they\u2019ll need.\n\nA widening IT skills shortage is dogging organizations in all industries and across all regions, IDC research shows. But far from eliminating most jobs, AI is expected to boost the productivity of the existing workforce and help to create new roles.\n\nIDC\n\n\u201cFor all the concern about job loss\u2026, many AI-based changes to work have led to new job opportunities, including enabling workers to focus on more engaging and innovative tasks,\u201d IDC\u2019 said. \u201cAI use cases are creating new opportunities for content creation, education, entertainment, and content generation, provoking a shift in thinking about the role of AI on jobs and roles.\n\nIDC data indicates that 32% of business and IT leaders now expect advancing AI constructs such as genAI to save time and improve productivity. For example, genAI tools support greater access to diverse knowledge resources by enabling employees to conversationally access them using natural language queries.\n\n\u201cGenAI and skills are increasingly tightly related: Organizations spanning all industries and geographies face a widening shortage of all IT tech skills, regardless of those skills relating to security, cloud, IT service management, or AI itself,\u201d IDC said. \u201cGenAI tools used in conjunction with or inside of tech training platforms can and do accelerate training.\u201d\n\nNearly two-thirds (62%) of about 1,100 IT leaders surveyed earlier this year told IDC that a lack of skills has resulted in missed revenue growth objectives \u2014 and more than 60% say it has led to quality problems and a loss of customer satisfaction. IDC predicts that by 2026, more than 90% of organizations worldwide will feel similar pain, amounting to some $5.5 trillion in losses caused by product delays, impaired competitiveness, and loss of business.\n\n\u201cThere is no escaping it: The time to plan for AI skills and roles is now. \u2026The question is not whether enterprises must skill up employees for the age of AI, but when and how they will do it,\u201d IDC wrote in its report.\n\nAt the same time, many organizations are still asking whether the rapidly evolving technology will profoundly change jobs and skills development at a fundamental level. \u201cAutomation has long impacted human activities, most notably during the industrial era when machines rapidly replaced the manual work of humans,\u201d IDC said.\n\nThe impact of AI and genAI varies by profession and industry, with creative and engagement-based skill sets and work being affected first. Marketers, customer support teams, web designers, professional services groups, healthcare roles, and many other positions are already seeing changes in their work practices from AI.\n\nThe same IDC data shows that 29% of business and IT leaders expect AI and genAI to enable faster decision timing for back-office centers of leadership like HR, operations, and finance. As compared to two years ago, businesses are changing their narratives around AI enablement to see what it can do for the business and its workforce rather than worrying about what uncontrollable challenges it could pose.",

        "text": "On June 19, Dartmouth College's school of engineering held a discussion with Murati about the potential effects OpenAI's tools, such as ChatGPT, may have on different industries. During the conversation, the Dartmouth alum was asked if they would be capable of writing scripts and making films.\n\nOpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati says AI may help expand humans' creativity \u2014 but the technology could wipe out some creative jobs as well.\n\n\"It certainly can do that as a tool,\" she said. \"I expect that we will collaborate with it and it's going to make our creativity expand.\" OpenAI's tools will \"lower the barrier for anyone to think of themselves as creative,\" she added. However, she also said AI tools could have a potentially disruptive impact on creative industries. \"Some creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn't have been there in the first place if the content that comes out of it is not very high quality,\" she said. Ultimately, \"I really believe that using it as a tool for education [and] creativity will expand our intelligence and creativity and imagination.\"\n\nWhen it comes to whether generative AI tools will be able to completely replace human creativity, the answer tends to be complicated for a few reasons. For one, generative AI learns differently than humans. Large language models, image generators and other generative AI tools use powerful algorithms to identify patterns in the datasets they're trained on and use that information to generate new image, text or audio outputs based on users' prompts. But humans still don't have a clear understanding of how we learn, retain knowledge and develop creativity, says Theo Omtzigt, chief technology officer at Lemurian Labs. \"If we do not have a mathematical understanding, or a scientific understanding, of what creates consciousness or creativity, we have no mechanism to instill it in an artificial system,\" he told CNBC Make It in December.",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence continues to take up more space in various industries, and businesses are increasingly integrating it to handle tasks that were once managed by human employees.\n\nIn India, Suumit Shah, CEO of Dukaan, an e-commerce company, decided to take automation to an extreme level. In the summer of 2023, he made a bold decision: laying off 90% of his workforce and replacing them with AI-powered chatbots.\n\nThis drastic move was aimed at cutting operational costs and improving efficiency, but it also sparked a heated ethical debate. A year later, Shah has released the first assessment of his decision, and he considers it a success.\n\nAi-Driven Customer Service\u2014Faster, but at What Cost?\n\nShah claims that the implementation of AI in his company has significantly improved customer service. He points out that response times have dropped from nearly two minutes to almost instantaneous replies.\n\nAdditionally, the resolution time for customer issues has been reduced dramatically, from over two hours to just a few minutes. These improvements, he asserts, have led to greater efficiency and a better customer experience.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the human aspect of customer service is irreplaceable and that automation at this scale could set a dangerous precedent for the future of employment.\n\nA Growing Debate on AI Replacing Human Jobs\n\nThe replacement of human workers by AI is a topic that has fueled discussions for decades, often portrayed in science fiction as a future where machines dominate the workforce.\n\nToday, this debate is becoming increasingly relevant as AI technology continues to evolve and expand its capabilities. Some view the rise of AI as a positive transformation, a tool that can enhance productivity by taking over repetitive and time-consuming tasks.\n\nOthers see it as a looming threat, warning that widespread automation will leave many unemployed and struggling to adapt to a new job market.\n\nThe case of Dukaan is a striking example of how AI is reshaping industries at an accelerated pace. While businesses benefit from cost reductions and increased efficiency, the mass layoffs raise concerns about the long-term impact on employment.\n\nThe balance between embracing AI-driven solutions and ensuring job security remains a pressing issue. Companies must decide whether to fully automate their operations or find a middle ground that allows for both technological advancements and human employment.\n\nThe Future of AI in the Workforce\n\nDukaan\u2019s transformation is just one instance of a much larger trend. Major corporations around the world, including Amazon, Google, and Tesla, are heavily investing in automation. The question is no longer whether AI will take over certain jobs, but how quickly and extensively it will happen.\n\nAs businesses increasingly shift toward AI-driven operations, society must confront the reality of what this means for millions of workers worldwide. For now, Suumit Shah is standing by his decision, calling it a success from a business standpoint.",

        "text": "Some workers could lose their jobs due to AI, even if the tech doesn't directly replace them.\n\nSome companies have laid off workers to help clear the way for their massive AI investments.\n\nHowever, these investments are also expected to create AI-related jobs.\n\nEven if AI doesn't replace you, it could still be to blame if you get laid off.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, global tech companies have laid off more than 350,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. This includes US giants like Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\nIndustry executives and experts have pointed to several reasons for the layoffs, including overhiring during the pandemic. But as tech firms plan to invest billions of dollars in generative AI technologies, there's been another explanation for job cuts.\n\nThey need money to fund their AI spending.\n\nIn the coming years, companies will spend an estimated $1 trillion in combined generative AI investments that will go toward data centers, chips, and the power grid, according to a report from Goldman Sachs. To help fund these investments \u2014 and clear the way for the AI boom \u2014 more companies could cut jobs. While there's been a mountain of speculation about if and when AI technologies like ChatGPT could displace workers, their near-term impact on job losses could be less about job replacement and more about the cost of AI investments. Of course, for workers who lose their jobs, the end result is the same.\n\nThis is already playing out.\n\nIn a February earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg told analysts that Meta had to lay off workers and manage costs \"so we can invest in these long-term, ambitious visions around AI.\"\n\nIn a memo published in January, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told employees that the company would be laying off more workers to make room for other investments, including AI.\n\n\"The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices,\" he wrote.\n\nLast November, Amazon laid off hundreds of workers in its Alexa division. Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Fire TV, told his team via email that the company would be \"maximizing our resources and efforts focused on generative AI,\" leading it to \"discontinue some initiatives.\"\n\n\"A lot of this is really the shift and spend toward the AI revolution,\" Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, told The Hill in February after a series of tech layoffs.\n\nIt's not just Big Tech. A survey of 1,200 CEOs from large companies across the globe, conducted last fall by FT Longitude on behalf of EY, found that 100% of their businesses were making or planning to make \"significant investments in generative AI.\" When asked how they planned to fund these investments, 71% of CEOs said they planned to \"reallocate capital\" from their technology budgets or other investment budgets \u2014 34% said they planned to raise new capital.\n\n\"Whenever a new technology emerges and is found to be useful, companies decide to invest in that technology and sometimes invest less in other areas,\" Oded Netzer, a Columbia Business School professor and AI expert, told Business Insider via email.\n\nTo be sure, these investments in AI are also expected to lead to significant hiring for AI-related jobs \u2014 even if AI technologies begin to replace some workers. Additionally, it remains to be seen how much AI spending will necessitate job cuts in other business areas, Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at the University of Oxford, told Business Insider via email.\n\n\"I think it is true that companies are revising their business models in the light of recent developments in AI, cutting back on investment and jobs in other domains in the process,\" he said. \"But the magnitude of this shift is still hard to tell.\"\n\nThe risks of AI job replacement remains to be seen\n\nIn the big picture, Netzer said he expects AI technologies to be an \"enhancer rather than a replacer of jobs\" in the years ahead.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"For many jobs, AI is likely to enhance our job, allowing us to spend more time on the things we enjoy doing and less time on the mundane,\" he said.\n\nHe gave the example of a physician who has to devote precious time with patients typing notes on the computer.\n\n\"We are not far from AI making a transcription of the patient meeting,\" he said. \"But this in unlikely to lead to fewer doctors but rather the doctors being able to spend more quality time with the patient.\"\n\nHowever, some companies have begun citing AI as a reason for job cuts or hiring cutbacks. A Fiverr survey conducted in May of 1,001 US managers, business leaders, and decision-makers who had done layoffs in the prior six months found that the top reason cited for the layoffs was \"new technology, where AI could increase efficiencies and reduce head count.\"\n\nBenedikt Frey pointed to translators as one profession that has seen fewer employment opportunities due to generative AI, per his research.\n\n\"We are indeed already seeing AI having an impact on jobs,\" he said.\n\nHave you lost your job due to AI?

        "text": "AI is presenting an opportunity to boost productivity for various sectors, but will this journey to growth come at the cost of people\u2019s jobs?\n\nAI has caused a stir around the world for the benefits it can bring to organisations, but progress can come at a cost \u2013 in this case, an impact to jobs.\n\nThere have been national and international reports about the potential impact AI could have on the job market over the next decade. A report at the end of May suggests that generative AI alone could boost Ireland\u2019s gross domestic product by between \u20ac40bn and \u20ac45bn in roughly 10 years. But it also warned that roughly 6pc of Irish jobs \u2013 roughly 160,000 positions \u2013 are expected to have more than half of their work activities displaced by the automation provided by AI.\n\nThese warnings mirror concerns shared by other reports about generative AI over the past couple of years. A Goldman Sachs report in 2023 predicted that up to 300m full-time jobs could be lost to generative AI worldwide. But both reports noted that automation replacing jobs would likely also lead to the creation of new roles and occupations.\n\nBut that fact may not help individuals who find their type of job being taken over by AI models. The previous reports suggested that certain sectors and job types are more at risk than others, such as clerical support roles.\n\nTo learn more about the potential AI has to help or hinder the job market, SiliconRepublic.com spoke to Michal Szymczak, the head of AI strategy at Cork-based consultancy company Zartis.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been refocusing and reshaping the company to address the AI needs that are happening around the market,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have lots of customers coming to us asking about those things.\u201d\n\nThe cost of productivity\n\nSzymczak believes that, overall, AI is not as much of a threat to jobs as certain reports make it seem and agrees with the idea that new jobs will be created as a result of this evolving technology.\n\n\u201cWe believe jobs will not be lost as a headcount or it might be even an increase,\u201d Szymczak said. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s more of a transformation than a removal of positions. So we\u2019ll be doing things differently with the help of AI.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll be more performant. This way we can focus on things that actually matter and kind of pass on the mundane activities [such as] report writing and similar to AI.\u201d\n\nBut he also noted that this \u201cstill doesn\u2019t mean individuals won\u2019t be affected\u201d by the changes AI will bring. He presented this in a simple example \u2013 if AI hypothetically improved everyone\u2019s work performance by 25pc, then in a team, the \u201cfifth person\u201d would no longer be required.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s very likely that individual, and multiply this by a number, will be affected one way or another,\u201d he said. \u201c It\u2019s not like they\u2019re not going to be in the middle of this entire thing, but it\u2019s very likely with time these jobs are just going to transform and lots of new ones are going to appear.\u201d\n\nBut while AI is being presented as the threat to these jobs, Szymczak believes it is just one aspect of a simple reality \u2013 that \u201cthe world is speeding up\u201d. As a result, there are individuals whose jobs will be at risk for multiple reasons, not just because of AI.\n\n\u201cSo, whether that\u2019s AI or another level of machine learning or another level of automation, or just a new person coming out of university with the excitement and the energy to do something and disrupt the particular team, you were always at risk,\u201d Szymczak said.\n\n\u201cYour position was always at risk. Maybe your managers now have more reasons to think about changes. But from my perspective, everybody should at least consider looking at those tools, understanding them, and thinking practically, what are the use cases that apply to them?\n\n\u201cAI will not replace you, we say. But another human using AI, absolutely will.\u201d\n\nLearning new types of tools and technology might not be so simple for everyone however, especially if a certain type of job or sector is at risk of dramatic job reductions from a new technology. Meanwhile, recent surveys suggest many organisations are planning to reduce staff numbers by using AI in the next few years, so the new jobs that replace lost ones may take time to come to fruition.\n\nEarlier this week, Thomas Deegan of Mackin EHS spoke about the rise of automation technology in certain sectors in Ireland and how they can present a way for businesses to reduce their labour costs massively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that unfortunately, we\u2019ve seen it over and over again in the past, that technology does remove jobs,\u201d Deegan said. \u201cBut also, new jobs come out of that technology.\u201d\n\nA quicker path to seniority?\n\nBut its not all necessarily bad news \u2013 Szymczak also said AI has the potential to boost pathways in organisations, particularly by making it easier for entry-level employees to get up to speed and rise in a position.\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019m looking at it is we\u2019ll be bridging the gap between very experienced people and knowledgeable people who have been through a number of projects \u2013 whatever the industry \u2013 and those who are entering the job and just need, five, 10 years to become seniors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be bridging that way quicker, because first of all, now the AI can help those people get up to speed with those projects, get the gaps in their knowledge or experience addressed without the need for the senior ones to be overlooking the junior team members.\u201d\n\nAI is also presenting other opportunities for those entering the jobs market, with some tools on offer to help jobseekers ensure their applications make the most impact.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

A significant portion of BPO companies' customer support, sales, and marketing services has transitioned to AI. Entry-level jobs, especially in voice services, are increasingly being taken over by AI,\" he said.\n\nThis transition began a year and a half ago, with a significant shift occurring last year and this year.\n\nFor example, a pizza company now can use AI to take phone orders, detailing which pizza the customers want.\n\nAccording to him, as companies realised that they could replace outsourced human tasks with AI, they began preparing their platforms for this change.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, companies are increasingly requesting secondary level jobs, such as statement processing, balance transfers, and handling confidential information -- services that require more sophisticated human resources.\n\nImtiaz Ilahi, managing director of the GraphicPeople, said AI is replacing the basic image processing jobs such as automated image editing, background removal etc.\n\nKowser Ahmed, CEO of The KOW Company, a studio image and 3D post-production company, said AI is increasing his company's productivity.\n\n\"Earlier, I could process 25,000 images, but now I can process 40,000 images with the same human resource,\" he said.\n\n\"So, AI is not here to take all our jobs, rather it will expedite our jobs,\" he added.\n\nHowever, he said 20 percent to 30 percent of the jobs in a company could be lost to AI if that company cannot maintain a proper growth trajectory.\n\nRussel T Ahmed, president of the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS), said the immediate impact of AI in technology service companies is the recalculation of job hours due to AI's efficiency.\n\n\"Some of the companies that outsource their jobs from Bangladesh are reducing the man-hour -- the amount of work performed by an average worker in one hour -- as they now think AI-led automation reduces the time needed for tasks,\" he added.\n\nWahid Sharif, president of the Bangladesh Association of Contact Center and Outsourcing, said the impact of AI will be felt in entry level jobs.\n\n\"As the companies now can give the answer of basic questions and frequently asked questions with chatbots and AI technologies, they are reducing some dependency on humans,\" he said.\n\n\"The entry-level jobs will eventually be abolished,\" Sharif added.\n\nHowever, he said the domestic players who provide services in Bangla face no immediate threat from AI.\n\n\"The proficiency of AI in Bangla, unlike English and other languages, has not yet developed significantly. However, in the future, AI is expected to learn Bangla, and its impact will become evident then,\" Sharif added.\n\nTo address the challenges faced by AI, Musnad E Ahmed, founder of SkyTech, said he is setting up a software team and planning to develop AI voice services for clients.\n\n\"We are building the software and digital marketing wings as I think no entry level tasks will exist in two years,\" he added.\n\nAhmed of BASIS said the government, industry and academia should sit as soon as possible on how Bangladesh can translate the challenges posed by AI into opportunities.\n\n\"Immediate action is necessary as AI may be making another significant leap as we speak,\" he added.",

The focus should be on leveraging AI as an assistant to amplify your capabilities rather than fearing it as a replacement,\" he explained.\n\nNasdaq-listed Freshworks, which is the provider of people-first AI service software, in October unveiled Freddy AI, a conversational platform. \"Conversations are one of the first places where you\u2019ll see AI\u2019s impact.

        "text": "Forget artificial intelligence breaking free of human control and taking over the world. A far more pressing concern is how today\u2019s generative AI tools will transform the labor market. Some experts envisage a world of increased productivity and job satisfaction; others, a landscape of mass unemployment and social upheaval.\n\nSomeone with a bird's-eye view of the situation is Mary Daly, CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, part of the national system responsible for setting monetary policy, maintaining a stable financial system, and ensuring maximal employment. Daly, a labor market economist by training, is especially interested in how generative AI might change the labor market picture.\n\nDaly spoke with WIRED senior editor Will Knight over Zoom. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou\u2019ve been talking to early adopter companies about their use of generative AI. What are you seeing\u2014or to ask the question on many people\u2019s minds, are workers being replaced?\n\nMore firms than I would have imagined are already looking at it. Some are going to have more opportunities to replace workers, and some more to augment, But overall what I'm seeing is that no firm is using it as a replacement tool alone.\n\nOne person I talked to, her company invested in generative AI and used it to help write descriptions of items that they have for sale. They have hundreds of thousands of items, but not all of them are high-margin or are interesting to write about. And so they can keep adding more copywriting staff, or they could use generative AI to write first drafts on these items. Copywriters become auditors, and they do more interesting work.\n\nHow confident are you that generative AI won\u2019t eliminate jobs overall?\n\nTechnology has never reduced net employment over time for the country. If you look at technology over multiple centuries, what you see is that the impact lands somewhere in the middle, not necessarily dead-set in the middle, but somewhere in there, and where we end up depends a lot on how we engage with the technology.\n\nWhen I think of generative AI\u2014or AI writ large\u2014what I see is an opportunity. You can replace people, you can augment people, and you can create new opportunities for people. But you do have winners and losers. I came of age as an economist in the computerization era. That computer surge and the productivity that came with it clearly produced inequalities.\n\nAI in general, but especially generative AI, is an opportunity to assist those middle-skilled people in being more productive. But that's our choice, and that requires a lot of thinking on our part.\n\nSo white-collar workers could, in theory, be superpowered by AI. How can we ensure companies deploy the technology that way?\n\nBefore we ever get to compel, I think we could start with educate, and a tight labor market actually helps us. In a market where people with a computer science degree are harder to come by, companies basically get pushed by their own motive to be profitable and productive. They ask, \u2018How can I utilize less expensive talent more effectively?\u2019 I do believe companies\u2019 thinking naturally tends toward replacing workers, because it's easier to think that way, but this isn't set in stone.\n\nThe companies that are developing and selling AI models and tools don\u2019t seem to think that way. They seem exclusively focused on how AI can replace humans.",

Debates centre primarily around the possibility of AI displacing some human workers. Predicting the effects of technological transformation on the labour market is challenging. This is especially true for AI given the uncertainty surrounding the breadth of its potential; the pace of its development and implementation; and how workers, businesses and governments might react and adapt.\n\nPast studies on technological transformation examined the potential impact of automation on the Canadian labour market (Frenette and Frank, 2020). Automation is generally understood to be the use of machines to perform simple, routine and non-cognitive tasks. AI , on the other hand, can perform complex, non-routine and cognitive tasks. AI \u2019s capabilities are growing, and it is unclear how powerful it may be in the future.\n\nWhile it is difficult to predict the net impact of AI on jobs in Canada, Mehdi and Morissette (2024)\u2014integrating data from the 2016 and 2021 censuses of population with data from the Occupational Information Network\u2014offer some experimental estimates of occupational exposure to AI using the methodology developed by Felten, Raj and Seamans (2021) and Pizzinelli et al. (2023). The measure used is the complementarity-adjusted AI occupational exposure index, which can classify jobs into three AI groups using the median AI occupational exposure index and complementarity scores: (1) high exposure and low complementarity, (2) high exposure and high complementarity, and (3) low exposure (regardless of the degree of complementarity). The first two groups consist of jobs that may be highly exposed to AI , but the first group may have relatively more tasks that could be replaced by AI in the future, while the second group may have relatively more tasks that are highly complementary with AI . The third group of jobs are those that may be less exposed to AI than the first two groups, regardless of the degree of complementarity.\n\nEmployers may not immediately replace human labour with AI , even if it is technologically feasible to do so, because of financial, legal and institutional constraints. Consequently, exposure to AI does not necessarily imply a risk of job loss. At the very least, it could imply a certain degree of job transformation. Given the uncertainty surrounding AI , the experimental estimates presented here should be interpreted with caution. Only time will tell how the impact of AI will unfold.\n\nThe majority of workers in Canada are in jobs that may be highly exposed to job transformation related to artificial intelligence, but about half of them could benefit from it\n\nIn May 2021, 31% of employees aged 18 to 64 in Canada were in jobs that may be highly exposed to AI and relatively less complementary with it, 29% were in jobs that may be highly exposed to and highly complementary with AI , and 40% were in jobs that may not be highly exposed to AI . These findings were largely unchanged compared with those of May 2016 and are consistent with international evidence from other advanced economies, such as the United States (Cazzaniga et al. , 2024)\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the potential for AI to transform a broad set of occupations, regardless of skill level. Jobs that could be highly exposed to AI -related job transformation are generally those that require higher education. Despite this, professions such as doctors, nurses, teachers and electrical engineers may be highly complementary with AI technologies.Note In contrast, professions such as those in business, finance, and information and communications technologies\u2014which may also require higher education\u2014have less potential complementarity with AI . However, this does not necessarily mean that these jobs will be in less demand in the future because of AI , as many of them are critical to the economy. Instead, AI could play a transformational role, leading to the creation of new tasks within these jobs, or to new jobs entirely.\n\nDescription for figure Potential artificial intelligence occupational exposure (AIOE) and complementarity in Canada This chart shows a scatter plot with the AI occupational exposure index ranging from 5 to 7 on the horizontal axis and the complementarity index ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 on the vertical axis. There are 490 data points. Each data point represents an occupation as per the 4-digit National Occupation Classification version 2016 and are colour-coded with three different colours. The colours are used to distinguish the occupations according to their minimum educational requirement. Occupations requiring a bachelor's degree or higher are represented by blue, occupations requiring some postsecondary education below bachelor's degree are represented by green, and occupations requiring high school or less education are represented by red. The chart shows the relationship between AI occupational exposure and the extent to which AI can play a complementary role in a given occupation. A higher AI occupational exposure index is associated with greater potential occupational exposure to AI . A higher complementarity index is associated with greater potential complementarity with AI . The median AI occupational exposure index score of 6 and the median complementarity index score of 0.6 are used to group the various occupations into four quadrants. The top-left quadrant contain data points representing occupations which might be relatively less exposed to AI and highly complementary with AI . The majority of occupations in that quadrant require some postsecondary education below bachelor's degree but there are also a few which require high school or less education. Some examples include firefighters, plumbers, and carpenters. The bottom-left quadrant contain data points representing occupations which might also be relatively less exposed to AI but also less complementary with AI . The majority of occupations in that quadrant require high school or less education but there are also a few which require some postsecondary education below bachelor's degree. Some examples include food and beverage servers, labourers in processing, manufacturing and utilities, and welders and related machine operators. The top-right quadrant contain data points representing occupations which might be highly exposed to AI and highly complementary with AI . The majority of occupations in that quadrant require a bachelor's degree or higher education but there are a few which require some postsecondary education below bachelor's degree. Some examples include general practitioners and family physicians, secondary school teachers, and electrical engineers. The bottom-right quadrant contain data points representing occupations which might be highly exposed to AI but less complementary with AI . This quadrant has fewer data points than the other quadrants and the occupations represented by the data points have a mixture of educational requirements. Some examples include data entry clerks, economists, computer network technicians, and computer programmers and interactive media developers. Notes: The AIOE index and potential complementarity are based on Felten, Raj and Seamans (2021) and Pizzinelli et al. (2023). An occupation is considered high-exposure if its AIOE index exceeds the median AIOE across all occupations (6.0) and considered low-exposure otherwise. Similarly, an occupation is considered high-complementarity if its complementarity parameter exceeds the median complementarity across all occupations (0.6) and considered low-complementarity otherwise. Occupations in this chart are based on the 4-digit National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2016 version 1.3 converted from the United States Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2018. Of the 500 NOC occupations, 10 occupations which represented less than 1% of Canadian employment, were excluded due to a lack of Occupational Information Network (O*NET) data for computing the AIOE or complementarity parameter. Source: Occupational Information Network (O*NET) version 28.2.\n\nCertain groups of workers, such as those living in urban areas, women, higher earners and highly educated individuals, are more likely to be employed in jobs that could be highly exposed to AI -related job transformation than other groups. However, they are also more likely to be employed in jobs that could be highly complementary with AI . The AI exposure differences among these groups of workers are largely driven by differences in the mix of occupations they hold. The ability to adapt to technological changes could also vary across individuals.\n\nHighly educated workers are more likely than their less educated counterparts to be in jobs that are highly exposed to job transformation related to artificial intelligence\n\nWhile previous waves of technological transformation primarily affected less educated workers, AI may be more likely to affect more highly educated workers, because these workers are more likely to be in jobs that tend to have cognitive-oriented tasks. Chart 1 shows that 83% to 90% of workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher were in jobs that could be highly exposed to AI -related job transformation. However, more than half of these highly educated workers are in jobs that may be highly complementary with AI . Workers whose highest level of education was an apprenticeship or a trades certificate were the least likely to be in jobs that may be highly exposed to AI -related job transformation (27%). These workers are more likely to be employed in the skilled trades, which may be relatively less exposed to AI -related job transformation.\n\nData table for Chart 1 \ufeff Data table for Chart 1\n\nTable summary\n\nThis table displays the results of Data table for Chart 1. The information is grouped by Highest level of education (appearing as row headers), High exposure, low complementarity, High exposure, high complementarity and Low exposure, calculated using percentage of employees units of measure (appearing as column headers).

While previous waves of technological transformation raised concerns regarding the future of jobs involving routine and manual tasks, a broader segment of the labour force could be affected in an era when AI is increasingly becoming capable of performing non-routine and cognitive tasks typically done by highly skilled workers.\n\nIt is unclear what the net impact of AI will be on jobs in Canada. Experimental estimates of occupational exposure to AI suggest that higher-skilled jobs may be more exposed to AI -related job transformation than lower-skilled jobs. But half of the workers in jobs highly exposed to AI -related transformation may also benefit from it, as long as AI complements the work they do and, when required, they have the necessary skills to leverage it.\n\nThe experimental estimates presented here are meant to be forward-looking based on the current state of AI . They do not account for economic dynamics such as the long-term adaptability of workers, businesses and governments. Moreover, the estimates are based on a subset of current AI applications and capture only a narrow view of AI ( i.e. , generative AI , or AI that responds passively to requests). They exclude more general forms of AI that may be integrated with robotics hardware and have advanced capabilities to think and act autonomously. As AI \u2019s capabilities grow over time, the applicability of the method used in this study could decrease.\n\nThe results from this study can inform labour market policies related to reskilling and career planning, but it should be noted that wide-scale implementation of new technologies can take time. There is also uncertainty surrounding the scale of AI adoption by businesses. Even if AI were to have no net impact on jobs, it may still have implications for other facets of the economy, such as labour productivity and income inequality. How workers, businesses and governments respond and adapt to the potentially evolving developments and implementation of AI remains to be seen.\n\nAuthors\n\nTahsin Mehdi and Marc Frenette are with the Social Analysis and Modelling Division, Analytical Studies and Modelling Branch, Statistics Canada.\n\nReferences\n\nCazzaniga, M., Jaumotte, F., Li, L., Melina, G., Panton, A.

        "text": "Introduction and summary\n\nAs policymakers seek solutions to the current and future impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on workers across the country, workers themselves are using their union bargaining power to negotiate contract provisions that prevent the elimination of jobs, place limits on surveillance and algorithmic management, and enable workers to benefit from productivity boosts offered by AI tools.1 AI and machine learning technologies2 are being used in new ways to automate nonroutine tasks, from writing code and human-sounding text to managing schedules, promising an increase in productivity for some workers. Nevertheless, many workers are understandably nervous that they will be denied the benefits of AI technology. Even as worker productivity increased over the past several decades, those gains went \u201ceverywhere but the paychecks of the bottom 80% of workers,\u201d according to research from the Economic Policy Institute.3 For many workers, AI further threatens to automate parts or all of their jobs or worsen conditions by replacing human decision-making with algorithmic management driven by data harvested via invasive surveillance. Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, predicts \u201cjobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.\u201d4 While policymakers can take advantage of existing worker protections to ensure the use of AI in the workplace benefits workers and consider additional legislative steps, the examples set by unions make clear that policymakers also must complement these protections by strengthening the right to join a union and bargain collectively. Existing law can be applied in a way that protects workers from some of the potential harms of the use of AI in the workplace and hiring. Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), argued in a 2022 memo on electronic hiring and algorithmic management that many of the AI technologies used by employers are already illegal under settled law and urged the board to adopt a framework for protecting employees from surveillance and algorithmic management that interferes with protected activity.5 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued technical assistance in 2021 on compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act6 and algorithmic decision-making tools in hiring and employment as part of a larger algorithmic fairness initiative.7 Across the Biden administration, policymakers can further consider how existing law already regulates the use of AI. Policymakers in Congress and the administration must center workers\u2019 needs in their response to the use and development of AI8 through measures that strengthen workers\u2019 right to come together in unions; ensure AI augments, rather than replaces, workers; prepare the workforce for AI adoption; and help meet the needs of workers who are displaced.9 Lawmakers in Congress are advocating for bills\u2014such as the Stop Spying Bosses Act and the No Robot Bosses Act\u2014that would protect workers from certain threats from AI. These policies should complement bills that strengthen unions, including the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would stiffen penalties for union busting and enhance protections for workers trying to organize their colleagues,10 and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which proposes strengthening organizing rights in the public sector.11\n\nThe Stop Spying Bosses Act and the No Robot Bosses Act The Stop Spying Bosses Act and the No Robot Bosses Act, both introduced in Congress in 2023, address different aspects of employees\u2019 work lives. The Stop Spying Bosses Act12 would outlaw workplace surveillance for monitoring worker organizing or using AI to make behavioral predictions. The bill would also require employers who surveil employees to disclose their use of data collection so workers can be aware of how their data are being collected and used and would establish a Privacy and Technology Division at the U.S. Department of Labor to administer the law. The No Robot Bosses Act13 would prohibit employers from relying exclusively on automated decision-making systems in making employment decisions such as hiring or firing workers. The bill would require testing and oversight of decision-making systems to ensure they do not have a discriminatory impact on workers, and when automated systems are used to help employers make a decision, employers must describe to workers how the system was used and allow workers or job applicants to dispute the system\u2019s output with a human.\n\nA comprehensive policy covering AI in the workplace would combine legislation to regulate novel uses of AI that harm workers, enforcement of existing law against uses of AI that already run afoul of existing employee protections, and stronger rights to organize a union and collectively bargain. Workers in some of the nation\u2019s largest unions have worked tirelessly to negotiate over the uses of new technologies and set an example for how other unions can bargain over AI, but policymakers must open the door for more workers to advocate for themselves over how they can reap the promised benefits of AI.\n\nPolicymakers must open the door for more workers to advocate for themselves over how they can reap the promised benefits of AI.\n\nUnions prevent workers from being replaced\n\nIn some industries where AI\u2019s deployment threatens to replace workers, unions are winning control over the ways employers can use AI technology and how employees should be compensated. In late 2023, casino workers in Las Vegas represented by the Culinary Workers Union achieved a new contract that included a severance package of $2,000 for each year the employee worked if the employee\u2019s role was eliminated due to \u201ctechnology or AI.\u201d14 AI was a contentious issue for workers in two of the largest and most highly publicized strikes in 2023: the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)15 strike of actors and the Writers Guild of America (WGA)16 strike of writers. Both unions negotiated contract resolutions with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) to address the risks AI posed to workers.\n\nSAG-AFTRA, WGA, generative AI, and digital replicas AI directly threatens to reduce or replace work completed by writers and actors alike. Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, can let anyone generate human-sounding scripts, screenplays, and articles based on natural language prompts.17 Generative AI technology also enables digital replicas that allow computer-generated models of actors to be visually inserted into scenes and give performances that actors were never present for.18 Both instances not only threaten to displace work performed by skilled writers and actors, but also use actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 preexisting work to produce the output. This means a writer\u2019s own scripts or an actor\u2019s own performances can be used to create new digital ones\u2014and potentially replace the writer or actor. Both SAG-AFTRA and the WGA reached agreements with the AMPTP that for now alleviate much of the threat that workers\u2019 visual likenesses or written work could be used without compensation or in place of work completed by union members. The SAG-AFTRA agreement includes provisions regarding consent and compensation for use of digital replicas powered by AI.19 The WGA contract places limits on how studios can use AI with human-written material, empowering writers to choose whether to use AI technology in completing their work and enabling writers, rather than the studio alone, to gain from the productivity benefits.20 Because unions democratically advocate for the best interests of their membership, they can also push for contract provisions that matter to workers and their unique circumstances, including workplace-specific concerns regarding the use of AI. In the film industry, credits for workers\u2019 completed work on film projects earn workers money through residuals for reuse of credited work21 and help workers land new jobs and demand and receive higher earnings;22 credits have been the subject of negotiations with unions since the early days of organizing in film.23 As a result, writers run the risk of losing out on the compensation they deserve when their work appears on screen without being credited; AI increases the likelihood of this since it uses publicly available data created by humans, sometimes including copyrighted material, to create its scripts.24 The WGA fought to prevent AI from using material created by WGA workers and ultimately reached a contract with the AMPTP that explicitly includes a provision that AI-written material cannot be considered source material when determining writing credits.25\n\nSAG-AFTRA The contract SAG-AFTRA members ratified with the AMPTP in December 2023 covers television, streaming, and theatrical productions and has extensive language on AI and its use in producing digital replicas that look like real actors. The SAG-AFTRA agreement defines an \u201cEmployment-Based Digital Replica\u201d as a digital performance produced in \u201cconnection with employment on a motion picture\u201d and \u201cwith the performer\u2019s physical participation \u2026 for the purpose of portraying the performer in photography or sound track in which the performer did not actually perform.\u201d26 This means producers making a movie can scan an actor\u2019s performance, then use an AI-generated version of the actor to shoot a scene that actor was not present for, but the contract does not give producers carte blanche to use it however they want without paying the actor. Not only is the worker\u2019s consent required, with a \u201creasonably specific description of the intended use\u201d of the digital copy, but the worker is also entitled to their \u201cpro rata daily rate or the minimum rate, whichever is higher, for the number of production days that Producer determines the performer would have been required to work had the performer instead performed those scene(s) in person,\u201d along with residuals. These provisions mean the technology cannot be used to scan an actor and then use that digital likeness for free however the producers want without consent from and compensation for the actor. The agreement also states that the technology cannot be used to create digital copies of an actor for productions that the actor is not already working on. These are called \u201cindependently created digital replicas,\u201d which create \u201cthe clear impression that the asset is a natural performer whose voice and/or likeness is recognizable as the voice and/or likeness of an identifiable natural performer.\u201d They, too, require consent with a specific description of its use, bargaining, and compensation. Finally, actors negotiated compensation for and asserted control over using generative AI tools to create new performances by using old ones. Producers have to give \u201c[n]otice to Union and an opportunity to bargain in good faith over appropriate consideration, if any, if a Synthetic Performer is used in place of a performer who would have been engaged under this Agreement in a human role\u201d\u2014making it harder for producers to simply use synthetic performers as a way to avoid hiring real actors. They also have to bargain with performers to use AI to generate synthetic performers that share some distinctive facial features with performers. WGA The contract agreed on by the WGA with the AMPTP in September 2023 amends the previous contract between writers and producers with an additional article, Article 72, that deals entirely with AI.27 The article makes clear that writing created by AI or generative AI cannot be \u201cconsidered literary material\u201d under WGA contracts. \u201cLiterary material\u201d is the work product writers produce, so under the contract, the output of AI is not a substitute for the work of actual WGA writers.28 Section C of Article 72 goes further to cover situations where writers are hired to use AI-generated content \u201cas the basis for writing literary material\u201d and ensures that writers are still entitled to the payment, credit, and appropriate rights for their work that they would have enjoyed without AI involvement. The article further states that producers \u201cmay not require, as a condition of employment, that a writer use a GAI [generative AI] program which generates written material that would otherwise be \u2018literary material\u2019 \u2026 if written by a writer\u201d and notes this would prevent, for example, a production company from forcing a writer to use ChatGPT to complete their work. The contract reflects the \u201cuncertain and rapidly developing\u201d legal landscape around AI, and under it, \u201cEach Company agrees to meet with the Guild during the term of this Agreement at least semi-annually at the request of the Guild and subject to appropriate confidentiality agreements to discuss and review information related to the Company\u2019s use and intended use of GAI [generative AI] in motion picture development and production,\u201d giving workers control over how AI use develops in the future. By establishing strong baseline standards to meet the current needs of workers and lay the groundwork for future negotiations, the contract offers an example for how workers can protect their needs in negotiating over AI.\n\nGet the latest\n\non unions and other economic policy issues Email Address (Required) This field is hidden when viewing the form Default Opt Ins This field is hidden when viewing the form C3 General This field is hidden when viewing the form C3 Events This field is hidden when viewing the form C3 Fundraising This field is hidden when viewing the form C3 Cultivation This field is hidden when viewing the form C3 InProgress This field is hidden when viewing the form C3 Digital Contact This field is hidden when viewing the form Variable Opt Ins This field is hidden when viewing the form Redirect url This field is hidden when viewing the form Post url This field is hidden when viewing the form utm_source This field is hidden when viewing the form utm_medium This field is hidden when viewing the form utm_campaign This field is hidden when viewing the form utm_content This field is hidden when viewing the form utm_term This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn1 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn2 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn3 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn4 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn5 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn6 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn7 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn8 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn9 This field is hidden when viewing the form en_txn10 This field is hidden when viewing the form extra_note This field is hidden when viewing the form Opt-in ID CAPTCHA \u0394\n\nUnions bargain over surveillance\n\nAI-powered tools need vast datasets to function. Employers can harvest these data through invasive surveillance of workers, while AI companies may simultaneously gather even more information by processing large amounts of data automatically. If an employer plans to implement an AI-powered tool in its workplace, it may need data unique to its particular warehouses, trucks, or employee laptops. Employers may gather those data by tracking workers via means such as cameras and microphones,29 now powered by AI,30 as well as by monitoring work laptops issued to employees.31 The problem of employee surveillance is nothing new, and unions have been addressing workers\u2019 concerns for decades since surveillance is not only invasive to workers\u2019 privacy and a detriment to job quality but also a core part of the union-busting toolkit.32 The NLRB ruled as early as 1997 that the use of hidden surveillance cameras is a mandatory point on which employers must bargain with unions.33 The Communications Workers of America (CWA) has long negotiated over the use of surveillance in call centers, as many workers feared surveillance could be used against them to initiate disciplinary proceedings. Over the past 30 years, CWA contracts with AT&T, Verizon, Lumen/CenturyLink, and other telecommunications companies have placed limits on how many calls can be monitored, prevented recorded calls from being used to punish employees, and ensured call monitoring is used only to offer feedback for workers and to help train them.34 Today, surveillance continues to harm workers and poses a renewed threat to workers\u2019 ability to come together in unions.35 Efficient AI-enabled processing of bulk data from sensors such as cameras allows more widespread use of surveillance in the workplace, reducing workers\u2019 privacy and harming job quality.36 For example, workers have alleged that Amazon uses its data to calculate abstract performance metrics37 for its warehouse workers that place pressure on employees to overwork themselves and contribute to high rates of injury, stress, and taking unpaid leave,38 creating what one group of researchers called a \u201ccorporate police state.\u201d39 In response to this, Amazon said it has made progress in improving warehouse safety, does not use camera technology in its warehouses to monitor employees, and offers workers multiple methods for reporting safety concerns.40 Workers have also alleged that Amazon monitors employee communications for labor organizing efforts,41 and journalists have detailed Amazon\u2019s surveillance of private Facebook groups used by workers.42 The NLRB ordered the unsuccessful 2021 union vote at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, to be rerun after a regional director of the NRLB found that Amazon \u201ccreated the impression of surveillance\u201d during the mail voting process.43 At the same time, Amazon workers who advocate for unions see unions as a means of addressing workplace surveillance, especially the use of surveillance and automated systems in disciplining employees. Chris Smalls, a former Amazon warehouse employee and the organizer who led a successful unionization vote at Amazon\u2019s Staten Island warehouse in 2022, cited an algorithm-driven employee monitoring system as \u201cone of the big reasons people want to unionize\u201d in 2021, asking \u201cWho wants to be surveilled all day? It\u2019s not prison. It\u2019s work.\u201d44 Joshua Brewer, who helped organize the unsuccessful 2021 union vote at the Amazon, similarly said when asked about one reason why many workers want a union: \u201cThe workers answer to a lot of robotic information systems that deliver their discipline, and they have no say in it.\u201d45 The Guardian reports that surveilling calls remains common at call centers,46 which unions have argued worsens job quality.47 Other industries are experimenting with new forms of surveillance. Hospitals have tracked nurses via a range of technologies including sensor badges that monitor when they wash their hands,48 and Uber has long tracked drivers via their smartphones, using the data to develop algorithms for predicting driver performance, for the purpose of increasing safety.49 The use of surveillance to curtail organizing is such a risk for workers that the NLRB general counsel issued a memo in 2022 urging the NLRB to recognize the threat that surveillance poses to worker organizing.50 The harms posed by surveillance can be mitigated through collective bargaining. In 2022, UPS began to refit its trucks with surveillance cameras that monitor drivers inside their trucks and can continually record and stream data.51 This surveillance increased pressure on workers and interfered with their ability to complete their work in a manageable way, including sorting packages in extreme summer heat. Drivers voiced frustration over the company\u2019s choice to install new surveillance features in their vehicles while it refused to install air conditioning, with one driver alleging \u201csurveillance and discipline are used to make us work faster.\u201d52 The agreement the Teamsters reached with UPS in 2023 after their nationwide strike curtails the use of surveillance in trucks and prevents the potential replacement of workers with automated technology.53 Article 6, Section 6 of the contract covers tracking and surveillance technologies and their use in discipline. The protections are strong and guarantee that human managers are involved at every step of the process, ensuring, \u201cNo employee shall be disciplined based solely upon information received from GPS, telematics, or any successor system that similarly tracks or surveils an employee\u2019s movements unless they engage in dishonesty.\u201d Dishonesty explicitly does not alone consist of a \u201cdriver\u2019s failure to accurately recall what is reflected by the technology,\u201d and UPS \u201cmust confirm by direct observation or other corroborating evidence\u201d behaviors that could result in firing or discipline, preventing tracking technologies from being the sole witness to alleged violations and giving workers a layer of human protection to ensure technology is being used fairly in the disciplinary process. Workers also cannot be warned about infractions based on tracking systems without first having a \u201cverbal counseling session\u201d about that infraction. Surveillance cameras for recording audio and video inside a vehicle cab are banned, and cameras that face outside the vehicle also cannot be used for discipline. These provisions alleviate the burden that surveillance places on workers to overperform in order to avoid being disciplined based on tracking or surveillance technology without human involvement. Article 6, Section 4 establishes a committee between UPS and the Teamsters to review planned technological changes, which are defined under expansive language to include \u201cany meaningful change in equipment or materials which results in a meaningful change in the work, wages, hours, or working conditions of any classification of employees in the bargaining unit or diminishes the number of workers in any classification of employees in the bargaining unit.\u201d Under the agreement, UPS also agreed to notify the union well in advance of plans to implement any change that falls under this definition and to strike agreements with the union about the change being introduced. Furthermore, \u201cIf a technological change creates new work that replaces, enhances or modifies bargaining unit work, bargaining unit employees will perform that new or modified work,\u201d ensuring workplace changes through technological advancement do not cut Teamsters out of the workplace altogether.54\n\nUnions can help when workers have problems with AI management\n\nFor decades, employers have experimented with tools that offload management decisions such as scheduling and performance evaluation to automated systems. More recently, AI has enabled powerful automated management systems that sometimes conflict with workers\u2019 ability to manage themselves or make decisions that workers do not understand or find unfair. Collective bargaining has enabled many workers to negotiate solutions that introduce a human element when needed and preserve the autonomy of individual workers on the job.\n\nRead more\n\nWill AI Benefit or Harm Workers? Article August 24, 2023 Will AI Benefit or Harm Workers? Rose Khattar\n\nAI management AI has increasingly been implemented to assign tasks, schedule workers, and evaluate performance, by offering a way to monitor performance metrics and needs in real time and assign work accordingly.55 Past uses of statistical and computational algorithms, however, have shown that optimizing for narrow productivity targets can harm workers.56 AI management of workers can strip workers\u2019 power to manage the workload themselves. Housekeepers at a hotel that implemented algorithmic management of room-cleaning assignments described how the app-based management solution prevented workers from efficiently managing their own flows, denied them access to necessary information that would have made their jobs easier in deciding how to complete necessary room-cleaning work, and placed a higher workload on workers, all of which can negatively affect worker well-being.57 Academic research so far has found that algorithmic management of platform workers\u2014that is, employees whose work is managed by smart technologies\u2014can increase pressure on workers while making their income, workload, and scheduling less predictable and harder to manage.58 Higher stress and lower worker well-being can themselves negatively affect productivity as well, undermining the original goal of increasing productivity through algorithmic management.59 While the machine learning technologies now becoming mainstream may seem novel, the use of inscrutable algorithms for management, including hiring and firing, is not. Forty-four states and Washington, D.C., had implemented \u201cvalue-added models\u201d by 201560 to evaluate a teacher\u2019s \u201cvalue\u201d to student academic achievement based on statistical analysis of student performance on standardized test scores.61 The models are difficult for nonstatisticians to understand, meaning teachers often could not get clear explanations as to why they failed the algorithm\u2019s test. As the American Statistical Association warned in 2014,62 it was necessary to have \u201chigh-level statistical expertise\u201d to \u201cdevelop the models and interpret their [the models\u2019] results,\u201d which mirrors concerns today that AI is too difficult to explain.63 Despite this, some school districts used these models to make decisions about firing teachers. The District of Columbia Public Schools\u2019 (DCPS) teacher evaluation system, IMPACT, introduced in 2009, resulted in DCPS Chancellor Michelle Rhee firing hundreds of teachers64\u2014and a 2021 DCPS review found IMPACT had \u201cdisparate outcomes between white teachers and teachers of color.\u201d65 The Education Value-Added Assessment System, implemented by the Houston Independent School District starting in 2007, resulted in 221 teachers\u2019 contracts not being renewed by the school district in 2011.66 Seven teachers and their union, the Houston Federation of Teachers, sued the school district, and in 2017, the district agreed to stop using the system\u2019s scores to terminate teachers unless the teachers could test or challenge the score independently.67 Driver deactivation Today, many drivers for ride-sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft have suffered \u201cdeactivations,\u201d made via algorithm, whereby drivers cannot accept new rides using the apps they rely on as a source of income.68 A 2023 survey of 810 drivers for Uber and Lyft in California found that 66 percent of drivers were deactivated at some point by one or both of the companies, and 30 percent of surveyed drivers who were deactivated report being given no explanation by either Uber or Lyft.69 The automated and opaque system powering deactivations results in workers being terminated without an easy-to-understand explanation.70 To combat this, ride-sharing drivers in Seattle organized Drivers Union, an association to help them advocate collectively for protections at the state, local, and industry levels.71 Because American labor unions must organize on a workplace-by-workplace basis, many workers, including app-based platform workers, cannot organize via a traditional NLRB-certified election. Instead, drivers pushed for better policies from their state and local lawmakers.72 In 2021, Seattle implemented a Transport Network Company Driver Deactivation Rights Ordinance,73 which established a panel that allowed drivers to appeal their termination to a government-run workers board with representation from the state-regulated and Drivers Union-operated Driver Resource Center.74 The center was highly effective at helping drivers retain their jobs, with drivers getting their deactivations overturned in 80 percent of cases with Driver Resource Center representation, based on a study of more than 1,400 cases.75 Drivers also advocated for a state law that came into effect across Washington state in 2023,76 guaranteeing minimum wages and paid sick time and workers\u2019 compensation as well as expanding deactivation protections to cover the entire state.77 Drivers Union used this law as a foundation to reach a termination agreement with Uber in 2023,78 under which drivers who lose access for three or more days can file an appeal through the Driver Resource Center and, if no resolution is reached in 30 days, require the company to show just cause for the termination.79\n\nWorkers can act as partners in introducing AI to the workplace\n\nWhile certain uses of AI technology can directly harm workers, it also promises productivity benefits, and unions empower workers to make sure they can share in the benefits. Although many workers are anxious about the introduction of AI into the workplace, some workers are hopeful that the technology can automate many of the repetitive, taxing, or undesirable tasks of their jobs and effectively ensure that work time is better spent.80 A 2023 survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that a majority of manufacturing and financial services workers say AI has had a positive impact on their performance and mental health.81 Nevertheless, there is a risk that productivity benefits accrue only to employers, particularly if they find they need fewer workers to complete tasks and start laying off employees or \u201cdeskilling,\u201d or lowering the skill level needed for existing jobs, in order to pay less.82 The 2023 OECD study also found that more than 40 percent of workers in manufacturing and financial services expect AI to lower their wages within a decade.83 Last year, several major unions and labor organizations won a seat at the table for workers in determining the future of the development and use of AI in their workplaces. In December 2023, the AFL-CIO and Microsoft created a platform for worker input into AI design and a dialogue over public policy to set guardrails for AI deployment.84 The CWA, which represents workers in industries with AI exposure such as game development and AI development itself, has developed bargaining principles for making sure AI works for its workers.85 Using these principles and building on their neutrality agreement with Microsoft, CWA workers at Microsoft video game subsidiary ZeniMax Media reached a tentative agreement86 that commits ZeniMax to provide notice about AI implementation while ensuring that its use of these tools boosts productivity and satisfaction without harming workers.87 Similarly, workers at the Financial Times editorial branch FT Specialist unionized with WGA East and ratified a contract that requires FT Specialist to \u201cdiscuss in advance the introduction of any new technology,\u201d and the union can bargain over the effects of these changes.88\n\nHow unions negotiate over new technology Unions have long negotiated the introduction of new technologies into the workplace in a way that benefits workers. As one recent example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in as many as 35 percent of workers with jobs that can be done remotely taking advantage of technology to work from home all the time instead of in the office in 2023.89 Working from home became preferable for many workers who enjoyed saving time and money on their commute and being able to maintain a better work-life balance, though uncertainty existed over whether employers and workers would prefer working from home in the long term. As a result, many unions that represent workers pushed for greater flexibility in their contracts. Workers at a range of companies won reductions in the number of days per week or month workers needed to report in person to the office, new ways for workers to request time to work from home, and increased availability of fully remote options. Nearly 700 technology workers at The New York Times went on strike in October 2023 over the publication\u2019s return-to-work policy.90 At the federal Government Accountability Office, 2,500 unionized workers won an agreement for a flexible remote-work policy in September 2023,91 in contrast to many other federal workers being brought back into the office, as did a union representing 7,500 Environmental Protection Agency employees in 2021.92 Unionized university staff at schools including Harvard93 and within the City University of New York system94 solidified and extended remote-work policies as well. The CWA reached agreements in 2022 with AT&T95 and Verizon96 that established terms for employees working from home, including stipends for remote-work costs, pay protection during system outages, and limits on the use of webcams for surveillance. A similar process is taking place where AI technologies are being introduced, although uncertainty over its exact uses remains. The CWA and ZeniMax reached a tentative agreement over using AI.97 ZeniMax agreed to limit itself to \u201cuses of AI that augment human ingenuity and capacities, to ensure that these tools enhance worker productivity, growth, and satisfaction without causing workers harm.\u201d While a final contract has not yet been reached, the language was developed as part of a \u201cProactive Bargaining\u201d strategy by the CWA to deal with the effects of AI on its members rather than allow employers to take the first step and force unions on the back foot.98 Dylan Burton, a QA tester at ZeniMax, hailed the agreement: \u201cThis agreement empowers us to shape the ways we may choose to use AI in our work and also gives us the means to address those impacts before their potential implementation.\u201d99\n\nConclusion",

Jensen Huang doesn\u2019t forecast a future where AI really replaces anyone, after all.\n\n\"As we speak, AI has no possibility of doing what we do,\" he said at Nvidia's October AI Summit, reported Business Insider. Throwing out some numbers, Huang claimed AI can do 20% to 50% of one\u2019s job 1,000 times better\u2014depending on your role.\n\nBut Huang isn\u2019t shifting in his seat, or his fancy leather jacket. Responding to questions regarding whether AI could take his gig, he said \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d He differs from some other CEOs in this arena, as 49% of executives surveyed by edX believed \u201cmost\u201d or all of their jobs should be replaced by AI.\n\nEither way, though, AI is not likely to fully invade, from Huang\u2019s point of view. \u201cIn no job can they do all of it,\u201d he said of the innovation. His view of the latest wave of tech is not all that different from the pablum many of us hear daily. It goes along the lines of: AI won\u2019t replace your job, but someone who knows AI will. Everyone from a Harvard Business professor to Netflix's CEO has said it\u2014seemingly all getting the same handout.\n\nNow Huang is joining in. The real threat is that \"the person who uses AI to automate that 20% is going to take your job,\" he said. He added that he imagines a future where AI is integrated into a human\u2019s role, operating as \u201cassistants\u201d that help us become more productive.\n\nIndeed, it simply doesn\u2019t make sense for bots to replace humans in many cases. Only 23% of workers' compensation as \u201c\u2018exposed\u2019 to AI computer vision\u201d would be cost-effectively replaced by AI systems, according to researchers from MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. In other words, it\u2019s not even cheaper for AI to invade.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that while there is a lot of potential for AI to replace tasks, it\u2019s not going to happen immediately,\u201d Neil Thompson, one of the authors of said paper, told CNN, saying that amid all the headlines about robots taking jobs, \u201cit\u2019s really important to think about the economics of actually implementing these systems.\u201d\n\nRight now, though, AI is a little underbaked if the goal is to push out workers, much less be of any real help to them. Some innovations or chatbot systems held up by AI are plagued by hallucinations and bugs.\n\n\"All of our AI systems today are thinking fast, we haven't brought reasoning into AI,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2024. \"Today our systems hallucinate, tomorrow if we're going to use them broadly, they have to be right,\u201d he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "text": "If AI is so good, why are there still so many jobs for translators?\n\ntoggle caption Vaselena/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, a drumbeat of news headlines played into public anxieties about the safety of human jobs when Duolingo, a language learning app, became a prominent example of a company cutting workers and replacing them with artificial intelligence.\n\nThe most eye-catching job cuts were those for translators, who worked on some of the company\u2019s less popular language education courses. Translators and interpreters are often near the top of media listicles as the jobs most likely to be killed by AI. When the stories about Duolingo\u2019s job cuts circulated, they seemed to confirm that the inevitable AI jobs apocalypse had arrived.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a recent conversation with Planet Money, the CEO of Duolingo, Luis von Ahn, downplayed the meaning of the cuts. It wasn't full-time employees. It was only 10% of their contractors. His company\u2019s recent embrace of generative AI only played one part in the decision, and so on. More interesting, considering Duolingo\u2019s official partnership with OpenAI, was von Ahn\u2019s reaction to the company\u2019s recent demonstration of its newest version of ChatGPT, GPT-4o.\n\nIn its live-streamed demonstration event announcing the launch of GPT-4o last month, OpenAI showcased how good its popular chatbot is at translating languages between people in real time. It showed two OpenAI employees, one speaking Italian, the other English, with a ChatGPT app on a smartphone audibly translating a conversation between them. The demo was short, with the employees asking and answering a single question: \u201cIf whales could talk, what would they tell us?\u201d ChatGPT \u2014 not surprisingly, given this was a public marketing event \u2014 seemed to do a good job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny that was the demo,\u201d von Ahn says. He says Google Translate could have done a similar demonstration like 8 years ago. The reality, he says, is that computer translation between the world\u2019s major languages has already been \u201creally good\u201d for quite a while.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIndeed, AI has been supercharging the abilities of machines to translate foreign languages for close to a decade or more \u2014 which is why it\u2019s an interesting case study of the potential effects AI will have on the job market. Contrary to some of the doomsayers, the great AI massacre of translator jobs has not arrived, including even at Duolingo. It\u2019s proving hard to fully automate away translation jobs. But why isn\u2019t AI killing these jobs? And, even if it isn\u2019t, how is it reshaping them?\n\n\n\nAI Hype\n\nAs far back as 2006, when Google launched Google Translate, the translation industry has been \u201cspeculating about the potential for AI to replace human translators,\u201d says Bridget Hylak, a representative from the American Translators Association, the largest professional organization for translators and interpreters in the United States. \u201cSince the advent of neural machine translation (NMT) around 2016, which marked a significant improvement over traditional machine translation like Google Translate, we [translators and interpreters] have been integrating AI into our workflows.\u201d\n\nSo, yeah, translators have been grappling with AI for a while. Yet, despite the fact that anyone with a smartphone has long been able to use this machine translation technology for free or at a relatively low cost \u2014 there are still a ton of jobs for human translators and interpreters out there.\n\nIn fact, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of jobs for human translators and interpreters grew by 49.4% between 2008 and 2018, thanks largely to globalization. After 2018, BLS changed how they collect and measure occupational data, which makes it less reliable for measuring job growth over the last few years.\n\nHowever, data from the Census Bureau, which began tracking growth in this occupation in 2020, shows the number of people employed as interpreters and translators grew 11 percent between 2020 and 2023. (Thanks to Sofia Shchukina, our new Planet Money fellow, for helping us sift through and crunch all the numbers!)\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe reality is that, despite advances in AI, jobs for human interpreters and translators are not cratering. In fact, the data suggests they\u2019re growing.\n\nTons of businesses and governments are currently hiring translators and interpreters. Honda, for example, is currently hiring a Japanese interpreter/translator for its factories in South Carolina. Starplus Energy, a manufacturer of batteries for electric vehicles, seeks multiple Korean interpreters/translators for their plant in Kokomo, Indiana. The City of San Francisco seeks a \u201cBilingual (English-Spanish) Translator/Proofreader and Phone Operator.\u201d Languars Inc wants a \u201cFrench Medical Interpreter.\u201d\n\nIn fact, BLS projects the number of jobs for interpreters and translators will grow by about 4% over the next decade. While that would represent a slowdown from the tremendous job growth the industry saw over the last couple decades, it is still actually slightly faster than the average growth BLS projects for all existing occupations in the US economy.\n\nSo, if AI has gotten so good, and so good at translation in particular, why are there still so many jobs for translators and interpreters?\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that good,\u201d says Daron Acemoglu, a superstar economist at MIT who studies AI. \u201cI think how good AI has become is often exaggerated.\u201d\n\nAcemoglu has a new academic paper out that sort of throws a wet blanket over the fiery excitement for AI. Sure, he says, AI can do some amazing things. \u201cBut there is pretty much nothing that humans do as meaningful occupation that generative AI can now do. So in almost everything it can at best help humans, and at worst, not even do that.\u201d\n\nAcemoglu says he believes translation is \u201cone of the best test cases\u201d for AI\u2019s capability to take over human jobs \u201cbecause, I think if it can do anything, it\u2019s translation.\u201d But, he says, even in this realm, the technology is just \u201cnot that reliable.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhy AI Didn\u2019t Kill The Translation Star (At Least Not Yet)\n\nFor a more bullish take on AI, back to Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn. Von Ahn, like many other technologists, sees AI ushering in a dramatically different world. It, for example, is making his company\u2019s mission of teaching people foreign languages with an app more effective by enabling users to have rich, improvised conversations with an interactive chatbot.\n\nHowever, even von Ahn acknowledges that the technology is still limited. That\u2019s why, despite recent headlines suggesting otherwise, his company still employs translators. \u201cIt\u2019s still the case that computers make mistakes,\u201d von Ahn says. \u201cI don\u2019t think you wanna fully rely on a computer if you're a translator for the army and you're talking to an enemy combatant or something like that.\u201d\n\nDuolingo, von Ahn says, still uses human translators to double-check that machine-generated translations don\u2019t make mistakes in the company\u2019s learning content. But, he says, translators at his company mostly work on more high-value aspects of the business, where the extra cost of employing a human is really worth it. \u201cIf it\u2019s things like the user interface of Duolingo, where a button on the app says \u2018quit\u2019 or \u2018purchase now\u2019 or whatever, that translation is all done with humans. We spend a lot of effort on that because each one of those features is highly valuable. We just cannot have a mistake.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about mistakes, von Ahn says. The company also uses human translators to ensure consistency in the company\u2019s style and tone throughout their app. Turns out, AI can\u2019t consistently master \u201cthe same playful voice\u201d Duolingo wants to communicate to users. So, for that, von Ahn says, \u201cwe still employ humans.\u201d\n\nDaniel Sebesta, another representative from the American Translators Association, suggests this is a common reason why companies and governments still employ human translators. \u201cAI still struggles with complex linguistic tasks that require creativity, cultural sensitivity, and the ability to understand subtle nuances in meaning, especially in low-resource languages (i.e., languages that don\u2019t have millions upon millions of high-quality translated words that can be used to train AI),\u201d Sebesta says. \u201cCompanies continue to hire human translators and interpreters because they understand that AI cannot replace the expertise and judgment that these professionals bring to the table. This is particularly true for high-stakes projects in fields like legal, medical, but also literary translation, where accuracy and cultural appropriateness are paramount.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn realms where mistakes could mean lawsuits, embarrassment, injuries, or even deaths, it makes a lot of sense why so many companies, non-profits, and government agencies still want humans overseeing and editing AI-generated translation and interpretation. There\u2019s also considerable demand for human translators and interpreters due to regulations. \u201cIn the United States, the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars discrimination based on language, so some entities \u2014 like courts and schools \u2014 are simply mandated to provide language services,\u201d Hylak says.\n\n\"Despite the widespread use of translation software, having a human expert in the loop is still necessary to ensure reliable and accurate translations,\u201d says Javier Colato, an economist at BLS. \u201cHuman translators will also be needed to handle more complex translations, such as technical documents and literary works. Therefore, considering the strong underlying demand for translations and continued need for human translators, some employment growth is still likely for the occupation.\"\n\nThe Wages Of Cyborg Translators\n\nEveryone we spoke to stressed that these days, human translators and interpreters use AI as a tool to become much more productive. \u201cWe see a future \u2014 for many, in fact, a present \u2014 where AI-powered tools and human translators/interpreters collaborate, with AI handling more routine tasks and humans focusing their cognitive effort on the more creative and nuanced aspects of conveying meaning,\u201d says Sebesta.\n\nVon Ahn says he believes this human-machine collaboration in translation is one reason why demand for translation services is so strong. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing today, for translation in particular, is this combo, this hybrid between humans and computers,\u201d von Ahn says. That has made translation a lot faster and cheaper, and, as a result, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more demand.\u201d\n\nSo, great, more demand for translation services as they get cheaper. And AI is proving, at least so far, incapable of doing much of this work without an important role for humans. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the humans doing these jobs are thriving in this changing translation economy. AI automation of much of their work may, in fact, be devaluing their skills, since, thanks to the assistance of machines, more people can do more translation better and faster.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAcemoglu\u2019s research suggests that the effect of automation on wages is, well, complicated and not universal. Sometimes automation can enrich workers. Think doctors who no longer have to spend as much time on paperwork thanks to computers. Instead, they can focus more on their bread and butter skills of treating patients. These skills are scarce, in demand, and therefore very valuable, and focusing more on them, doctors can be more productive and get even richer.\n\nBut other times automation can hurt an occupation\u2019s wages by devaluing its core skills. Even if automation doesn\u2019t kill the job, maybe what was a high-skilled job in the marketplace becomes a more lower-skill job as machines enable a whole lot more people to do it.\n\nAnd, sure, these now-low-skill workers may be way more productive than they were before technological advances. But, Acemoglu stresses, this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll necessarily share in the fruits of that productivity. Factory owners \u2014 or the owners of AI algorithms \u2014 may get all the money. Historically, Acemoglu\u2019s research suggests, workers have had to turn to strikes, unionization efforts, or elections of pro-labor politicians to pass policies like minimum wage laws to share in the new riches created by machines and increase their standard of living.\n\nData from BLS \u2014 which is usually the best data source for stuff like this, but again, might not be well-suited to track changes over the last few years \u2014 suggest that, if anything, the wages of the typical translator and interpreter are actually growing. As of 2023, the typical interpreter and translator made $27.45 per hour, or about $57,090 per year, which is slightly higher than the typical pay for all American workers (about $48,000 per year).\n\nWhen it comes to incomes, Sebesta foresees a growing disparity between translators who master AI and those who don\u2019t. \u201cThe incomes of the former group will rise and the practitioners will feel empowered,\u201d Sebesta says. \u201cThe other group will likely feel left behind and exploited and will miss out on the opportunities.\u201d It\u2019s why, he says, he sees his organization, the American Translators Association, as having an important mission in helping translators adapt to technological change and thrive in the age of AI.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAcemoglu, the MIT economist, glancing at the economics of the translation business, believes that the incomes of most translators and interpreters will likely take a hit as technological change sweeps the industry. For him, it boils down to the laws of supply and demand. If AI enables a flood of translation supply, that likely means the price of translation goes down. Translation services get cheaper. Good for consumers. Probably bad for the incomes of many translators. Although, he says, maybe more elite workers in the profession \u2014 like translators of books or high-level interpreters working in diplomacy \u2014 will be exempt from this downward pressure on their wages.\n\nBut, even if this scenario manifests itself, it would not mean an existential threat for the jobs of most human translators and interpreters anytime soon.",

This anticipated move could completely transform how these companies hire new employees and how they manage and deliver the technology employees use.\n\nMajor financial services organizations such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are testing AI tools that could one day largely replace junior analysts and the hours of time they put into compiling and interpreting reports and crunching numbers and statistics \u2014 work that generative AI tools can do in a matter of seconds, according to a New York Times report.\n\nLarge banking firms are quietly testing AI tools under code names such as as Socrates that could one day make the need to hire thousands of college graduates at these firms obsolete, according to the report.",

        "text": "The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence has promised to create new jobs and make workers more productive, but these changes have come with a cost. A 2023 ResumeBuilder survey found that 37 percent of companies using AI replaced workers with the technology and 44 percent anticipated AI-induced layoffs in 2024.\n\nWill Artificial Intelligence (AI) Replace Jobs? AI is replacing and will continue to replace some jobs. Workers in industries ranging from healthcare to agriculture and industrial sectors can all expect to see disruptions in hiring due to AI. But demand for workers in other sectors is also expected to rise, thanks to AI.\n\nSome experts and industry insiders, however, aren\u2019t too worried about the rise of AI and remain unimpressed with the technology. While discussing AI models with the BBC, Nick Clegg, Meta\u2019s president of global affairs, went so far as to say, \u201cIn many ways, they\u2019re quite stupid.\u201d Even OpenAI founder Sam Altman believes current AI tools are \u201cwildly overhyped.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t that the machines aren\u2019t rising. It\u2019s that they\u2019re rising much more slowly than some of the more breathless media coverage might have you believe \u2014 which is great news for most of those who think AI-powered technology will soon steal their jobs.\n\n\u201cMost of\u201d being the operative words.\n\n10 Jobs AI Will Replace\n\nThe consensus among many experts is that a number of professions will be totally automated in the next five to 10 years. Below are a few roles that are at risk of being taken over by AI in the near future.\n\nJobs AI Will Replace Customer service representative\n\nCar and truck driver\n\nComputer programmer\n\nResearch analyst\n\nParalegal\n\nFactory or warehouse worker\n\nFinancial trader\n\nTravel advisor\n\nContent writer (in some cases)\n\nGraphic designer\n\nCustomer Service Representative\n\nThe customer service role is becoming more automated, as tools like chatbots and virtual assistants handle a broader range of customer inquiries and requests. Advancements like self-checkouts also make human workers less relevant in settings like grocery stores, reducing the number of jobs within the customer service industry.\n\nCar and Truck Driver\n\nImprovements in autonomous vehicles reduce the need for human drivers, impacting those in both the taxi and rideshare industries. In fact, Uber has partnered with self-driving car companies like Waymo and Aurora to give its riders more options, potentially setting up a conflict with its human drivers.\n\nComputer Programmer\n\nGenerative AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini have raised questions about whether AI will replace writing-heavy jobs. While human language requires much more creativity and nuance, programming consists of more structured, straightforward language. ChatGPT can already be used to write code, so entry-level programming jobs may soon succumb to automation.\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nResearch-centric positions like market research analyst and financial analyst can be performed, at least to a degree, by AI. Machine learning has the ability to process large volumes of data, detect patterns and organize its findings into convenient visuals. This makes AI ideal for quickly delivering industry insights to teams without the need for human intervention.\n\nParalegal\n\nMany administrative tasks completed by paralegals are within the range of AI\u2019s capabilities. With its ability to process massive amounts of complex data, AI can write legal reports, gather facts for a case, sort through documents and conduct legal research. This promises greater efficiency for legal firms, perhaps one day rendering the paralegal role obsolete.\n\nFactory or Warehouse Worker\n\nAI powers lots of machines in factories, performing many actions with greater speed and consistency than humans. Additionally, machine vision enables AI-powered machines in warehouses to retrieve goods and navigate their surroundings, making logistics providers less dependent on human warehouse workers.\n\nFinancial Trader\n\nFinancial traders are in charge of analyzing markets and informing investors\u2019 decisions, but AI can work through this process much faster. AI trading technologies can also predict market trends while remaining more accurate than human workers. These two factors combined with the fact that AI lowers hiring costs mean financial trader roles could disappear soon.\n\nTravel Advisor\n\nTravelers no longer need to rely on travel agents for personalized recommendations and travel tips. Travel platforms can leverage AI to power customer searches and make suggestions based on previous searches. Experiences like virtual tours and online informational videos also allow travelers to gather the information they want without turning to a travel agency.\n\nContent Writer (In Some Cases)\n\nAI content generators can already help brainstorm writing ideas and assist with repetitive content creation. Basic content marketing tasks like writing formulaic emails and short social media posts are no trouble for artificial intelligence. In some cases, AI can even produce a first draft for longer-form content, taking over many duties for human content marketers.\n\nGraphic Designer\n\nGraphic designers are in direct competition with AI-generated art, especially since the ability to produce this kind of art is available to the public. Tools like Lensa and DALL-E make it easy to create professional images without artistic expertise. As a result, businesses and individuals may depend less on graphic design services to produce eye-catching visuals moving forward.\n\n9 Jobs AI Won\u2019t Replace\n\nWe can take comfort in the fact that some jobs are less likely to be replaced by AI. The jobs that AI won\u2019t be able to replicate range from creative fields to empathic jobs, as well as complex strategic jobs.\n\nJobs AI Won't Replace Teacher\n\nNurse\n\nSocial Worker\n\nTherapist\n\nHandyperson\n\nLawyer\n\nHR Specialist\n\nWriter\n\nArtist\n\nTeacher\n\nAI-powered tools have made gains in the classroom, guiding small-group interactions and helping children grow their socio-emotional skills. But AI can\u2019t build the trust and intimacy that human teachers are able to have with their students. Human teachers may also be more equipped to resolve arguments, reach out to students\u2019 parents and handle other complex social interactions.\n\nNurse\n\nSimple healthcare tasks like transporting medical supplies and retrieving patient data may fall to artificial intelligence. It\u2019s the face-to-face interactions where a human touch is essential. Providing bedside care, having hard conversations with families and assuaging the fears of patients are all situations where nurses and other health workers may be preferred over AI.\n\nSocial Worker\n\nSocial workers probably won\u2019t be replaced by AI anytime soon. The work they engage in \u2014 often with people from underserved or at-risk populations \u2014 requires a human touch and judgment. Understanding people\u2019s unique circumstances and helping them navigate stressful situations are areas humans may be better prepared for than artificial intelligence.\n\nTherapist\n\nTherapists perform a great deal of emotional labor, listening to people\u2019s problems and guiding them as they work through their feelings, thoughts and emotional responses. AI doesn\u2019t have the ability to grasp this aspect of humans to such a degree. And with a mental health crisis on the rise, human-led therapy is more crucial than ever to aid those who feel stuck or isolated.\n\nHandyperson\n\nPeople who work in the trades, like plumbers and electricians, often have to perform a range of manual labor and handle more in-depth human interactions \u2014 two things AI doesn\u2019t excel at. Plumbers, for example, have to demonstrate excellent eye-hand coordination to handle different appliances while displaying the soft skills needed to work with residents to resolve issues.\n\nLawyer\n\nAlthough AI has become a major part of the legal industry, it\u2019s unlikely to replace lawyers any time soon. Lawyers are expected to possess a strong grasp of morals and ethics, relying on this knowledge to inform their legal advice. AI giving legal advice raises many ethical questions since AI doesn\u2019t have the same sense of \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019 as humans.\n\nHR Specialist\n\nHR specialists oversee areas like recruiting, interviewing and onboarding \u2014 all processes that require high levels of personalized, human interactions. AI might be useful for screening resumes, but it may not be able to offer the kind of sensitivity and thoughtfulness required to navigate situations like layoffs, private questions about benefits and employee complaints.\n\nWriter\n\nDespite enjoying a boom in popularity, AI writing tools struggle to match the quality and creativity of talented human writers. Copywriters, UX writers and technical writers alike routinely exercise critical thinking in their work, such as making decisions based on audience preferences and needs. While AI tools can assist with generating ideas, the quirks of writing and human language are much harder to master.\n\nArtist\n\nAI art generators are skilled at producing high-quality pieces, but these pieces are only based on artworks and styles that already exist. Human artists are the ones who develop new styles and ideas that drive innovation within the artistic landscape. The livelihoods of artists will still be impacted by AI, but artistic originality resides with humans.\n\nBenefits of AI in the Workplace\n\nDespite fears of job loss due to automation, AI does offer major advantages to companies and workers who embrace the technology.\n\nMore Focused and Engaging Tasks\n\nAmong AI\u2019s biggest boons, many experts believe, is its ability to save humans from having to perform tedious repetitive tasks that are part of their overall duties so they\u2019re free to focus on more complex and rewarding projects \u2014 or just take some much-needed time off.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a concern that technology is displacing this current body of workers or tasks, and that\u2019s true,\u201d Sean Chou, co-founder of AI startup Catalytic, said. \u201cBut what always happens is that work, and that output, gets redirected to things that are much more productive.\u201d\n\nMore Efficient and Shorter Workdays\n\nSome think increased productivity and efficiency might even shorten the work week. Which seems good in theory but comes with its own set of issues. How will pay and benefits be affected? And who reaps the bulk of monetary rewards? Those remain unanswered questions.\n\n\u201cUp to this point, technology has created more work because it\u2019s another thing you have to deal with,\u201d said Justin Adams, former CEO at Digitize.AI and vice president at its parent company Waystar. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s an inflection point where certain AI will get to a place where that actually flips.\u201d\n\nMore Informed Decision-Making\n\nBecause AI and machine learning can gather and process large volumes of data, human workers can more quickly access data-based insights and understand the meaning behind trends and patterns. This takes the guesswork out of important decisions, ensuring employees rely on data-driven discoveries to help them make accurate decisions for their teams and businesses.\n\nIncreased Innovation and Problem-Solving\n\nWith AI taking care of redundant and mundane tasks, humans can dedicate their energy to addressing more complicated business challenges. AI-based tools like ChatGPT can also take on a collaborative role, allowing humans to bounce ideas off of them. As a result, AI can expand people\u2019s capacity to solve problems and serve as collaborators that spur innovative approaches to lingering business issues.\n\nMore Personalized Customer Interactions\n\nEmployees can use AI technologies to gather data on users\u2019 online behavior and save information on customer preferences. These abilities enable teams to tailor products and services to customers\u2019 needs and cultivate more personalized, higher-quality customer interactions. By enhancing the customer experience, employees can help improve their company\u2019s reputation and profitability.\n\nHow AI Will Create Jobs\n\nThe development of AI itself requires many humans to train and refine AI algorithms. This leads to the creation of roles that haven\u2019t existed until now. Machine learning engineers must design and oversee AI systems while AI ethics specialists ensure AI is deployed responsibly.\n\nChou confirms the necessity for human workers. \u201cThe number of people that are necessary to deliver better and better technology grows massively,\u201d Chou said. \u201cWhen you look at AI, there\u2019s this nonstop need for training, for data, for maintenance, for taking care of all the exceptions that are happening. How do we monitor AI? How do we train it? How do we make sure that AI\u2019s not running amok? Those are all going to become new jobs.\u201d\n\nRather than completely destroying jobs, AI is shifting jobs and changing the type of work that professionals do. It\u2019s the kind of impact that the internet had upon its introduction. Chris Nicholson, CEO of machine learning company Skymind.AI, shares a similar view rooted in even more distant history.\n\n\u201cEverybody uses this analogy, but when the Industrial Revolution came, a certain kind of job disappeared,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cBut many jobs, and many [new] jobs, were created. So when you think about, say, England before and after the Industrial Revolution, it wasn\u2019t a poorer place where there was less work. There was a lot more work, but it was a different kind of work.\u201d\n\nHow to Prepare for AI in the Workplace\n\nAmazon announced that it would retrain 300,000 employees to the tune of $1.2 billion. Participation is voluntary in a program the company calls \u201cUpskilling 2025,\u201d which is designed to teach employees skills they can apply to work in technical roles inside or outside of Amazon. More cynical observers might chalk that up to an expensive public relations campaign in light of less-than-flattering reports about how the company allegedly treats its workers.\n\nSkills to Cultivate in the Age of AI Basic mathematics\n\nStrong verbal and written communication\n\nCreativity\n\nPeople management\n\nEmotional intelligence\n\nCritical thinking and problem-solving\n\nBesides that, retraining warehouse workers to be, say, engineers is completely unrealistic. Which isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s no value in additional education.\n\n\u201cI think that we should be trying to get people to understand a little bit about a lot of things so the jump is not very large and the opportunities come,\u201d said Dan Platt, senior principal of market innovation at AI company Narrative Science. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to train everybody to write in Python, but if you have people that are trained to understand the basics of engineering, or how things work, their chances [of not being displaced] are a lot higher.\u201d\n\nFor Nicholson, surviving and thriving in an increasingly AI-powered world requires a multi-pronged approach. First and foremost, he advises, \u201cAvoid bullshit jobs. If you\u2019re bored in your job, it\u2019s probably a bullshit job and the machines will probably eat it.\u201d\n\nBasic skills can be a crucial asset as well. For example, having solid verbal and written communication like listening, reading emotions, asking questions, writing clearly and structuring cogent arguments devoid of ambiguity.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea, Nicholson says, to cultivate a decent understanding of statistical concepts, calculus and algebraic linear regression in order to comprehend the \u201coutput of AI algorithms.\u201d Arming oneself with that sort of foundational knowledge is key to \u201cbeing able to adapt.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like to compare AI to electricity,\u201d Chou said. \u201cAnd I actually agree with that analogy. But electricity took one or two generations to go from idea to widespread adoption, whereas today we\u2019re seeing the impact of technology occur much faster.\u201d\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat jobs will AI replace? AI will replace both blue-collar and white-collar jobs that involve more straightforward and repetitive tasks. These jobs include drivers, factory workers, administrative assistants, paralegals and some copywriters.\n\nWhat jobs are safe from AI? Jobs that involve more complex tasks and human interaction are mostly safe from AI. This includes teachers, nurses, therapists and people in the trades.\n\nWhat jobs will AI create? Human workers are required to train and develop AI systems. Machine learning engineer, AI ethics specialist and AI and cybersecurity researcher are a few examples of jobs AI will create.\n\nHow many jobs will AI replace? AI could replace as many as 85 million jobs worldwide by 2025, according to a 2020 World Economic Forum report.\n\nWill AI replace jobs? Not all jobs will be replaced by AI, but many roles like customer service representative, truck driver and computer programmer could be automated. In addition, AI could lead to new jobs like machine learning engineer and prompt engineer.",

        "text": "Yes, AI might be coming for your banking job, but it will likely open as many doors as it closes, writes Anna Becker, of Endotech. Tierney - stock.adobe.com\n\nThere's good news and bad news regarding artificial intelligence for finance professionals. The bad news is that AI is indeed coming for your job \u2014 but the good news is that AI will also give you many more opportunities than you have now. In similar previous tech revolutions, initial fears over job losses indeed came to pass \u2014 but ultimately those new technologies generated new jobs, based on new needs that the technology itself inspired. It's happened too many times to count \u2014 from the printing press to the computer revolution \u2014 and there's no reason to think that AI will be any different.\n\nThere's a pervasive fear among many \u2014 including top-level executives in the financial sector \u2014 that AI will sooner or later \u2014 more likely sooner \u2014 send them to the unemployment line. As advanced generative AI \u2014 the kind of AI that can duplicate human thought patterns \u2014 gets better, more of it will be used to replace high-cost humans in roles such as investment advisor, account manager, trader, bank executive and more.\n\nAnd chances are that AI will do at least as good, if not a better job than many of those it is replacing, and for a lot less money. Investment advisors are, after all, human and prone to the mistakes, misunderstandings and missteps that all humans are, regardless of their level of experience and expertise. Those mistakes can cost institutions and advisors a lot of money. AI-driven investment systems don't get tired, and take into account all data needed to provide the best advice possible.\n\nIn addition, AI-powered advisory services could reduce the cost of individualized planning \u2014 currently offered by many institutions only to the most well-heeled \u2014 opening up opportunities for that kind of advice to more people. The same is likely for many other financial roles; as generative AI improves, it will be able to make decisions on its own. The role for humans will likely become more supervisory, reviewing decisions made by the machines to ensure that they make sense \u2014 but the number of supervisors needed will, obviously, be far less than the number of employees that will be replaced.\n\nBut while AI gobbles up the lower-level jobs that currently exist, it will likely create many more jobs \u2014 just like other, previous technological revolutions that replaced menial and repetitive jobs with positions that required higher levels of financial, technical and empathetic skills. A telling parallel from the past is that while the \"horseless carriage\" eliminated thousands of jobs \u2014 manufacturers of wooden carts used by horses, stable workers, sanitation workers responsible for cleaning up horse manure \u2014 it created tens of thousands of new jobs, from car repair staff to fuel station managers and employees to traffic managers to manufacturers of road signs, and many more. Those jobs paid significantly more than the salaries stable hands and sanitation workers received. And those new jobs weren't created far off in the future; there was an immediate need for workers in those new roles.\n\nPayments How can banks and fintechs get employees' buy-in on generative AI? To protect their own talent pipeline, financial companies need to make sure that they're not only protecting the entry-level roles that AI threatens to take over, but getting the enthusiastic buy-in of the people most likely to be affected, according to experts from Fiserv, Segpay and Featurespace. April 11\n\nWhat opportunities, then, will be available for finance industry professionals whose jobs are replaced by AI? Experts say that new roles for financial executives could include \"debiasers\" \u2014 helping individuals choose between investment plans presented by AI systems based on their needs, life situation and other factors; LLM developers, who work with AI chat systems to utilize the most relevant training data; AI ethicists, who will ensure that AI results comply with legal and ethical requirements; and content creators, who will help clients pose their queries in the most efficient and usable manner.\n\nBut those are just the jobs that experts can foresee, based on current social and economic conditions. Many of the new resulting jobs, industries and businesses were unforeseen when technologies came on-line, and the needs only became obvious when the technology spread. For example, the invention of the printing press may have put scribes out of business, but the mass printing of books gave rise to the invention of the bookstore \u2014 an institution that would have been unthinkable in the pre-printing press era, when the availability of texts was extremely limited. This is the case today. If AI, for example, makes individualized financial advice available to everyone, investment institutions will need support personnel to work with all these new customers, helping them to decide on the best investment strategy for their needs.\n\nAnecdotal evidence from across the finance industry confirms this trend. I have seen that for years AI professionals mainly worked one-on-one with investment firms to design an AI-based strategy based on a single financial or social factor, with the system analyzing data relating to that factor. But with time, more robust AI-driven platforms that take into account all these factors have emerged, allowing financial firms to work efficiently with higher numbers of clients.\n\nThat has meant growth in mid-level and senior staff at financial AI companies, as well as for those investment firms who use such tools. As the investment firms are able to handle many more clients with diverse needs, they need to hire more consultants and managers to help clients navigate AI systems. Those AI systems will faithfully and efficiently continue to carry out the roles of the lower level workers they replaced \u2014 but many of those workers have moved on to more sophisticated (and probably higher paying) jobs, with many using AI to quickly and automatically do what they used to do in their previous roles, while adding to the value of those activities in their new, AI-driven roles.\n\nThe future, then, is far from bleak. Financial professionals of tomorrow \u2014 and that tomorrow will be here far faster than most of us anticipate \u2014 will work with sophisticated and advanced AI tools in new roles, the needs for which will very quickly make themselves known. Those roles will require workers to utilize higher skill sets \u2014 better understanding of the market, more creativity, greater empathy with clients, without the repetitiveness, tediousness and manual labor in many of the roles currently available in the industry. Financial industry workers don't need to be concerned about losing their jobs to AI \u2014 they need to be concerned over which of the many opportunities they will want to seek out when the time comes.",

The technology is expected to significantly impact the global economy by transforming the labor market and changing the nature of work.\n\nOrganizations use AI in the workplace by deploying a wide range of technologies, including machine learning and natural language processing, that can mimic human intelligence to solve problems, make decisions and perform tasks traditionally handled by humans. AI can analyze data, recognize patterns, learn from experience and adapt over time. It is often used to streamline operations, enhance productivity, automate repetitive tasks and support decision-making.\n\nGenerally, deploying AI in the workplace involves a wide ecosystem of technologies, the most common of which are:\n\nMachine learning: A branch of computer science that focuses on using algorithms to allow AI to imitate the way humans learn, gradually improving its functionality over time.\n\nNatural language processing (NLP): A form of AI that uses machine learning to understand and communicate in human language.\n\nGenerative AI: A form of AI recently popularized by ChatGPT that can create original content in response to a user\u2019s request.\n\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA): A process-driven intelligent automation technology often used to perform repetitive office tasks.\n\nUsing a combination of these technologies, deploying AI in the workplace might be as simple as automatically digitizing and filing employee records, or translating Spanish into English. It might be as complex as providing decision-makers with guidance on how to improve a company\u2019s business processes enterprise-wide.\n\nIn the healthcare, insurance and banking industries, AI has become increasingly common.

        "text": "Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI\u2019s full potential (47 pages)\n\nArtificial intelligence has arrived in the workplace and has the potential to be as transformative as the steam engine was to the 19th-century Industrial Revolution. With powerful and capable large language models (LLMs) developed by Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, we have entered a new information technology era. McKinsey research sizes the long-term AI opportunity at $4.4 trillion in added productivity growth potential from corporate use cases.\n\nTherein lies the challenge: the long-term potential of AI is great, but the short-term returns are unclear. Over the next three years, 92 percent of companies plan to increase their AI investments. But while nearly all companies are investing in AI, only 1 percent of leaders call their companies \u201cmature\u201d on the deployment spectrum, meaning that AI is fully integrated into workflows and drives substantial business outcomes. The big question is how business leaders can deploy capital and steer their organizations closer to AI maturity.\n\nThis research report, prompted by Reid Hoffman\u2019s book Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future, asks a similar question: How can companies harness AI to amplify human agency and unlock new levels of creativity and productivity in the workplace? AI could drive enormous positive and disruptive change. This transformation will take some time, but leaders must not be dissuaded. Instead, they must advance boldly today to avoid becoming uncompetitive tomorrow. The history of major economic and technological shifts shows that such moments can define the rise and fall of companies. Over 40 years ago, the internet was born. Since then, companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have attained trillion-dollar market capitalizations. Even more profoundly, the internet changed the anatomy of work and access to information. AI now is like the internet many years ago: The risk for business leaders is not thinking too big, but rather too small.\n\nRegister for upcoming event Despite outpacing men in academic performance and graduation rates, women risk falling behind before they even tap the glass ceiling. In fact, the odds of advancement are lower for women at the pivotal first promotion opportunity to manager: for every 100 men, only 81 women are promoted. \u201cThe Broken Rung,\u201d a new book released on March 11, helps women level the career playing field and maximize their experience capital. Join McKinsey co-authors Kweilin Ellingrud, Lareina Yee, and Mar\u00eda del Mar Mart\u00ednez for a preview of the book on Tuesday, March 11 at 11:00 a.m. EST / 5:00 p.m. CET.\n\nThis report explores companies\u2019 technology and business readiness for AI adoption (see sidebar \u201cAbout the survey\u201d). It concludes that employees are ready for AI. The biggest barrier to success is leadership.\n\nAbout the survey To create our report, we surveyed 3,613 employees (managers and independent contributors) and 238 C-level executives in October and November 2024. Of these, 81 percent came from the United States, and the rest came from five other countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The employees spanned many roles, including business development, finance, marketing, product management, sales, and technology. All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions.\n\nChapter 1 looks at the rapid advancement of technology over the past two years and its implications for business adoption of AI.\n\nChapter 2 delves into the attitudes and perceptions of employees and leaders. Our research shows that employees are more ready for AI than their leaders imagine. In fact, they are already using AI on a regular basis; are three times more likely than leaders realize to believe that AI will replace 30 percent of their work in the next year; and are eager to gain AI skills. Still, AI optimists are only a slight majority in the workplace; a large minority (41 percent) are more apprehensive and will need additional support. This is where millennials, who are the most familiar with AI and are often in managerial roles, can be strong advocates for change.\n\nChapter 3 looks at the need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making bold and responsible decisions.\n\nChapter 4 examines how companies risk losing ground in the AI race if leaders do not set bold goals. As the hype around AI subsides, companies should put a heightened focus on practical applications that empower employees in their daily jobs. These applications can create competitive moats and generate measurable ROI. Across industries, functions, and geographies, companies that invest strategically can go beyond using AI to drive incremental value and instead create transformative change.\n\nChapter 5 looks at what is required for leaders to set their teams up for success with AI. The challenge of AI in the workplace is not a technology challenge. It is a business challenge that calls upon leaders to align teams, address AI headwinds, and rewire their companies for change.\n\nChapter 1 An innovation as powerful as the steam engine\n\nImagine a world where machines not only perform physical labor but also think, learn, and make autonomous decisions. This world includes humans in the loop, bringing people and machines together in a state of superagency that increases personal productivity and creativity (see sidebar \u201cAI superagency\u201d). This is the transformative potential of AI, a technology with a potential impact poised to surpass even the biggest innovations of the past, from the printing press to the automobile. AI does not just automate tasks but goes further by automating cognitive functions. Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software can adapt, plan, guide\u2014and even make\u2014decisions. That\u2019s why AI can be a catalyst for unprecedented economic growth and societal change in virtually every aspect of life. It will reshape our interaction with technology and with one another.\n\nScientific discoveries and technological innovations are stones in the cathedral of human progress. Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and Inflection AI, partner at Greylock Partners, and author\n\nMany breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nAI superagency What impact will AI have on humanity? Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato\u2019s book Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future (Authors Equity, January 2025) explores this question. The book highlights how AI could enhance human agency and heighten our potential. It envisions a human-led, future-forward approach to AI. Superagency, a term coined by Hoffman, describes a state where individuals, empowered by AI, supercharge their creativity, productivity, and positive impact. Even those not directly engaging with AI can benefit from its broader effects on knowledge, efficiency, and innovation. AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably.\n\nOver the past two years, AI has advanced in leaps and bounds, and enterprise-level adoption has accelerated due to lower costs and greater access to capabilities. Many notable AI innovations have emerged (Exhibit 1). For example, we have seen a rapid expansion of context windows, or the short-term memory of LLMs. The larger a context window, the more information an LLM can process at once. To illustrate, Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 could process one million tokens in February 2024, while its Gemini 1.5 Pro could process two million tokens by June of that same year. Overall, we see five big innovations for business that are driving the next wave of impact: enhanced intelligence and reasoning capabilities, agentic AI, multimodality, improved hardware innovation and computational power, and increased transparency.\n\nImage description begins: The text-based exhibit illustrates the evolution of capabilities of several gen AI large language models, or LLMs, from select frontier labs between 2022 and 2025. The is presented as a table comparing two time periods: 2022-2023 and January 2025. For each of five LLMs\u2014Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, Microsoft's Phi, and OpenAI's GPT\u2014the exhibit shows a list of capabilities for each time period. In 2022-2023, all five platforms lacked multimodal capabilities, functioning primarily with text only. Anthropic's Claude, for example, showed limited contextual understanding and no tool usage. Google's Gemini, similarly, had limited real-time data integration and low personalization. Meta's Llama 1 exhibited fair reasoning but had difficulty with complex conversations and lacked API access. Microsoft's Phi-1 had fair reasoning limited to coding tasks, with focused training on a smaller dataset. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 demonstrated fair reasoning, scoring well on the SAT but poorly on the bar examination, while also displaying limited contextual understanding in complex conversations, though it did offer standard API access for text generation. By January 2025, a significant shift is apparent. Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.3, Phi-4, and OpenAI's model o1 all gained multimodal capabilities, incorporating text, audio, and images. Advanced reasoning capabilities, capable of multistep problem-solving and nuanced analysis, became common across most of the platforms. Enhanced contextual understanding, maintaining coherence during long dialogues, is also highlighted as an improvement. Furthermore, real-time data integration and advanced personalization features were added to some platforms. Finally, several platforms highlight improved or advanced API access, allowing for tools related to model and agent development and multimodal inputs. Source: Company websites and press releases.

One indicator is the performance of LLMs on standardized tests. OpenAI\u2019s Chat GPT-3.5, introduced in 2022, demonstrated strong performance on high-school-level exams (for example, scoring in the 70th percentile on the SAT math and the 87th percentile on the SAT verbal sections). However, it often struggled with broader reasoning. Today\u2019s models are near the intelligence level of people who hold advanced degrees. GPT-4 can so easily pass the Uniform Bar Examination that it would rank in the top 10 percent of test takers, and it can answer 90 percent of questions correctly on the US Medical Licensing Examination.\n\nThe advent of reasoning capabilities represents the next big leap forward for AI. Reasoning enhances AI\u2019s capacity for complex decision making, allowing models to move beyond basic comprehension to nuanced understanding and the ability to create step-by-step plans to achieve goals. For businesses, this means they can fine-tune reasoning models and integrate them with domain-specific knowledge to deliver actionable insights with greater accuracy. Models such as OpenAI\u2019s o1 or Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Mode are capable of reasoning in their responses, which gives users a human-like thought partner for their interactions, not just an information retrieval and synthesis engine.\n\nAI in Action: An interactive learning journey\n\nAgentic AI is acting autonomously\n\nI\u2019ve always thought of AI as the most profound technology humanity is working on . . . more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we\u2019ve done in the past. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet\n\nThe ability to reason is growing more and more, allowing models to autonomously take actions and complete complex tasks across workflows. This is a profound step forward. As an example, in 2023, an AI bot could support call center representatives by synthesizing and summarizing large volumes of data\u2014including voice messages, text, and technical specifications\u2014to suggest responses to customer queries. In 2025, an AI agent can converse with a customer and plan the actions it will take afterward\u2014for example, processing a payment, checking for fraud, and completing a shipping action.\n\nSoftware companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a \u201cdigital workforce\u201d where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.\n\nMultimodality is bringing together text, audio, and video\n\nToday\u2019s AI models are evolving toward more advanced and diverse data processing capabilities across text, audio, and video. Over the last two years, we have seen improvements in the quality of each modality. For example, Google\u2019s Gemini Live has improved audio quality and latency and can now deliver a human-like conversation with emotional nuance and expressiveness. Also, demonstrations of Sora by OpenAI show its ability to translate text to video.\n\nHardware innovation is enhancing performance\n\nHardware innovation and the resulting increase in compute power continue to enhance AI performance. Specialized chips allow faster, larger, and more versatile models. Enterprises can now adopt AI solutions that require high processing power, enabling real-time applications and opportunities for scalability. For example, an e-commerce company could significantly improve customer service by implementing AI-driven chatbots that leverage advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs). Using distributed cloud computing, the company could ensure optimal performance during peak traffic periods. Integrating edge hardware, the company could deploy models that analyze photos of damaged products to more accurately process insurance claims.\n\nTransparency is increasing\n\nAI, like most transformative technologies, grows gradually, then arrives suddenly. Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and Inflection AI, partner at Greylock Partners, and author\n\nAI is gradually becoming less risky, but it still lacks greater transparency and explainability. Both are critical for improving AI safety and reducing the potential for bias, which are imperative for widescale enterprise deployment. There is still a long way to go, but new models and iterations are rapidly improving. Stanford University\u2019s Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) reports significant advances in model performance. Its Transparency Index, which uses a scale of 1 to 100, shows that Anthropic\u2019s transparency score increased by 15 points to 51 and Amazon\u2019s more than tripled to 41 between October 2023 and May 2024.\n\nBeyond LLMs, other forms of AI and machine learning (ML) are improving explainability, allowing the outputs of models that support consequential decisions (for example, credit risk assessment) to be traced back to the data that informed them. In this way, critical systems can be tested and monitored on a near-constant basis for bias and other everyday harms that arise from model drift and shifting data inputs, which happens even in systems that were well calibrated before deployment.\n\nAll of this is crucial for detecting errors and ensuring compliance with regulations and company policies. Companies have improved explainability practices and built necessary checks and balances, but they must be prepared to evolve continuously to keep up with growing model capabilities.\n\nAchieving AI superagency in the workplace is not simply about mastering technology. It is every bit as much about supporting people, creating processes, and managing governance. The next chapters explore the nontechnological factors that will help shape the deployment of AI in the workplace.\n\nChapter 2 Employees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up\n\nEmployees will be the ones to make their organizations AI powerhouses. They are more ready to embrace AI in the workplace than business leaders imagine. They are more familiar with AI tools, they want more support and training, and they are more likely to believe AI will replace at least a third of their work in the near future. Now it\u2019s imperative that leaders step up. They have more permission space than they realize, so it\u2019s on them to be bold and capture the value of AI. Now.\n\nPeople are using [AI] to create amazing things. If we could see what each of us can do 10 or 20 years in the future, it would astonish us today. Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI\n\nBeyond the tipping point\n\nIn our survey, nearly all employees (94 percent) and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar \u201cWho is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees\u201d).\n\nThe good news is that our survey suggests three ways companies can accelerate AI adoption and move toward AI maturity.\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit shows the anticipated timeline for US employees' and business leaders\u2019 use of gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily work tasks, presented as two stacked bar charts, one for C-suite respondents and one for employees. The segments are broken down into five categories representing different timeframes: Already using, less than a year, 1-5 years, over 5 years, and don't anticipate it. A final category, not sure, is also included. A key finding highlighted in the chart is that employees are three times more likely to be using gen AI today than their leaders expect (4 percent of C-suite respondents estimate that employees are currently using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks, while 13 percent of employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the C-suite, 16 percent expect employees to start using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within less than a year, 56 percent anticipate such adoption within 1-5 years, 11 percent expect it in over 5 years, and 10 percent don't anticipate employees will ever use gen AI for 30 percent of their work tasks. 3 percent of C-suite respondents are unsure. 34 percent of employees expect to use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their work tasks in less than a year, 37 percent within 1-5 years, 5 percent in over 5 years, and 7 percent don't anticipate ever using it in this way. 4 percent of employees are unsure.

Image description ends.\n\nLeaders can invest more in their employees\n\nWho is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees Our research looked at people who self-identify as \u201cZoomers,\u201d \u201cBloomers,\u201d \u201cGloomers,\u201d and \u201cDoomers\u201d in their attitudes toward AI\u2014a set of archetypes introduced in Superagency. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit). Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work. Image descriptions begins: The exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer. Each archetype's perspective is presented through a series of semicircular sunray charts showing the share of respondents within each group holding specific views. For example, two of the sunrays represent two separate sentiments, \u201chas extensive familiarity with gen AI\u201d and \u201chas at least some familiarity with gen AI.\u201d The Doomer archetype shows 16 percent with extensive familiarity and 71 percent with at least some familiarity. The Gloomer archetype demonstrates significantly higher percentages: 42 percent with extensive familiarity and 94 percent with at least some. The Bloomer archetype shows 55 percent with extensive familiarity and 96 percent with at least some, and the Zoomer archetype shows 67 percent with extensive familiarity and 96 percent with at least some. The exhibit further illustrates employees\u2019 comfort levels with using gen AI results, belief in the net benefits of gen AI within the next five years, and plans to utilize gen AI more in their personal lives. In the Doomer archetype, 47 percent say they are comfortable using gen AI results, 54 percent believe in gen AI\u2019s net benefit within the next five years, and 49 percent plan increased personal use of gen AI. The Gloomer archetype shows markedly higher percentages in these three areas: 79 percent, 82 percent, and 77 percent respectively. The Bloomer and Zoomer archetypes present even higher percentages across these three metrics; for instance, 91 percent of Zoomers are comfortable using gen AI results, 87 percent believe in gen AI\u2019s net benefit within five years, and 85 percent plan to increase their personal use of gen AI. Finally, the exhibit the includes a separate section depicting the share of respondents within each archetype, indicating the size of each group with a series of donut charts. The Doomer group comprises 4 percent of employees, Gloomers are 37 percent, Bloomers are 39 percent, and Zoomers are 20 percent. Source: McKinsey US employee survey, Oct\u2013Nov 2024.

Image description ends.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this chapter, employees anticipate AI will have a dramatic impact on their work. Now they would like their companies to invest in the training that will help them succeed. Nearly half of employees in our survey say they want more formal training and believe it is the best way to boost AI adoption. They also would like access to AI tools in the form of betas or pilots, and they indicate that incentives such as financial rewards and recognition can improve uptake.\n\nYet employees are not getting the training and support they need. More than a fifth report that they have received minimal to no support (Exhibit 3). Outside the United States, employees also want more training (see sidebar \u201cGlobal perspectives on training\u201d).\n\nImage description begins: The first section of the exhibit is a horizontal bar chart showing the percentage of US employees who believe that specific company initiatives would increase their daily use of gen AI tools. Formal gen AI training from their organization scored highest at 48 percent, followed by seamless integration into existing workflows (45 percent), access to gen AI tools (41 percent), and incentives and rewards (40 percent). Lower percentages were observed for usage of gen AI being a requirement for a certification program (30 percent), explicit instructions from managers to use gen AI (30 percent), being involved in the development of the tools (29 percent), and OKRs/KPIs tied to gen AI usage (22 percent). The second section is a stacked pair of segmented bar charts illustrating the perceived level of support for gen AI capability building at their organizations, comparing current vs in three years. This chart shows the distribution of responses across four levels of support: not needed, none/minimal, moderate to significant, and fully supported. Currently, 6 percent of employees report that support for gen AI in their organizations is not needed, 22 percent report they receive none/minimal support, 44 percent report moderate to significant support, and 29 percent report they are fully supported. Looking ahead to three years in the future, these percentages are projected to shift considerably: gen AI support not needed drops to 4 percent, none/minimal support for gen AI usage decreases to 10 percent, moderate to significant support for gen AI usage increases to 56 percent, and fully supported increases to 31 percent.

Image description ends.\n\nSidebar Global perspectives on training To get a clearer picture of global AI adoption trends, we looked at trends across five countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Broadly speaking, these employees and C-suite leaders\u2014the \u201cinternational\u201d group in this report\u2014have similar views of AI as their US peers. In some key areas, however, including the topic of training, their experiences differ. Many international employees are concerned about insufficient training, even though they report receiving far more support than US employees. Some 84 percent of international employees say they receive significant or full organizational support to learn AI skills, versus just over half of US employees. International employees also have more opportunities to participate in developing gen AI tools at work than their US counterparts, with differences of at least ten percentage points in activities such as providing feedback, beta testing, and requesting specific features (exhibit).\n\nC-suite leaders can help millennials lead the way\n\nMany millennials aged 35 to 44 are managers and team leaders in their companies. In our survey, they self-report having the most experience and enthusiasm about AI, making them natural champions of transformational change. Millennials are the most active generation of AI users. Some 62 percent of 35- to 44-year-old employees report high levels of expertise with AI, compared with 50 percent of 18- to 24-year-old Gen Zers and 22 percent of baby boomers over 65 (Exhibit 4). By tapping into that enthusiasm and expertise, leaders can help millennials play a crucial role in AI adoption.\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group. Each row represents a different sentiment, from top to bottom: has extensive familiarity with gen AI, is comfortable using gen AI at work, provides feedback on gen AI tools, and wants to participate in the design of gen AI tools. The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group. The chart reveals that the 35-44 age group exhibits the most positive sentiment across most categories. For example, 90 percent of this group reports being comfortable using gen AI at work, the highest percentage among all age groups for this metric. This group also shows the highest percentage (62 percent) reporting extensive familiarity with gen AI. In contrast, the 55-64 and 65+ age groups consistently show lower percentages across all four metrics, with only 26 percent and 22 percent of employees in these age groups reporting extensive familiarity with gen AI respectively. The 18-24, 25-34, and 45-54 age groups show intermediate levels of positive sentiment, generally lower than the 35-44 group but higher than the 55-64 and 65+ age groups.

Image description ends.\n\nSince many millennials are managers, they can support their teams to become more adept AI users. This helps push their companies toward AI maturity. Two-thirds of managers say they field questions from their team about how to use AI tools at least once a week, and a similar percentage say they recommend AI tools to their teams to solve problems (Exhibit 5).\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit examines US manager respondents and their experiences with gen AI tools. The exhibit is composed of two main sections. The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. The second section explores the use of gen AI tools to resolve team member challenges. This section uses two donut charts, each showing percentages of respondents. The first donut chart indicates that 68 percent of managers report recommending a gen AI tool to solve a team member's challenge in the past month. The second donut chart shows that 86 percent of managers who recommended a gen AI tool report that the tool was successful in resolving the team member\u2019s challenge. Source: McKinsey US employee survey, Oct\u2013Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends.\n\nSince leaders have the permission space, they can be bolder\n\nIn many transformations, employees are not ready for change, but AI is different. Employee readiness and familiarity are high, which gives business leaders the permission space to act. Leaders can listen to employees describe how they are using AI today and how they envision their work being transformed. They also can provide employees with much-needed training and empower managers to move AI use cases from pilot to scale.\n\nIt\u2019s critical that leaders meet this moment. It\u2019s the only way to accelerate the probability that their companies will reach AI maturity. But they must move with alacrity, or they will fall behind.\n\nChapter 3 Delivering speed and safety\n\nAI technology is advancing at record speed. ChatGPT was released about two years ago; OpenAI reports that usage now exceeds 300 million weekly users and that over 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies employ its technology. The internet did not reach this level of usage until the early 2000s, nearly a decade after its inception.\n\nSoon after the first automobiles were on the road, there was the first car crash. But we didn\u2019t ban cars\u2014we adopted speed limits, safety standards, licensing requirements, drunk-driving laws, and other rules of the road. Bill Gates, cofounder of Microsoft\n\nThe majority of employees describe themselves as AI optimists; Zoomers and Bloomers make up 59 percent of the workplace. Even Gloomers, who are one of the two less-optimistic segments in our analysis, report high levels of gen AI familiarity, with over a quarter saying they plan to use AI more next year.\n\nBusiness leaders need to embrace this speed and optimism to ensure that their companies don\u2019t get left behind. Yet despite all the excitement and early experimentation, 47 percent of C-suite leaders say their organizations are developing and releasing gen AI tools too slowly, citing talent skill gaps as a key reason for the delay (Exhibit 6).\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit shows US C-suite executive sentiment toward the pace of development and release of gen AI tools within their organizations, in the form of two segmented bar charts. The first bar chart presents the overall perception of the pace, where 47 percent of respondents find the pace to be too slow, while 45 percent feel it is about right, and a smaller 9 percent consider it too fast. The second bar chart delves into the top reasons behind the perceived slow pace of gen AI tool development and release in executives\u2019 organizations, focusing on the responses from those who indicated that development was too slow. The most prominent reason cited is talent skill gaps, accounting for 46 percent of these responses. Resourcing constraints followed closely, with 38 percent of respondents identifying this as a key factor. Complex approval process and technical complexity each receive 8 percent of the responses. Source: McKinsey US CxO survey, Oct-Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends.\n\nBusiness leaders are trying to meet the need for speed by increasing investments in AI. Of the executives surveyed, 92 percent say they expect to boost spending on AI in the next three years, with 55 percent expecting investments to increase by at least 10 percent from current levels. But they can no longer just spend on AI without expecting results. As companies move on from the initial thrill of gen AI, business leaders face increasing pressure to generate ROI from their gen AI deployments.\n\nWe are at a turning point. The initial AI excitement may be waning, but the technology is accelerating. Bold and purposeful strategies are needed to set the stage for future success. Leaders are taking the first step: One quarter of those executives we surveyed have defined a gen AI road map, while just over half have a draft that is being refined (Exhibit 7). With technology changing this fast, all road maps and plans will evolve constantly. For leaders, the key is to make some clear choices about what valuable opportunities they choose to pursue first\u2014and how they will work together with peers, teams, and partners to deliver that value.\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit is comprised of two horizontal segmented bar charts. The first chart displays the share of US C-suite respondents who have a defined gen AI roadmap. 21 percent report not currently having a roadmap but one was in progress, 53 percent indicate having a roadmap that is still being refined, and 25 percent state that a comprehensive roadmap is already in place. The second bar chart illustrates the level to which US C-suite respondents have identified revenue-generating use cases for gen AI. 1 percent of respondents indicate they have not yet identified any such use cases, while 10 percent report they have minimally identified, 38 percent have partially identified, 39 percent have mostly identified, and 12 percent have fully identified such use cases.

Image description ends\n\nThe dilemma of speed versus safety\n\nThere\u2019s a spanner in the works: Regulation and safety often continue to be seen as insurmountable challenges rather than opportunities. Leaders want to increase AI investments and accelerate development, but they wrestle with how to make AI safe in the workplace. Data security, hallucinations, biased outputs, and misuse (for example, creating harmful content or enabling fraud) are challenges that cannot be ignored. Employees are well aware of AI\u2019s safety challenges. Their top concerns are cybersecurity, privacy, and accuracy (Exhibit 8). But what will it take for leaders to address these concerns while also moving ahead at light speed?\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit shows the share of US employees with concerns regarding gen AI, through a series of proportional area charts, each representing a specific risk associated with gen AI. The size of each chart indicates the percentage of US employees who cite that risk as a concern. Cybersecurity risks are cited by 51 percent of respondents, inaccuracies by 50 percent, and concerns about personal privacy by 43 percent. Intellectual property infringement is a concern for 40 percent of respondents, followed by workforce displacement (35 percent), explainability (34 percent), and equity and fairness (30 percent). Less prominent but still significant concerns were regulatory compliance issues (28 percent), national security (24 percent), damage to organizational reputation (16 percent), environmental impact (15 percent), physical safety (14 percent), and political stability (13 percent). Source: McKinsey US employee survey, Oct\u2013Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends.\n\nEmployees trust business leaders to get it right\n\nWhile employees acknowledge the risks and even the likelihood that AI may replace a considerable portion of their work, they place high trust in their own employers to deploy AI safely and ethically. Notably, 71 percent of employees trust their employers to act ethically as they develop AI. In fact, they trust their employers more than universities, large technology companies, and tech start-ups (Exhibit 9).\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit depicts the share of US employees who highly trust different institutions to deploy gen AI tools responsibly, safely, and ethically. The data is presented as four separate unit charts, each representing a distinct institution: employer, universities, large tech companies, and start-ups. Each unit chart consists of a 10x10 matrix of squares. The number of light blue squares within each grid represents the percentage of employees who express high trust in each institution. The remaining squares are light gray. Employers receive the highest level of trust (71 percent), followed by universities (67 percent), large tech companies (61 percent), and start-ups (51 percent). Source: McKinsey US employee survey, Oct\u2013Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends.\n\nAccording to our research, this is in line with a broader trend in which employees show higher trust in their employers to do the right thing in general (73 percent) than in other institutions, including the government (45 percent). This trust should help leaders act with confidence as they tackle the speed-versus-safety dilemma. That confidence also applies outside the United States, even though employees in other regions may have more desire for regulation (see sidebar \u201cGlobal perspectives on regulation\u201d).\n\nSidebar Global perspectives on regulation A high percentage of international C-suite leaders we surveyed across five regions (Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) are Gloomers, who favor greater regulatory oversight. Between 37 to 50 percent of international C-suite leaders self-identify as Gloomers, versus 31 percent in the United States. This may be because top-down regulation is more accepted in many countries outside the United States. Of the global C-suite leaders surveyed, half or more worry that ethical use and data privacy issues are holding back their employees from adopting gen AI. However, our research shows that attitudes about regulation are not inhibiting the economic expectations of business leaders outside the United States. More than half of the international executives (versus 41 percent of US executives) indicate they want their companies to be among the first adopters of AI, with those in India and Singapore being especially bullish (exhibit). The desire of international business leaders to be AI first movers can be explained by the revenue they expect from their AI deployments. Some 31 percent of international C-suite leaders say they expect AI to deliver a revenue uplift of more than 10 percent in the next three years, versus just 17 percent of US leaders. Indian executives are the most optimistic, with 55 percent expecting a revenue uplift of 10 percent or more over the next three years.\n\nRisk management for gen AI\n\nIn Superagency, Hoffman argues that new risks naturally accompany new capabilities\u2014meaning they should be managed but not necessarily eliminated. Leaders need to contend with external threats, such as infringement on intellectual property (IP), AI-enabled malware, and internal threats that arise from the AI adoption process. The first step in building fit-for-purpose risk management is to launch a comprehensive assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities in each of a company\u2019s businesses. Leaders can then establish a robust governance structure, implement real-time monitoring and control mechanisms, and ensure continuous training and adherence to regulatory requirements.\n\nOne powerful control mechanism is respected third-party benchmarking that can increase AI safety and trust. Examples include Stanford CRFM\u2019s Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) initiative\u2014which offers comprehensive benchmarks to assess the fairness, accountability, transparency, and broader societal impact of a company\u2019s AI systems\u2014as well as MLCommons\u2019s AILuminate tool kit on which researchers from Stanford collaborated. Other organizations such as the Data & Trust Alliance unite large companies to create cross-industry metadata standards that aim to bring more transparency to enterprise AI models.\n\nWhile benchmarks have significant potential to build trust, our survey shows that only 39 percent of C-suite leaders use them to evaluate their AI systems. Furthermore, when leaders do use benchmarks, they opt to measure operational metrics (for example, scalability, reliability, robustness, and cost efficiency) and performance-related metrics (including accuracy, precision, F1 score, latency, and throughput). These benchmarking efforts tend to be less focused on ethical and compliance concerns: Only 17 percent of C-suite leaders who benchmark say it\u2019s most important to measure fairness, bias, transparency, privacy, and regulatory issues (Exhibit 10).\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit presents data on the utilization of benchmarks for gen AI tools among US C-suite executives. The exhibit is in two parts. The first part is a pie chart showing that 39 percent of respondents have benchmark standards for gen AI tools used by their employees. This indicates a significant minority of C-suite executives currently employ such standards. The second part of the exhibit is a horizontal bar chart displaying the benchmarks considered most important by the C-suite respondents. Performance-related benchmarks are deemed most important by 41 percent of respondents. Operational benchmarks follow closely behind, cited by 35 percent of participants. Ethical and compliance benchmarks are a lower priority, selected by 17 percent of the respondents, while other benchmarks account for only 7 percent of responses. This reveals a noteworthy disparity, suggesting C-suite leaders put a stronger emphasis on benchmarking the performance and operational aspects of AI rather than benchmarking ethical considerations. Source: McKinsey US CxO survey, Oct-Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool.

But ignoring ethical considerations can come back to haunt leaders. When employees don\u2019t trust AI systems, they are less likely to accept them. Although benchmarks are not a panacea to eliminate all risk and can\u2019t ensure that AI systems are fully efficient, ethical, and safe, they are a useful tool.\n\nEven companies that excel at all three categories of AI readiness\u2014technology, employees, and safety\u2014are not necessarily scaling or delivering the value expected. Nevertheless, leaders can harness the power of big ambitions to transform their companies with AI. The next chapter examines how.\n\nChapter 4 Embracing bigger ambitions\n\nMost organizations that have invested in AI are not getting the returns they had hoped. They are not winning the full economic potential of AI. About half of C-suite leaders at companies that have deployed AI describe their initiatives as still developing or expanding (Exhibit 11). They have had the time to move further. Our research shows that more than two-thirds of leaders launched their first gen AI use cases over a year ago.\n\nThis is a time when you should be getting benefits [from AI] and hope that your competitors are just playing around and experimenting. Erik Brynjolfsson, professor at Stanford University and director of the Digital Economy Lab at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI)\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit is a horizontally stacked bar graph that shows the percentage of C-suite respondents who describe their gen AI rollouts by maturity stages. 8 percent of respondents report their organizations are in the nascent stage, characterized by minimal gen AI initiatives with no significant impact on employee workflows. A significantly larger portion, 39 percent, describe their organizations as being in the emerging stage, where gen AI pilot projects are starting to show value. The developing stage, where gen AI implementation is changing certain workflows and increasing efficiency, accounts for 31 percent of respondents. 22 percent of respondents place their organizations in the expanding stage, indicating that gen AI is scaled across departments, transforming workflows, and enhancing operations. Finally, only 1 percent of C-suite respondents describe their gen AI rollouts as mature, meaning that gen AI is fundamentally changing how work is done and driving substantial business outcomes. The exhibit highlights that the figures might not add up to 100 percent due to rounding. Source: McKinsey US CxO survey, Oct-Nov 2024.

Common culprits are poorly designed or executed strategies, but a lack of bold ambitions can be just as crippling. This chapter looks at patterns governing today\u2019s investments in AI across industries and suggests the potential awaiting those who can dream bigger.\n\nMethodology To create our report, we surveyed 3,613 employees (managers and independent contributors) and 238 C-level executives in October and November 2024. Of these, 81 percent came from the United States, and the rest came from five other countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The employees spanned many roles, including business development, finance, marketing, product management, sales, and technology. All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions. Due to rounding, percentages may not always sum to 100 percent. Three-quarters of survey respondents in the United States work at organizations generating at least $100 million in annual revenue, and half work at companies with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion. All US C-suite leader respondents work at organizations with annual revenues of at least $1 billion. Looking at workforce size, 20 percent of US respondents work at companies with fewer than 10,000 employees, 49 percent work at companies with between 10,000 and 50,000, and 31 percent work at companies with more than 50,000. The analysis extended far beyond surveys. The researchers also conducted interviews with dozens of C-level executives and industry experts to understand their perspectives on AI\u2019s transformative potential and the steps they are taking to lead their organizations through this transition. The report was further enriched by discussions with experts at Stanford HAI, the Digital Economy Lab at HAI, and McKinsey\u2019s leading AI experts. Our survey and research primarily focus on gen AI; however, it is important to note that participants in the survey may not have consistently differentiated between gen AI and other forms of AI. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive database featuring more than 250 potential AI use cases, building on the 63 gen AI use cases identified by McKinsey\u2019s Digital Practice. This database also incorporates proprietary McKinsey research on personal productivity as well as industry reports, along with secondary research from the US government\u2019s Federal AI Use Case Inventories, NASA, press articles, and public interviews with technology leaders.\n\nAI investments vary by industry\n\nDifferent industries have different AI investment patterns. Within the top 25 percent of spenders, companies in healthcare, technology, media and telecom, advanced industries, and agriculture are ahead of the pack (Exhibit 12). Companies in financial services, energy and materials, consumer goods and retail, hardware engineering and construction, and travel, transport, and logistics are spending less. The consumer industry\u2014despite boasting the second-highest potential for value realization from AI\u2014seems least willing to invest, with only 7 percent of respondents qualifying in the top quartile, based on self-reported percentage of revenue spend on gen AI. That hesitation may be explained by the industry\u2019s low average net margins in mass-market categories and thus higher confidence thresholds for adopting costly organization-wide technology upgrades.\n\nImage description begins: The scatterplot exhibit depicts how companies\u2019 gen AI spend does not match the economic potential in their industries. The exhibit illustrates that several industries with a high economic potential from gen AI are not yet spending significantly on the technology. It shows the relationship between the industry share of overall survey respondents and the industry share of top-quartile gen AI spending. On both axes, the top value is set to 35 percent. The size of each circle represents the economic potential from gen AI in billions of dollars for each industry. Light blue circles represent industries where the share in the top quartile of gen AI spending is higher than their overall survey share. These include healthcare, which has a large circle indicating significant economic potential from gen AI, and technology, also with a substantial circle suggesting large economic potential. Media and telecom and advanced Industries are also shown in light blue to illustrate strong economic potential from gen AI, but with smaller circles indicating less economic potential than healthcare and technology. Agriculture is represented by a small light blue circle. Dark grey circles represent industries where the share in the top quartile of gen AI spending is lower than their overall survey share. These include financial services, which has a large circle showing high economic potential. Energy and materials, consumer goods and retail, hardware engineering and construction, and travel, transportation, and logistics are represented by overlapping circles of varying sizes, implying a range of economic potential. No industry scores higher than 20 percent on the share of overall survey respondents. Some industries such as media and telecom, advanced Industries, and agriculture account for around 5 percent or less of overall survey respondents. Industries that scored high percentages on the share of top-quartile gen AI spending include healthcare and technology.

Image description ends.\n\nIn some industries, employees are cautious\n\nEmployees in the public sector, as well as the aerospace and defense and semiconductor industries, are largely skeptical about the development of AI\u2019s future. In the public sector and aerospace and defense, only 20 percent of employees anticipate that AI will have a significant impact on their daily tasks in the next year, versus roughly two-thirds in media and entertainment (65 percent) and telecom, at 67 percent (Exhibit 13). What\u2019s more, our survey shows that just 31 percent of social sector employees trust that their employers will develop AI safely. That\u2019s the least confidence in any industry; the cross-industry average is 71 percent.\n\nEmployees\u2019 relative caution about AI in these sectors likely reflects near-term challenges posed by external constraints such as rigorous regulatory oversight, outdated IT systems, and lengthy approval processes.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of headroom in some functions\n\nOur research finds that the functional areas where AI presents the greatest economic potential are also those where employee outlook is lukewarm. Employees in sales and marketing, software engineering, customer service, and R&D contribute roughly three-quarters of AI\u2019s total economic potential, but the self-reported optimism of employees in these functions is middling (Exhibit 14). It may be the case that these functions have piloted AI projects, leading employees to be more realistic about AI\u2019s benefits and limitations. Or perhaps the economic potential has made them worry that AI could replace their jobs. Whatever the reasons, leaders in these functions might consider investing more in employee support and elevating the change champions who can improve that sentiment.\n\nImage description begins: The exhibit is made up of a scatter plot and a separate bar chart visualizing the relationship between the potential economic value from gen AI and the share of employees with a positive outlook on gen AI, categorized by business function. The exhibit illustrates that the functions with the employees most optimistic about gen AI are not the functions with the greatest potential economic value from gen AI. The scatter plot displays business functions: sales and marketing, software engineering, customer service, R&D, legal, risk, and compliance, operations, HR, strategy, supply chain, finance, procurement, and IT. Each function is represented by a data point, with its horizontal position indicating the percentage of employees expressing a positive outlook on gen AI, and its vertical position representing the potential economic value of gen AI in those functions, in trillions of dollars. Sales and marketing shows the highest potential economic value and around 50 percent of employees with a positive outlook. Software engineering is the function with second-highest economic potential from gen AI, with again about 50 percent of employees in that function reporting being optimistic about gen AI. Customer service and R&D also show about 50 percent of employees with a positive outlook on gen AI, but a much lower potential economic value. Several functions, such as operations, HR, Strategy, and IT, cluster together with low potential economic value and similarly middling employee optimism. Employes in IT, finance, and procurement are the most optimistic about gen AI, with about 70 percent of employees reporting positive sentiment, but these functions represent low economic potential from gen AI. The adjacent bar chart breaks down the share of the total potential economic value contributed by each function. Sales and marketing accounts for 28 percent of the total potential economic value from gen AI, followed by software engineering at 25 percent. Customer service contributes 11 percent, while R&D contributes 9 percent. The remaining 27 percent is attributed to other functions. Source: McKinsey US CxO survey, Oct-Nov 2024.

Only 19 percent say revenues have increased more than 5 percent, with another 39 percent seeing a moderate increase of 1 to 5 percent, and 36 percent reporting no change (Exhibit 15). And only 23 percent see AI delivering any favorable change in costs.\n\nImage description begins: In this exhibit, a pair of segmented bar charts displays US CxOs\u2019 perceptions of whether gen AI has delivered significant return on investment for their enterprises, with details on whether they believe gen AI has impacted their revenues and costs. The data is divided into two bar graphs, one for revenues and one for costs, each presented as a stacked bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who report various levels of change. In the revenues section, 39 percent of respondents report that gen AI has delivered a revenue increase of 1\u20135 percent, 12 percent report an increase of 6\u201310 percent, and 7 percent report a revenue increase of more than 10 percent. A significant 36 percent report no change in revenue, while a small percentage (2 percent) report a decrease. An additional 3 percent are not tracking revenue related to gen AI, and 2 percent indicate they do not know. The costs section presents a similar breakdown. A substantial 31 percent of respondents report that gen AI has resulted in no change in their organizations\u2019 costs, followed by 29 percent who report an increase of 1\u201310 percent. Furthermore, 17 percent report a cost decrease of 1\u201310 percent, while 6 percent report a decrease of 11\u201319 percent. A smaller percentage of 10 percent indicate a cost increase of 11\u201319 percent, while 4 percent report a cost increase of 20 percent or more. Similar to the revenue section, 2 percent of respondents are not tracking cost changes related to gen AI, and 3 percent indicate they do not know. The exhibit highlights that the figures might not add up to 100 percent due to rounding. Source: McKinsey US CxO survey, Oct-Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends.\n\nDespite this, company leaders are optimistic about the value they can capture in the coming years. A full 87 percent of executives expect revenue growth from gen AI within the next three years, and about half say it could boost revenues by more than 5 percent in that time frame (Exhibit 16). That suggests quite a lot could change for the better over the next few years.\n\nImage description begins: In this exhibit, a segmented bar graph shows the extent to which C-suite executives perceive gen AI will affect their organizations\u2019 revenues over the next three years, and the percentage of respondents who anticipate gen AI will result in different levels of revenue change. The bar graph shows that 36 percent of respondents anticipate that gen AI will deliver a 1-5 percent increase in revenue, 34 percent anticipate a 6-10 percent increase in revenue, and 17 percent anticipate a greater than 10 percent increase in revenue. In contrast, 10 percent of respondents anticipate that gen AI will deliver no change in revenue. A total of 51 percent of respondents anticipate that gen AI will deliver a revenue increase of over 5 percent. No respondents anticipate that gen AI will deliver a decrease in revenue, while 3 percent are not currently tracking revenue changes related to gen AI. Source: McKinsey US CxO survey, Oct-Nov 2024.

Image description ends.\n\nBig ambitions can help solve big problems\n\nTo drive revenue growth and improve ROI, business leaders may need to commit to transformative AI possibilities. As the hype around AI subsides and the focus shifts to value, there is a heightened attention on practical applications that can create competitive moats.\n\n[It] is critical to have a genuinely inspiring vision of the future [with AI] and not just a plan to fight fires. Dario Amodei, cofounder and CEO of Anthropic\n\nTo assess how far along companies are in this shift, we examined three categories of AI applications: personal use, business use, and societal use (see sidebar \u201cAI\u2019s potential to enhance our personal lives\u201d). We mapped over 250 applications from our work and publicly shared examples to understand the spectrum of impact levels, from localized use cases to transformations with more universal impact. Our conclusion? Given that most companies are early in their AI journeys, most AI applications are localized use cases still in the pilot stages (Exhibit 17).\n\nImage description begins: This text-based exhibit illustrates how gen AI use cases can be categorized by their impact levels, ranging from localized impact to universal impact. The text table presents three sections of gen AI deployments: use cases, domains, and transformations. Within each section, examples of gen AI applications are shown, with colored dots indicating whether the type of primary impact for each example is personal, business, or societal. The use cases section focuses on gen AI deployments that provide productivity boosts through automation of specific tasks or jobs. Examples include conducting smarter searches for everyday information (personal), planning events (personal), assessing candidate recruiting performance (business), accelerating contract generation (business), processing customer information faster (business), and identifying high-value consumers for tailored sales actions (business). These gen AI examples are all positioned on the more localized end of the impact spectrum. The domains section shows gen AI applications that reshape multiple roles across an area of operations. These are all classified as having a primary business impact and include developing and executing data-based campaigns, conducting synthetic customer research, conducting real-time supply chain monitoring, and accelerating coding processes. These use cases fall in the middle of the spectrum between more localized and more universal impact levels. Finally, the transformations section highlights use cases that fundamentally reshape industries, fields, and lives. These are positioned at the more universal end of the impact spectrum and include accelerating discovery and manufacturing in material science (business), predicting natural disasters and supporting crisis management strategy (societal), and accelerating drug development by reducing cost and time (societal). This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends.\n\nIn many cases, that\u2019s perfectly appropriate. But creating AI applications that can revolutionize industries and create transformative value requires something more. Robotics in manufacturing, predictive AI in renewable energy, drug development in life sciences, and personalized AI tutors in education\u2014these are the kinds of transformative efforts that can drive the greatest returns. These weren\u2019t created from a reactive mindset. They are the result of inspirational leadership, a unique concept of the future, and a commitment to transformational impact. This is the kind of courage needed to develop AI applications that can revolutionize industries.\n\nIt is in [the] collaboration between people and algorithms that incredible scientific progress lies over the next few decades. Demis Hassabis, cofounder and CEO of Google DeepMind\n\nTo truly harness the potential of AI, companies must challenge themselves to envision and implement more breakthrough initiatives. Success in the era of AI hinges not just on technology deployment or employee willingness but also on visionary leadership. The ingredients are here. The technology is already highly capable and rapidly advancing, and employees are more ready than leaders think. Leaders have more permission space than they realize to deploy AI quickly in the workplace. To do so, leaders need to stretch their ambitions toward systematic change, laying the foundation for real competitive differentiation. If they want to be more ambitious about AI, companies must increase the proportion of transformational initiatives in their portfolios. The next chapter examines the headwinds that leaders must overcome\u2014and how they can do so.\n\nSidebar AI\u2019s potential to enhance our personal lives Outside of the business context, individuals are increasingly using AI in their personal lives. In previous research, we analyzed the potential impact of AI across 77 personal activities and across age, gender, and working status in the United States. While individuals have limited desire to automate certain personal activities, including leisure, sleeping, and fitness, the data shows significant opportunity for AI combined with other technologies to help with chores or labor-intensive tasks. Already in 2024, our research identified about an hour of such daily activities with the technical potential to be automated. By 2030, expansion of use cases and continued improvements in AI safety could increase automation potential up to three hours per day. When people use AI-enabled tools\u2014say, an autonomous vehicle for transportation or an interactive personal finance bot\u2014they can repurpose time for personal fulfillment activities or being productive in other ways. Using human-centric design and tapping into gen AI\u2019s potential for \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d are unlocking new personal AI applications that go beyond basic efficiencies. Individuals are beginning to use conversational and reasoning AI models for counseling, coaching, and creative expression. For example, people are using conversational AI for advice and emotional support or to bring their artistic visions to life with only verbal cues. Further, to the notion that AI superagency will advance society, AI has potential to become a democratizing force, making experiences that were previously expensive or exclusive\u2014such as animation generation, career coaching, or tax advice\u2014available to much wider audiences.\n\nChapter 5 Technology is not the barrier to scale\n\nThere is no question: AI offers a rare and phenomenal opportunity. Almost 90 percent of leaders anticipate that deploying AI will drive revenue growth in the next three years. But securing that growth entails corporate transformation, and businesses have a poor track record in this area. Nearly 70 percent of transformations fail.\n\nAs we build this next generation of AI, we made a conscious design choice to put human agency both at a premium and at the center of the product. For the first time, we have the access to AI that is as empowering as it is powerful. Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft\n\nTo make their companies part of the minority that succeed, C-level executives must turn the mirror on themselves. They need to embrace the vital role their leadership plays. C-suite leaders participating in our survey are more than twice as likely to say employee readiness is a barrier to adoption as they are to blame their own role. But as previously noted, employees indicate that they are quite ready.\n\nThis chapter looks at how leaders can take the reins, recognizing and owning the fact that the AI opportunity requires more than technology implementation. It demands a strategic transformation. There is no denying that companies face a set of AI headwinds. To tackle these challenges, leadership teams will need to commit to rewiring their enterprises.\n\nThe operational headwinds that slow execution\n\nBusiness adoption of AI faces several operational headwinds. Our interviews and research surfaced five that are most challenging: aligning leadership, addressing cost uncertainty, workforce planning, managing supply chain dependencies, and meeting the demand for explainability.\n\nLeadership alignment is a challenging but critical first step\n\nSecuring consensus from senior leaders on a strategy-led gen AI road map is no simple task. The key to meeting this challenge is first recognizing that leadership alignment cannot be oversimplified or assumed. The process requires ongoing engagement from senior leaders across business domains, each of which may have distinct objectives and risk appetites. Together, leaders must clearly define where value lies, how AI will drive this value, and how risk will be mitigated. They must collectively establish metrics for performance evaluation and investment recalibration. To facilitate alignment, they may want to appoint a gen AI value and risk leader or institute an enterprise-wide leadership and orchestration function. These actions can enhance collaboration among business, technology, and risk teams. Although challenging, aligning leadership is a crucial step to ensure that AI projects are not disparate, avoid liability, and deliver transformative business outcomes.\n\nCost uncertainty makes it difficult for enterprises to predict ROI\n\nMany companies are still determining if they can \u201ctake\u201d AI solutions off the shelf from tech vendors or if they need to \u201cshape\u201d and customize them, which can be more costly but brings the potential for greater differentiation from competitors. Additionally, while leaders can budget for AI pilots, the full cost of building and managing AI applications at scale remains uncertain. Planning for a limited pilot is very different from assessing the costs of a mature solution that helps most employees multiple times a day. These factors lead to tough tradeoffs. But to move at the pace of AI, technology leaders must prioritize accelerated decision-making.\n\nWorkforce planning is more difficult than ever\n\nThere is still a world of uncertainty to manage. Employers do not know how many AI experts they will need with what type of skills, whether that talent bench even exists, how quickly they can source people, and how they can remain an attractive employer for in-demand hires after they come aboard. On the other hand, they do not know how fast AI may depress demand for other skills and thus require workforce rebalancing and retraining.\n\nSupply chain dependencies can wreak havoc\n\nFragile supply chains can expose enterprises to disruptions and technical, regulatory, and legal challenges. The AI supply chain is global, with significant R&D concentrated in China, Europe, and North America and with semiconductor and hardware manufacturing concentrated in East Asia and the United States. Today\u2019s geopolitics are complex. Furthermore, models and applications are increasingly created in open-source forums spanning many countries.\n\nDemand for greater explainability is a central challenge\n\nSafe AI deployment is increasingly a must-have. Yet most LLMs are often black boxes that do not reveal why or how they came to a certain response, nor what data was used to make it. If AI models cannot provide clear justifications for their responses, recommendations, decisions, or actions\u2014showing the specific factors that led to a credit card application denial, for example\u2014they will not be trusted for critical tasks.\n\nThese AI-specific headwinds are formidable but addressable. Companies are pushing ahead. For example, they might use dynamic cost planning or look at procuring NVIDIA clusters to secure the infrastructure they expect to need. Chief HR officers (CHROs) are developing training programs to upskill their current workforces and support some employees in job transitions. But lasting success will take more than that.\n\nTo capture AI value, leaders must rewire their companies\n\nMcKinsey\u2019s Rewired framework includes six foundational elements to guide sustained digital transformation: road map, talent, operating model, technology, data, and scaling (Exhibit 18). When companies implement this playbook successfully, they cultivate a culture of autonomy, leverage modern cloud practices, and assemble multidisciplinary agile teams.\n\nImage description begins: The text-based exhibit is a framework outlining six key success factors for tech-business transformations. It's structured as a grid with a title, \u201cFramework for the coordinated execution of value creation,\" and is further divided into six rectangular sections, each representing a different success factor. An overarching section, business-led digital road map, focuses on the importance of an organization aligning senior leadership to create a clear vision, value proposition, and roadmap for transformation, thereby improving the customer experience and competitiveness. The next four sections are categories representing the core operational aspects of a business-tech transformation. Talent emphasizes the importance of having employees with the right skills and capabilities to execute and innovate. Operating model highlights the need for organizations to relentlessly focus on value creation by integrating business, technology, and operations. Technology stresses the importance of using technology effectively through adoption of the right platforms, solutions, and practices to drive innovation. Finally, data and AI focuses on why it\u2019s essential to provide people in the organization with easy access to high-quality data and to leverage AI insights to enhance customer experiences and business operations. The final section, underpinning the four category sections, is activation and scaling. This section underscores the need for organizations to maximize value capture by ensuring the activation and enterprise scaling of digital solutions, while carefully managing the transformation's progress and mitigating risks. This image description was completed with the assistance of Writer, a gen AI tool. Image description ends.\n\nWhile these six elements are universally applicable, AI has introduced a few important wrinkles for leaders to address:\n\nAdaptability. AI technology is advancing so rapidly that organizations must adopt new best practices quickly to stay ahead of the competition. Best practices may come in the form of new technologies, talent, business models, or products. For example, a modular approach helps future-proof tech stacks. As natural language becomes a medium for integration, AI systems are becoming more compatible, allowing businesses to swap, upgrade, and integrate models and tools with less friction. This modularity allows enterprises to avoid vendor lock-in and put new AI advancements to use quickly without constantly reinventing their tech stacks.\n\nFederated governance models. Managing data and models can give teams autonomy to develop new AI tools while centrally controlling risk. Leaders can directly oversee high-risk or high-visibility issues, such as setting policies and processes to monitor models and outputs for fairness, safety, and explainability. But they can set direction and delegate other monitoring to business units, including measuring performance-based criteria such as accuracy, speed, and scalability.\n\nBudget agility. Given technological advances across models, as well as the opportunity to curate an optimal mix of LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and agents, business leaders should keep their budgets flexible. This helps enterprises optimize their AI deployments simultaneously for costs and performance.\n\nAI benchmarks. These tools can serve as powerful means to quantitatively assess, compare, and improve the performance of different AI models, algorithms, and systems. If technologists come together to adopt standardized public benchmarks\u2014and if more C-level executives start employing benchmarks, including ethical ones\u2014model transparency and accountability will improve and AI adoption will increase, even among more skeptical employees.\n\nAI-specific skill gaps. Notably, 46 percent of leaders identify skill gaps in their workforces as a significant barrier to AI adoption. Leaders will need to attract and hire top-level talent, including AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and AI integration specialists. They will also need to commit to creating an environment that is attractive to technologists. For example, this can mean providing them with plenty of time to experiment, offering access to cutting-edge tools, creating opportunities to engage in open-source communities, and promoting a collaborative engineering culture. Upskilling existing employees is just as critical: Research from McKinsey\u2019s People and Organizational Performance Practice underscores the importance of tailoring training to specific roles, such as offering technical team members bootcamps on library creation while offering prompt engineering classes to specific functional teams.\n\nHuman centricity. To guarantee both fairness and impartiality, it is important that business leaders incorporate diverse perspectives early and often in the AI development process and maintain transparent communication with their teams. As it stands, less than half of C-suite leaders (48 percent) say they would involve nontechnical employees in the early development stages of AI tools, specifically ideation and requirement gathering. Agile pods and human-centric development practices such as design-thinking and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) will help leaders and developers create AI solutions that all people want to use. In agile pods, technical team members sit alongside employees from business functions such as HR, sales, and product, and from support functions such as legal and compliance. Further, leaders can empathize with employees\u2019 uneasiness about AI\u2019s impacts on potential job losses by being honest about new skill requirements and head count changes. Forums where employees can provide input on AI applications, voice concerns, and share ideas are valuable for maintaining a transparent, human-first culture.\n\nConclusion Meeting the AI future\n\nThe pace at which AI has advanced over the last two years is stunning. Some react to that pace by seeing AI as a challenge to humanity. But what if we take the advice of Reid Hoffman and imagine what could possibly go right with AI? Leaders might realize that all the pieces are in place for AI superagency in the workplace.\n\nLearn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. Albert Einstein, theoretical physicist\n\nThey might notice that their employees are already using AI and want to use it even more. They may find that millennial managers are powerful change champions ready to encourage their peers. Instead of focusing on the 92 million jobs expected to be displaced by 2030, leaders could plan for the projected 170 million new ones and the new skills those will require.\n\nThis is the moment for leaders to set bold AI commitments and to meet employee needs with on-the-job training and human-centric development. As leaders and employees work together to reimagine their businesses from the bottom up, AI can evolve from a productivity enhancer into a transformative superpower\u2014an effective partner that increases human agency. Leaders who can replace fear of uncertainty with imagination of possibility will discover new applications for AI, not only as a tool to optimize existing workflows but also as a catalyst to solve bigger business and human challenges. Early stages of AI experimentation focused on proving technical feasibility through narrow use cases, such as automating routine tasks. Now the horizon has shifted: AI is poised to unlock unprecedented innovation and drive systemic change that delivers real value.\n\nGlossary The following terms in this report are defined specifically for its context. Adoption and deployment: Deployment typically refers to the extent to which an organization rolls out a technology product (whether developed in-house or purchased off the shelf), and adoption reflects how extensively these products are used to generate measurable business value. Given the emerging nature of AI, many companies are simultaneously deploying and adopting, iterating as they go. Therefore, this report often uses adoption and deployment interchangeably to refer to the overall uptake of AI tools. Agentic AI: Systems with autonomy and goal-directed behavior capable of making independent decisions, planning, and adapting to achieve specific objectives without direct, ongoing human input. Application programming interface (API): Intermediary software components that allow two applications to talk to each other; a structured way for AI systems to programmatically access (usually external) models, data sets, or other pieces of software. Artificial Intelligence (AI): The ability of software to perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, mirroring some cognitive functions usually associated with human minds. Deep learning: A subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks, which are layers of connected \u201cneurons\u201d whose connections have parameters or weights that can be trained. Deep learning is especially effective at learning from unstructured data such as images, text, and audio. Digital workforce: A collaborative ecosystem where humans and automated agents work together, leveraging digital platforms, AI, and cloud computing to enhance productivity, efficiency, and scalability across various industries. Employee: A worker in a corporate setting, either a manager or independent contributor. Examples of the type of employees represented in this report include people working in product management, marketing, technology, business development, sales, and finance. Foundation models: Deep learning models trained on vast quantities of unstructured, unlabeled data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the box or adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning. Examples of these models are DALL-E 2, GPT-4, PaLM, and Stable Diffusion. Generative AI (gen AI): AI that is typically built using foundation models and has capabilities that earlier forms Iacked, such as the ability to generate content. Foundation models can also be used for nongenerative purposes (for example, classifying user sentiment as negative or positive based on call transcripts). Graphics processing units (GPUs): Computer chips originally developed for producing computer graphics, such as for video games, that are also useful for deep learning applications. In contrast, traditional machine learning usually runs on central processing units (CPUs), normally referred to as a computer\u2019s \u201cprocessor.\u201d Hallucination: A scenario where an AI system generates outputs that lack grounding in reality or a provided context. For instance, an AI chatbot may fabricate information or present a false narrative. Large language models (LLMs): A class of foundation models that can process massive amounts of unstructured text and learn the relationships between words or portions of words, known as tokens. This enables LLMs to generate natural-language text, performing tasks such as summarization or knowledge extraction. GPT-4 (which underlies ChatGPT) and the Llama family of models from Meta are examples of LLMs. Modality: A high-level data category such as numbers, text, images, video, and audio. Multimodal capabilities: The ability of an AI system to process and generate various types of data (text, images, audio, video) simultaneously, enabling complex tasks and rich outputs. Productivity (from labor): The ratio of GDP to total hours worked in the economy. Labor productivity growth generally comes from increases in the amount of capital available to each worker, the education and experience of the workforce, and improvements in technology. Prompt engineering: The process of designing, refining, and optimizing input prompts to guide a gen AI model toward producing desired and accurate outputs. Reasoning AI: AI systems that perform logical thinking, step-by-step planning, problem solving, and decision making using structured or unstructured data, going beyond pattern recognition to draw conclusions and solve complex problems. Superagency: A state where individuals, empowered by AI, amplify their creativity, productivity, and positive impact. Even those not directly engaging with AI can benefit from its broader effects on knowledge, efficiency, and innovation. Unstructured data: Data that lack a consistent format or structure (for example, text, images, video, and audio files) and typically require more advanced techniques to extract insights.\n\nTo meet this more ambitious era, leaders and employees must ask themselves big questions. How should leaders define their strategic priorities and steer their companies effectively amid disruption? How can employees ensure they are ready for the AI transition coming to their workplaces? Questions like the following ones will shape a company\u2019s AI future:\n\nFor business leaders:\n\nIs your strategy ambitious enough? Do you want to transform your whole business? How can you reimagine traditional cost centers as value-driven functions? How do you gain a competitive advantage by investing in AI?\n\nDo you want to transform your whole business? How can you reimagine traditional cost centers as value-driven functions? How do you gain a competitive advantage by investing in AI? What does successful AI adoption look like for your organization? What success indicators will you use to evaluate whether your investments are yielding desired ROI?\n\nWhat skills define an AI-native workforce? How can you create opportunities for employees to develop these skills on the job?\n\nFor employees:\n\nWhat does achieving AI mastery mean for you? Does it extend to confidently using AI for personal productivity tasks such as research, planning, and brainstorming?\n\nHow do you plan to expand your understanding of AI? Which news sources, podcasts, and video channels can you follow to remain informed about the rapid evolution of AI?\n\nHow can you rethink your own work? Some of the most innovative ideas often emerge from within teams, rather than being handed down from leadership. How would you redesign your work to drive bottom-up innovation?\n\nThese questions have no easy answers, but a consensus is emerging on how to best address them. For example, some companies deploy both bottom-up and top-down approaches to drive AI adoption. Bottom-up actions help employees experiment with AI tools through initiatives such as hackathons and learning sessions. Top-down techniques bring executives together to radically rethink how AI could improve major processes such as fraud management, customer experience, and product testing.\n\nThese kinds of actions are critical as companies seek to move from AI pilots to AI maturity. Today only 1 percent of business leaders report that their companies have reached maturity. Over the next three years, as investments in the technology grow, leaders must drive that percentage way up. They should make the most of their employees\u2019 readiness to increase the pace of AI implementation while ensuring trust, safety, and transparency. The goal is simple: capture the enormous potential of gen AI to drive innovation and create real business value.",

The internal workings of such systems may not be well understood, even by the developers who create them. We explore the challenges this poses for employers seeking to ensure that their use of AI in employment decisions does not inadvertently introduce bias into the process. Be sure to tune in for a closer look at the complexities of this conundrum and what it means for employers.\n\nGuy Brenner: Welcome again to The Proskauer Brief: Hot Topics in Labor and Employment Law. I\u2019m Guy Brenner, a partner in Proskauer\u2019s Employment Litigation & Counseling group, based in Washington, D.C. I\u2019m joined by my colleague, Jonathan Slowik, a special employment law counsel in the practice group, based in Los Angeles. This is part three of a multi-part series on potential pitfalls in the use of artificial intelligence (or AI) when it comes to employment decisions, such as hiring and promotions. Jonathan, thank you for joining me today.\n\nJonathan Slowik: It\u2019s great to be here, Guy.\n\nGuy Brenner: If you haven\u2019t heard the earlier installments of this series, we encourage you to go back and listen to them. In part one, we go through what we hope is some useful background about what AI solutions are out there for employers and HR departments, including tools like r\u00e9sum\u00e9 scanners, chatbots, interviewing platforms, social media tools, job fit tests, and performance reviews. In part two, we discuss how issues with training data can lead to biased or otherwise problematic outputs. Today\u2019s episode is about what we call \u201cblack box\u201d issues. Jonathan, what do we mean when we refer to an AI being a \u201cblack box\u201d?\n\nJonathan Slowik: So a \u201cblack box\u201d system draws conclusions without providing any explanations as to how those conclusions were reached. This is also sometimes referred to as \u201cmodel opacity\u201d\u2014we can\u2019t see what it\u2019s doing under the hood. In fact, the internal workings of a black box system might not be clear even to the developer that built it. For example, the AI developer Anthropic has spent significant resources on research to better understand the workings of its large language model, Claude, and it was considered big news in the industry when they published a paper in May 2024 announcing some preliminary findings.\n\nGuy Brenner: That\u2019s pretty sobering \u2013 even the developers don\u2019t know exactly how it works. So, putting aside the larger questions prompted by this fact, why should an employer care if an AI is a black box?\n\nJonathan Slowik: Well, if it\u2019s difficult to understand why a system is doing what it\u2019s doing, it can also be difficult to evaluate whether what it\u2019s doing is unbiased or using inappropriate criteria. There was another interesting study that also came out this spring that examined what the researchers call the overt and covert biases of large language models, or LLMs, like Claude, or the many chat bots that that many of us have come to rely on for all kinds of things. There was another interesting study that also came out this spring that examined what the researchers called the overt and covert biases of large language models, or LLMs, like the chat bots that a lot of us have come to rely on for all kinds of things. LLMs are trained on our own speech and writing, and the most advanced versions of trained on, for example, a significant portion of the internet. And so this vast corpus of data and writing naturally includes some ugly stereotypes. And perhaps unsurprisingly then, early versions of this technology exhibited that bias in its responses. That\u2019s obviously a huge problem. No one wants to be putting out a racist chat bot, and these are the public developers solve for this problem primarily through what\u2019s called human feedback training.\n\nThis is a process kind of like sites like Reddit where people upvote or down vote things people say. In this process, a human being or a large number of human beings review a large number of outputs from the model and essentially good outputs and downvote bad outputs. This feedback trains the AI not to give racist outputs and to give more accurate outputs, but the researchers found that even advanced alums were exhibiting implicit bias against racial minorities. So over time, through this human feedback training, the LLMs had gotten very good at mimicking real people and for the most part, most of us don\u2019t say racist things out loud, thank goodness. But real people may harbor biases underneath the surface, consciously or not.\n\nGuy Brenner: Jonathan, as I listen to you, the implications of this for employers are pretty evident and profound. If an employer cannot know for sure that under the hood, the AI is operating in a way that is unbiased, that means that biases might only become apparent over time and after the fact. In these contexts, bias audits could be critical to mitigating the risk of algorithmic discrimination.\n\nJonathan Slowik: That\u2019s exactly right. And that\u2019s one reason why lawmakers and regulators, as they grapple with the issues created by these new AI tools, have been especially focused on bias audits as they begin to craft implement specific regulations for AI.\n\nGuy Brenner: So what are we going to discuss in the next episode, Jonathan?\n\nJonathan Slowik: In the next episode, we\u2019ll explore mismatches between a platform\u2019s design and its end use as we\u2019ll discuss. Even a purportedly unbiased system can produce biased results if it\u2019s used for an unintended purpose.\n\nGuy Brenner: Well, thanks Jonathan. And to those listening and joining us on The Proskauer Brief today.

        "text": "AI will make finance more efficient, reduce inefficiencies and empower professionals to do more with less. But the need for human judgment, leadership and risk-taking? That's not going anywhere, writes Scott Weller, of EnFi. Adobe Stock\n\nIt's easy to blame artificial intelligence for layoffs on Wall Street. The headlines are alarming: 200,000 job cuts expected, 41% of firms planning to reduce headcount by 2030. It all sounds like the makings of a workforce apocalypse. But when you look past the fearmongering, the reality is far more nuanced. AI isn't displacing jobs \u2014 it's reshaping them .\n\nLayoffs are real, but they aren't the fault of AI. The driving forces behind workforce reductions remain the same as they always have: market cycles, economic headwinds and strategic realignments. Wall Street firms aren't slashing jobs because AI has suddenly rendered analysts and traders obsolete. They're tightening belts in response to rising interest rates, lower deal flow and shifting financial priorities.\n\nNow, let's talk about AI's actual capabilities \u2014 because they are far from what the headlines might suggest. The financial services industry demands precision. A single mistake can mean millions of dollars in losses, and AI, for all its promise, isn't ready for that kind of responsibility. OpenAI's Deep Research recently scored just 55% on key financial benchmarks. Would you trust your investments to a system that's only slightly more reliable than a coin toss? Banks certainly won't.\n\nFinance is built on expertise, judgment and a deep understanding of risk. A seasoned analyst doesn't just crunch numbers \u2014 they challenge assumptions, stress-test models and interpret signals in ways no machine can replicate. The ability to navigate uncertainty, to weigh not just data but history, sentiment and political context, is what sets human decision-makers apart. AI might be good at finding patterns, but it doesn't ask why those patterns matter.\n\nThat's why AI isn't replacing jobs at scale. If it were, we wouldn't see over 30,000 open positions in finance for risk analysts and loan officers. The reality is AI excels at automating tedious, back-office tasks \u2014 the kind of work often outsourced to consultants or contractors. It can reformat spreadsheets, extract data from reports and speed up rote processing, but it's not making executive decisions or managing portfolios.\n\nThere's another misconception worth addressing: The idea that AI performs equally well in any hands. In truth, AI is a force multiplier for expertise. Give the same AI tool to a junior analyst and a veteran investment banker, and you'll see vastly different outcomes. Not because the AI is biased, but because experience dictates how well one can harness it. This is where the human edge remains irreplaceable.\n\nAnd let's not forget a fundamental truth: AI doesn't take risks. It can optimize, model and analyze, but it doesn't bet on the future. It doesn't have the instinct to back a transformative idea, or the courage to go against the grain. Investors, lenders and entrepreneurs take calculated risks every day \u2014 AI merely processes probabilities. That's a big difference.\n\nConsider crisis management. When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, regulators didn't turn to an AI model for leadership. They made judgment calls \u2014 when to intervene, how to stabilize confidence, how to communicate with the market. AI could have flagged warning signs, but it wouldn't have had the wisdom to navigate the fallout. Because financial markets aren't just about logic. They run on confidence, human judgment and institutional experience \u2014 things AI can't replicate.\n\nNow, let's be clear: AI will reshape jobs. Over time, automation will eliminate some roles, as it always has. But today's concerns about AI-driven mass layoffs are overblown, particularly in finance, where trust, regulation and complexity act as natural barriers to disruption. AI is a tool for augmentation, not replacement \u2014 at least for now.\n\nWall Street has weathered waves of technological change before, from algorithmic trading to electronic markets, and each time the industry has evolved, not disappeared. This time is no different. AI will make finance more efficient, reduce inefficiencies and empower professionals to do more with less. But the need for human judgment, leadership and risk-taking? That's not going anywhere.",

However, a new survey suggests that most American workers aren't yet using it.\n\nWhile about one in six workers use AI to do at least some of their jobs, the remainder were considered to be \"non-AI users,\" a Pew Research Center survey published Tuesday said.\n\nThe non-AI user group is broken down by 63% of respondents who rarely or never use AI in their jobs, and 17% who have not heard of AI use in the workplace.\n\nThe research, which surveyed 5,273 employed US adults in October, suggests that for all the hype around AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini, tech giants still have some persuading to do to ensure their massive bets pay off.\n\nAmazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are collectively planning to spend more than $320 billion on AI-related capital expenditures in 2025. They are doing so on the premise that business demand for AI tools will continue to grow, requiring more chips and data centers to power those services.\n\nGoogle has made AI a central part of its business strategy, integrating tools like Gemini Advanced and NotebookLM into its Workspace enterprise plans. More than 100,000 customers have already adopted Google's AI tools, the company said in January.\n\nMicrosoft is making a similarly aggressive push with its Copilot AI assistant. However, Copilot has faced challenges. Last year, Business Insider reported that the reviews of Copilot \u2014 both inside and outside Microsoft \u2014 indicate that the new product is struggling to live up to the hype.\n\nOpenAI kicked off the AI boom in late 2022 with ChatGPT, its chatbot that captured the attention of businesses and consumers alike. However, the Pew Research Center survey said that only about one in 10 workers use AI chatbots every day or a few times a week in their jobs.\n\nOne reason for the seemingly slow adoption of AI tools could be the lack of an integration strategy among businesses, said Doug Winter, the CEO and founder of Seismic, the sales software company.\n\n\"There's a constant stream of new AI tools promising to revolutionize the workplace,\" Winter told BI. \"Many businesses rush to adopt them without clear integration strategies. This applies pressure on employees to quickly adapt and utilize multiple new technologies, often leading to tool fatigue.\"\n\nThe Pew survey also asked employees how they thought AI would affect the job market in the coming years. More than half \u2014 52% \u2014 of those surveyed said they were more worried than hopeful about AI's long-term impact on the workplace.",

health plans and provide real-time updates on deductible and out-of-pocket usages.\n\nThe tool is not designed to take the place of human representatives, which are still available to consumers for questions on claims or billing, but rather to address the comprehension gap and evaluate which problems require further intervention.\n\n\"AI is really good at assessing that initial [problem],\" Brandon Weber, co-founder and CEO of Nava Benefits, said in a prior interview with EBN's Deanna Cuadra. \"But to take action because we have an error that needs to be fixed by the [healthcare]

increased use of artificial intelligence in the workplace and want to see it banned permanently.\n\nFurther findings showed that a separate 45% will significantly impact their job security in the future, and 38% of workers feel they will have to retrain for a new position following their current role being outmoded by the introduction of AI.\n\n\"AI is transforming industries at a rapid pace,

used to educate younger professionals, giving them a sense of independence when navigating the workplace while not being overreliant on other staff.\n\n\"Gen Z is having trouble adapting to the culture of work because they entered into the workplace at a time of high volatility, coming out of the pandemic with offices shifting between different work models,\" John Scott, head of learning and

        "text": "Much has been said about the potential benefits of artificial intelligence on businesses, but there is not enough information about the technology\u2019s impact on the workers themselves.\n\nDiscussions around generative AI, for example, tend to focus on how the nascent tech can help improve workplace productivity. What is often left out is how AI tools can have profound effects on the people using them, and not all are positive.\n\nHere is an overview of three aspects of work that prove the ripple effects of AI adoption extend beyond productivity and efficiency \u2013 they affect work as a creative endeavour:\n\nAI and the future of employment\n\nWhether pundits admit it at this point, the wider adoption of AI in 2024 has directly and indirectly led to job displacements, particularly in the mad rush to lay off workers and cut costs in the past 12 months.\n\nAs automation replaces certain tasks traditionally performed by humans, this idea of displacement creates anxiety and uncertainty among workers regarding their job security and future employment opportunities.\n\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that as many as 85 million workers could lose their jobs by 2050 due to the rapid adoption of AI among large and midsize businesses. AI and automation have caused a noticeable decrease in the demand for certain roles, such as in data entry, accounting, and administrative support.\n\nThe same WEF report revealed just how popular AI adoption has become among companies, as more than 80% of those interviewed by WEF said they are accelerating the digitalisation of work processes and the deployment of new tech.\n\nMeanwhile, half of employers said they expect to accelerate the automation of certain roles within their organisations.\n\nThese results depict the changing employment landscape \u2013 even to a point where humans could soon find themselves without jobs or competing intensely with AI rivals for their livelihood.\n\nAI and the future of skills\n\nThe integration of AI at work is also prompting workers to reassess their skills and develop new and existing competencies quickly. This can lead to stress for those who are already struggling to adapt to a new tech-driven reality or who might feel overwhelmed by the need to continuously upskill.\n\nWhile learning agility is a trait celebrated in modern business, the flipside of agility \u2013 learning fatigue \u2013 is a real struggle in the age of digitalisation.\n\nThe WEF predicts 97 million new roles will emerge as AI and automation become more commonplace. Most of these jobs can be found in the care economy and in content creation fields. There is also an expected surge in demand for workers in green economies, as well as those in the data and AI economy. As these new opportunities open up, three vital questions remain:\n\nDo the competencies of the world\u2019s current talent pool match the skilling demands of these growing sectors? In the case of a looming skills gap, how fast and how well are organisations and individuals upskilling to meet these demands? And, ultimately, are these skilling programmes inclusive of individuals struggling to adapt to change?\n\nAI and the value of human creativity\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for AI to take over repetitive and mundane tasks. This point has been made for years. It\u2019s another for AI, particularly gen AI, to take over high-value tasks such as content ideation, critical thinking and decision making, to the point of displacing human workers. These creative endeavours are now also under threat of AI automation.\n\nThe real value of human work in the age of AI will be in our ability to act as oversight and align AI use with ethical standards that protect the good of humanity.\n\nAugmenting work with AI allows workers to focus on the more meaningful and creative aspects of their jobs \u2013 but only to the extent that humans themselves understand their role as \u201cvalue creators\u201d. In other words, after we\u2019ve delegated mundane tasks to our robot counterparts, will the remainder of the work left to humans still be worth investing in?\n\nHuman creativity will become more valuable in a sea of AI-generated work. However, such creativity at work flourishes only if the right resources are directed to their development. Are we betting on the flourishing of human talent just as much as we are investing in AI development?",

        "text": "While the world is still largely divided on AI\u2014some see it as a threat to their careers while others embrace its transformative potential\u2014Singapore\u2019s majority is undoubtedly ready for an AI-driven future of work. For example, according to Indeed\u2019s Tomorrow\u2019s world: The workplace and workforce of the future report, at least 69% of Singapore\u2019s workforce feels confident about navigating a workplace that will be transformed by AI, whether it will happen in the next 18 months or over the next five years.\n\nThe Singapore government\u2019s numerous efforts to prepare the country for AI are a key driving force. One effort is the development of The Digital Enterprise Blueprint, a national-level strategy aimed at smart, calculated adoption of AI for business growth and cybersecurity.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the concerns others have about AI are baseless or irrelevant. If we look at real-life progress, generative AI (GenAI) is making a monumental mark across various industries alongside its growing integration with robotics. The capability is set to impact various job sectors, including office roles and blue-collar jobs. The fact that AI is fast-learning and continuously improving invokes fears in employees of being replaced at work.\n\nBut we do not need to worry about AI replacing us at work; AI can never replace our human qualities. This is why it is crucial to learn how to leverage your best qualities and hone your skills to continue showcasing your relevance alongside AI. Below are three key tips to make you indispensable in your organisation and use AI tactically instead of fearing it.\n\n1. Learn as much as you can about AI\n\nStay relevant by gaining proficiency in AI. This used to be an option, but now it is a necessary effort. Most of the time, we fear what we do not know, and this can no longer be an excuse. It is like the saying \u201cKeep your friends close and your enemy closer.\u201d Even if your current role is not tech-centric\u2014say, a marketer or HR person\u2014understanding AI, especially GenAI and machine learning, will give you an edge.\n\nThis is not an over-the-top move either. Based on NTUC LearningHub\u2019s Industry Insights Report 2024: Generative AI, 87% of business leaders have adopted GenAI technologies to some extent, and 80% agree that these skills will become essential for most roles. As companies actively seek talent skilled in GenAI\u201462% are already looking to fill such positions\u2014being proficient in these technologies can set you apart and protect your career. SkillsFuture Singapore is a national movement to provide Singaporeans with the opportunities to develop their fullest potential throughout life by offering valuable certifications in AI and machine learning (ML). Taking these courses can be a game-changer, as they not only help you gain new skills but also highlight your agility and help your resume stand out.\n\n2. Own your strengths and sharpen your wits\n\nSince automation is on the rise, the best way to assert yourself professionally is to continually grow to be the best at what you do. Be a master or a specialist in your field because your experiences will be your leverage. While AI can handle routine tasks, it cannot replicate creativity, strategic insight, or emotional intelligence. Make it a point to refine your skills and grab opportunities for professional growth, as they will help you stay indispensable.\n\n\u2018The transformation of the workplace by AI is not a cause for despair but an opportunity for growth.\u201d \u2013 Mohamed Marjook Hussain, Regional Technical Head for ANZ & APAC, ManageEngine\n\nNTUC LearningHub\u2019s report also revealed that 92% of business leaders anticipate that GenAI will redefine existing job roles. However, business leaders cannot solely rely on GenAI and deploy it in the hopes that it will be able to do what a field expert can. Sure, it can complete certain tasks quickly, but it cannot solve problems effectively or offer trustworthy insights. For employees, when you stay ahead in your field and integrate AI knowledge, you can demonstrate your value more effectively.\n\n3. See what else is out there\n\nThis advice might seem counterintuitive, but it is certainly not counterproductive. Explore the market and see what else matches your skillset\u2014you have nothing to lose. This does not mean you abandon the previous two tips and leave your current job. It simply means keeping your options open while investing in your own growth. After all, flexibility is a highly valued trait in job candidates. Identify all your skills and talent to consider other markets in which you can make your mark. Staying informed and adaptable will ensure you are not left behind as the job landscape evolves.\n\nREAD MORE: FutureSkills: What sort of workforce will you need in the age of GenAI?\n\nOf course, this is easier said than done given the tumultuous economy, but it is better to have a backup plan to ensure you\u2019re in control of whatever path you take next.\n\nVenturing into an AI-driven workplace with confidence\n\nTo be perfectly clear, the rise of AI is a difficult topic to navigate, but it should not be approached with fear. No matter how advanced AI is, it can never come close to what humans can do. Our thinking is unique, our drive for self-improvement is fiery, and our survival skills are not to be undermined.\n\nThe transformation of the workplace by AI is not a cause for despair but an opportunity for growth. So, sharpen your AI skills, hone your craft, keep an eye out for other opportunities, and march forward with confidence.\n\nAbout the author: Mohamed Marjook Hussain is Regional Technical Head for ANZ & APAC at ManageEngine.",

        "text": "New survey data from Pew Research Center shows only one-sixth (16%) of US workers are using AI in their jobs, and most of them worry about the impact the technology will have in the workplace.\n\nThe survey of 5,273 employed US adults taken last October suggests that workers have a lot of ambivalence about the future role AI will play in their jobs, with more than half (52%) more worried than hopeful about AI's impact. Almost a third, 32%, believe AI will lead to fewer job opportunities. That figure increases to 37% for those in lower-income jobs.\n\nSurprisingly, given the attention they generate, AI chatbots are not as popular as some might think. A majority, 55%, say they don't use AI chatbots at all or use them rarely. Only one in 10 workers use AI chatbots every day or a few times a week.\n\nThe Pew data seems counter to businesses' vast investments in AI, with some estimates putting the figure at $1 trillion across industries. Companies including Apple, Google, OpenAI and Meta have rushed to position themselves as leaders in the AI space, debuting large-language AI models such as ChatGPT and Gemini that they hope people will adopt for work and everyday tasks. The investments AI-focused companies have made and the energy and data requirements for AI have recently been called into question with the emergence of cheaper, more efficient models such as China's DeepSeek.\n\nBut despite all the money and hype around AI, Pew's findings were not particularly surprising to some who are studying the impact of the technology, including Winnie Kroculick and Antara Dutta, the co-authors of Own Your Future \u2013 AI for All, which will be published in April.\n\nKroculick and Dutta, who both have worked in the financial industry, say Pew's findings align with what they discovered researching their book.\n\n\"Technology change and disruption patterns typically create two distinct outcomes: fear and eager anticipation. AI is following these typical patterns, although somewhat accelerated,\" Kroculick told CNET. \"Those who are eager to use AI are likely the traditional early adopters and they embrace disruption and can see AI's value in transforming and improving the way organizations operate. On the other hand, the fearful are at risk of being left behind, unless they adapt and ultimately embrace the changing technology.\"\n\nRead more: Here Are 5 Jobs AI Will Create \u2014 and 5 Roles AI Will Change\n\nDutta added that there's a schism between company leaders, who see AI as improving efficiency, reducing costs, and driving innovation, and employees, who may see AI as a threat to their job security.\n\nEmployees, Dutta said, \"need to proactively examine their role and functions and assess where AI can solve repetitive tasks. While this may be scary for the employee, being proactive in assessing their own role will help them identify new opportunities and ultimately own their future in the workplace.\"\n\nEarly AI adopters tend to be younger, Kroculick said. She advises older users and anyone who wants to remain employed to start adopting it. \"Being proactive is the way forward or you will risk being left behind,\" she said.",

        "text": "\u2190 Blog home\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) released a comprehensive set of Principles and Best Practices for employers implementing artificial intelligence (AI) systems in the workplace. This guidance, part of President Biden\u2019s Executive Order on AI, aims to protect workers\u2019 rights and well-being while harnessing AI\u2019s potential benefits.\n\nThe DOL\u2019s guidance emphasizes the importance of worker empowerment, ethical AI development, transparency, and responsible data use. \u201cThese Best Practices provide a roadmap for responsible AI in the workplace, helping businesses harness these technologies while proactively supporting and valuing their workers,\u201d said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su.\n\nJump to \u2193\n\nThe DOL\u2019s eight principles\n\nThe eight principles provide a framework for employers to implement AI systems that complement rather than replace workers, protect labor rights, and improve job quality. Various aspects of AI implementation are covered in the Best Practices, from governance and oversight to supporting workers affected by AI-driven transitions.\n\n1. Centering Worker Empowerment\n\nEmployers should involve workers and their representatives in the design, development, and deployment of AI systems. When workers are unionized, employers should bargain in good faith regarding AI and electronic monitoring use.\n\n2. Ethical Development\n\nAI developers should establish ethical standards and review processes to ensure AI systems protect workers\u2019 rights, mitigate risks, and meet performance requirements. They should conduct impact assessments, design systems for human oversight, ensure good quality jobs for data reviewers, and create AI that produces understandable outcomes for non-technical users.\n\n3. Establishing AI Governance and Oversight\n\nOrganizations should create governance structures accountable to leadership for AI system implementation. Employers should provide appropriate AI training to a broad range of employees. Human oversight is crucial for significant employment decisions influenced by AI.\n\n4. Ensuring Transparency\n\nEmployers should provide advance notice and disclosure about worker-impacting AI systems. Workers should be informed about data collection and its purpose in AI systems. Procedures should be in place for workers to request, view, and correct their data used in employment decisions.\n\n5. Protecting Labor and Employment Rights\n\nAI systems should not undermine workers\u2019 right to organize or violate health, safety, wage, and anti-discrimination protections. Employers must comply with existing labor laws and regulations when using AI.\n\n6. Using AI to Enable Workers\n\nAI should be implemented to assist and complement workers, improving job quality. Employers should consider piloting AI systems before broad deployment and minimize invasive electronic monitoring.\n\n7. Supporting Workers Impacted by AI\n\nEmployers should provide training opportunities for workers to use AI systems. Retraining and reallocation of workers displaced by AI should be prioritized when feasible.\n\n8. Responsible Use of Worker Data\n\nData collection should be limited to legitimate business purposes and protected from threats. Employers should secure worker consent before sharing data outside the organization.\n\nImplementing AI Responsibly\n\nBradford J. Kelley, a Shareholder at Littler, stressed the importance of implementing safeguards that align with the DOL\u2019s Principles and Best Practices as employers consider adopting AI technologies.\n\n\u201cEmphasis should be placed on actively engaging with employees about AI usage, conducting audits of AI systems used in employment decisions, assessing how AI systems will enhance employee well-being, and minimizing potential negative impacts on the workforce,\u201d he said.\n\nKelley, who was formally a senior policy advisor at the DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD), noted that \u201c[t]he DOL guidance is flexible and organizations should adjust the principles based on their particular needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cA proactive approach to AI in the workplace can help employers effectively navigate the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape,\u201d he added, stressing the need to stay ahead of potential legal and ethical challenges associated with AI implementation.\n\nState legislation governing AI\n\nIn May 2024, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed legislation into law to regulate employers\u2019 use of AI for consequential decisions, including employment or an employment opportunity, with reservations and called for improvements to it before implementation, urging federal legislation to preempt the state bill. The bill takes effect on February 1, 2026.\n\nIn August 2024, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker signed legislation into law that amends the state\u2019s Human Rights Act to include new provisions related to AI in employment practices. Effective January 1, 2026, employers will be prohibited from using AI in ways that discriminate against protected classes or use zip codes as a proxy for protected classes in various employment decisions. Employers will also be required to notify employees when AI is being used for these purposes.\n\nOther states may follow with similar measures to regulate the use of AI in the workplace. The California Civil Rights Council, for example, proposed regulations in May 2024 that would clarify how existing anti-discrimination laws apply to the use of AI, algorithms, and other automated tools in employment practices.",

        "text": "AI and Today\u2019s Workplace: A New Frontier\n\nAs the use of artificial intelligence (AI) proliferates in and outside the workplace, there are growing fears among the workforce that AI may take over human jobs.\n\nAI\u2019s application in everyday workflows may be new, but it has been in use behind the scenes more and earlier than we realise. AI is found not only in applications and digital services but has also become a vital component in the office, through autocorrect features in word processors, spam filtering on email platforms, and even equipment software.\n\nAI\u2019s integration into the workplace was further accelerated by the 2020 pandemic, helping to not only raise productivity and transform the way we work, but also revolutionise how we optimise and personalise customer experience.\n\nHow AI is Changing the Way We Work\n\nArtificial Intelligence has the power to disrupt and transform the way we work and has already cemented itself in industries such as Banking and Finance. Here\u2019s how AI is empowering today\u2019s digital workplace:\n\nAI in Finance\n\nIn an industry like Banking and Finance where accuracy is everything, AI has become an indispensable part of the workplace.\n\nAI has enabled automation, increasing efficiency and accuracy, and lowering costs by replacing manual paper-based processes. Many companies have started automating their accounts payable (AP) process. Invoices are now scanned through OCR (optical character recognition), with AI analysing their contents and automating the data management processes thereafter.\n\nAI has largely taken over tedious and manual processes once assigned to human employees and have made AP processing faster, easier, and more accurate. With AI-driven data capture, touchless processing, automated sorting, and electronic workflow capabilities, workers can focus on higher value tasks such as reviewing and approving the processes, and managing the business\u2019 cash flow.\n\nAI in Maintenance Support\n\nAI can support operational excellence by contributing toward predictive maintenance, improved diagnostics and fault detection, and automated reports to support specialists who can then take necessary action. This can help to accelerate resolution response time of technical support staff.\n\nAI can also make it possible for companies to offer round-the-clock tech support with remote monitoring and troubleshooting, prescriptive maintenance recommendations, providing meaningful answers, enhanced and improved over time by machine learning.\n\nAI for Print Service Providers\n\nAI technologies have transformed the production print industry, with recommendations on colour matching, paper alignment, document layouts, and standardised pre-press and print processes.\n\nAI is also used to scan for image quality and can make corrections on effects such as backlit exposure and problems with contrast. Yet this does not downplay the human aspect to print management, as workers can now focus on quality control optimisation and business skills development.\n\nAI for brand owners\n\nThe marketing industry has seen exponential growth in customisation and personalisation of collaterals based on customer data. Variable data and versioning techniques are now regarded as the norm. AI manages massive amounts of information from an ever-growing pool of customers and data, allowing business owners to reach highly targeted customer segments with uniquely relevant marketing messages, at the best time, via the best channel for the respective audience.\n\nAI and the Future of Work: A Winning Formula\n\nMany businesses are already reaping the benefits of AI. Several industries have enjoyed large leaps in performance and outputs since training their workforce to use AI and leverage the technology for content generation, predictive analytics, workflow automation, and more.\n\nWorkplaces that have successfully integrated AI technologies are set to see increased efficiency, improved customer retention, and greater customer satisfaction. With the demand for automation increasing, AI will continue to allow businesses to scale production, grow and deliver more value using less time and fewer resources. While AI takes over certain aspects of a human role, it also provides new opportunities to develop other skills.\n\nUnlock your business potential with AI\n\nFUJIFILM Business Innovation Singapore can partner you in your AI-driven Digital Transformation (DX) journey from configuring your AI-integrated Digital Workplace to implementing and managing AI-powered Data Management and Workflow Automation technologies.\n\nContact us to find out more!\n\nLearn More Contact Us",

        "text": "Workday has published a new global study that positions artificial intelligence (AI) as a catalyst for a skills revolution in the workplace rather than a threat to human jobs.\n\nThe research, titled \"Elevating Human Potential: The AI Skills Revolution,\" shows that uniquely human traits such as empathy and ethical decision-making will become increasingly valuable in an AI-driven economy. The study, which surveyed 2,500 full-time workers across 22 countries, highlights that as AI automates routine tasks, it simultaneously elevates the importance of human-centric skills.\n\nIn Singapore, workers appear to be particularly advanced in their use of AI. A significant majority, 95%, report that AI enables them to concentrate on higher-level responsibilities, compared to the global average of 93%. Moreover, 94% of Singapore respondents show confidence in using AI for complex work. They are also more positive about AI's impact on human creativity, with 87% of participants sharing this view against a global average of 83%.\n\nJim Stratton, Chief Technology Officer at Workday, remarked, \"The conversation around AI often focuses on fear and job loss, but we see it as an incredible opportunity. By embracing AI for good, we can elevate what makes us uniquely human \u2013 our creativity, our empathy, our ability to connect \u2013 and build a workplace where these skills drive success. Our research shows that workers are ready to embrace this possibility as reality.\"\n\nThe study also identifies a divergence in perspective between employees and leaders regarding the necessity for human connection in an AI-augmented workplace. While 82% of employees see an increasing need for human interaction, only 65% of managers agree. The report suggests that fostering human connections is vital as AI becomes more prevalent in the work environment.\n\nSadie Bell, Vice President of People Systems at HPE, commented, \"AI is driving us towards a future where we can harness our innate human skills to connect, create, and innovate. This isn't just about efficiency and problem-solving; it's about unlocking our potential to build a future that prioritizes skills like empathy, ingenuity, and our shared humanity.\"\n\nThe research highlights that active AI users generally have a positive outlook on its benefits, with 92% of employees and 95% of leaders agreeing that AI allows them to focus on more strategic tasks. This sentiment showcases the potential of AI to transform workplaces by facilitating innovative and meaningful collaborations.\n\nEthical decision-making, relationship building, and conflict resolution are amongst the skills perceived as least likely to be supplanted by AI but are considered the most crucial for workplace success. The emphasis on these skills indicates their growing significance in the face of increasing AI adoption.\n\nJennie Rogerson, Global Head of People at Canva, stated, \"In 2025, AI will play an important role in unlocking efficiencies in how People teams operate, but it won't replace the essential human elements, like empathy, communication and relationship building.\"\n\nMoreover, 90% of workers agree that AI can enhance organisational transparency and accountability. Despite societal concerns over AI affecting trust in the workplace, this widespread confidence suggests an optimistic future for AI's role in business environments.\n\nA key aspect revealed by the study is the need for substantial collaboration across sectors to ensure that AI is applied responsibly and benefits all stakeholders. This responsibility is shared between the technology sector, individual organisations, and governments.\n\nThe study concludes that embracing AI offers an opportunity to elevate human potential and that fostering the development of uniquely human skills will be imperative for future success in an AI-driven world. The shared commitment to responsible AI use represents a collective step towards a more integrated and progressive future.",

        "text": "CXOtoday has engaged in an exclusive interview with Dr. Antarpreet Singh, Director (Academics), WILL Education\n\nWhat new roles could arise with the increased use of AI technology at the workplace?\n\nIn today\u2019s AI age, the narrative has completely shifted from jobs per se to skills within a job. That skill set within each job must be aligned to the changing needs of work that has a key focus to navigate complexity, fluidity, and turbulence. The new age roles will revolve around the data-driven work culture and automation of routine processes through the use of conventional discriminative AI models (e.g., machine learning-based automated profiles screening at the first level for the talent acquisition ecosystem).\n\nWhat skills would be prioritized in a work environment dominated by AI?\n\nThe new-age skills in AI-led workplaces will have a sharper focus around analytics that covers all four stages: descriptive (statistical analysis), diagnostic (root cause analysis), predictive (forecasting in a non-linear fashion as to what could happen with a greater probability), and prescriptive (providing critical prescriptions to decision-makers that reduce the chances of poor decisions and thus mitigate the risk of losing customers as well as hedge the organization against poor financial decisions).\n\nWhat should educational institutions do to ensure that students are ready to enter the job market driven by AI?\n\nThere is a misconception that only data science students should learn about analytics. The educational institutes must keep \u2018design thinking\u2019 principles at the center stage while preparing curriculum for various streams. One of the key design elements for these streams is to help students (as functional users) get a good understanding of using various AI tools from the perspective of data analytics. Not every student aspires to choose analytics as a core discipline. At the same time, each student must have an end-to-end view of using both discriminative and generative AI as a way of life.\n\nIn what way can workers protect their careers from AI technology disruption?\n\nIt is very important for workers to understand that they must acquire transformative competencies that focus on \u2018Future Readiness\u2019. We should also stop living in a self-denial mode that AI would only disrupt technological space. The disruption being caused by AI in every field has a profound impact on each and every workplace. The only answer to mitigating the risk of AI disruptions is to prepare well and equip yourself with the future skills. As per the World Economic Forum, the future skills can be organized around 3 pillars \u2013 Learning & Innovation, Leadership & Life management, and Digital & AI. Everyone working in industry and other fields must embrace these future skills.\n\nWhat is the potential impact of advanced Generative AI on human creativity and emotional intelligence?\n\nThere is a lot of debate on this aspect, and experts have mixed views. However, it would be safe to advocate that human creativity and ingenuity must be preserved at all costs. AI in whatever form (discriminative or generative) must not replace human creativity and emotions. These must remain in the human domain only. Several experts have coined the term \u2018Augmented Intelligence\u2019 that focuses on the augmentation of human creativity with the computing and analytical power of AI.\n\nIs there a potential for AI to remove the need for more traditional technical skills, or will there be a greater need for AI proficiency?\n\nThis is a natural phenomenon that gained momentum with the advent of Industry 4.0 in the early 90s in the previous century. The technical advancement leads to the displacement of traditional skills. The only difference between Industry 4.0 and what has lately come to be known as Industry 5.0 is the acceleration in adoption of AI-led technologies. The pace of adoption is phenomenal. This makes the traditional digital technologies that came to be known as \u2018enterprise software\u2019 from an industry standpoint redundant, as software has become learnable. For AI to be proficient, it\u2019s important that the algorithms must be trained regularly (exactly the way humans learn continuously) or made to learn by themselves. The continuous learning of algorithms is the key to having a proficient AI at a workplace.\n\nIn what ways will businesses have to change their workforce structure to make the best use of AI?\n\nFuture readiness of workplaces will require a great deal of attention on aligning the workplace structures in line with harmonious human-AI collaboration. That could mean deskilling of certain processes within jobs as well as complete deskilling of certain routine jobs that can be handled by AI with greater efficiency and at a lower cost. The alignment of workplace structures to facilitate harmonious adoption of AI has to be done very skillfully by the leaders, as selective deskilling of processes and jobs improves efficiency and leads to cost optimization. At the same time, it runs the risk of inducing what\u2019s termed as \u201cAI-induced anxiety\u2019 that could lower the morale of the workforce. The adoption of AI in a workplace must be harmonious and not at the cost of employees in an organization. We also need to understand that the \u2018selective deskilling\u2019 may cause some rearrangements as some employees may move to roles that require more creativity and ingenuity.",

        "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s rollback of basic guardrails for artificial intelligence leaves US workers \u201cat real risk\u201d, labor experts have warned.\n\nProtections introduced under Joe Biden to ensure the safe, secure and trustworthy development and use of AI were swiftly repealed by the Trump administration \u2013 as top executives outlined sweeping plans to overhaul the labor force.\n\nToday\u2019s CEOs are likely the last to \u201cmanage a workforce of only human beings\u201d, Salesforce boss Marc Benioff claimed at Davos. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, meanwhile told podcaster Joe Rogan that its AI will \u201cprobably\u201d be able to act as \u201ca sort of midlevel engineer\u201d as soon as this year.\n\n\u201cWorkers are at a relatively weak point,\u201d said top labor scholar David Madland, who argued the AI protection rollbacks under Trump \u201cmade it even more so that workers are at the whims of their employers on how AI is deployed\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be at real risk of having their jobs degraded in many different kinds of ways,\u201d said Madland, a senior fellow and senior adviser to the American Worker Project at Center for American Progress. \u201cThe Biden administration rules provided very modest \u2013 only very modest \u2013 protections, but they were better than nothing.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump the US government is \u201cpromoting and encouraging AI innovation to ensure America remains the leader in this cutting edge technology\u201d, Victoria LaCivita, White House office of science and technology policy Sspokesperson, said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump administration is committed to ensuring the continued American leadership in AI.\u201d\n\nAmong the guidelines removed by the Trump administration were directives issued by the US Department of Labor to ensure employers create and implement AI in the workplace without diminishing job quality or violating workers\u2019 rights. Significant cuts are also expected at the US AI Safety Institute, as part of Trump\u2019s efforts to cull the federal workforce.\n\n\u201cIt strips out consideration of civil rights, job quality and the impact on workers,\u201d said Josh Boxerman, government affairs manager for the National Employment Law Project.\n\nHe pointed to concerns about the degrading quality of jobs, rather than their displacement. AI is increasingly being used to manage workers, from impacts on surveillance and productivity pressures on Amazon warehouse workers, algorithm management of ride share drivers with gig apps such as Uber and Lyft, and recent growing trends of gig work in the healthcare industry, including algorithms used to mass deny health insurance claims and apps using AI to undercut pay and working conditions for nurses.\n\n\u201cThe story of displacement right now is not just workers being replaced by robots or work being automated away, but also workers being replaced or jobs being replaced by jobs of lower quality,\u201d said Boxerman. Trump, he noted, won back the presidency last year after successfully seeking support from the working class.\n\nMany of the tech companies at the heart of the AI boom, including Meta, Google and Amazon, lined up to support Trump\u2019s inauguration with donations. The OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman personally donated $1m.\n\nRecent polling by Pew Research found 52% of US workers are worried about the future impacts of AI in the workplace, with 32% expecting it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of strong guardrails, those tools are creating real-world harms when companies and government agencies use them to help decide who gets a job, who gets a loan, who goes to jail, and a host of other sensitive decisions,\u201d wrote attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union on Trump\u2019s AI executive orders.\n\nThe use of AI, and its impact on workers, was front on mind when the Writers Guild of America and actors represented by Sag-Aftra secured their 2023 contracts.\n\nJohn Rogers, a screenwriter and board member with the Writers Guild of America West, said: \u201cThe general concern is always that corporations will attempt to maximize the profits at the expense of the workers. AI is the dream of capital everywhere, which is it would be nice to have income with no workers. So we always have to be aware of that.\u201d\n\nAs AI progresses and its use expands, there are ongoing concerns about writers\u2019 work being stolen to develop the technology, he said. \u201cRight now, there is no consequence for companies that are valued at billions of dollars being valued only because they stole other people\u2019s work,\u201d added Rogers.\n\n\u201cThere are arguments to be made that when a new technology comes along that makes things better or more efficient, you should embrace it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make things better. It doesn\u2019t do things more efficient. It doesn\u2019t make things cheaper. The consumers don\u2019t want AI slop. The creators don\u2019t want their stuff sold for AI.\n\n\u201cThe only people who want AI are the people making AI, who need people to invest billions of dollars in it. And right now, not just the creators, but also the consumers, are suffering from it.\u201d\n\nThe labor department was contacted for comment.",

        "text": "It could be argued that there is a bit of a don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know phenomenon surrounding AI, with those understanding AI appearing to be biggest proponents of its impact on the workplace.\n\nIn its 2023 report, The skills gap: What employers want from business school graduates, QS found that perceptions of AI\u2019s impact on the workplace was significantly influenced by how familiar the employer is with the technology. A notable 37% of employers who were extremely familiar with AI anticipated that it would bring about a substantial transformational change in their workplaces within a year. By contrast, 31% of employers not well-acquainted with AI believed its impact will be minimal.\n\nA year on and the continuing surge in demand for AI appears to have borne out the predictions of those \u2018in the know\u2019. According to Microsoft and LinkedIn\u2019s 2024 Work Trend Index, 71% of leaders now prefer to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills over a more experienced candidate without those skills. Employers are prioritising these skills in new hires. Here at GradLink, a careers site for international students, we have seen an increase in AI as a keyword used by global employers when searching our CV database.\n\nAnd, rather than being a fad, everything is pointing to this being the long-haul direction of travel. The IMF, for example, recently estimated that almost 40% of jobs will be impacted by AI going forward. According to data from Salesforce, just one in 10 workers globally have the necessary AI skills. It would certainly appear that, as the QS Gen AI Employer Pulse Survey states, employers are generally accepting that AI is here to stay.\n\nFor international students, the need for AI skills can be even more urgent\n\nThe surging impact of AI will inevitably influence the skills graduates need for the changing workplace. QS\u2019s survey, which had responses from over 1,000 employers, found that they are prioritising skills relating to the ability to utilise AI. These include problem-solving to deal with the complex information AI generates; quantitative skills to analyse and interpret vast amounts of data; and creativity to envisage novel applications and strategies for AI.\n\nThe report quotes Philip Heavilin of William and Mary University in the US, who says: \u201cAs AI continues to evolve and take on more transactional workplace tasks, the need for employees to possess creativity, critical thinking, resiliency, and a capacity to work well with others will only continue to grow in importance as these are skills yet to be replaced by machine learning.\u201d\n\nFor international students, the need for AI skills can be even more urgent. Many emerging economies are experiencing growing technology industries, but unfortunately the professional skill-sets are not there to match.\n\nGaining exposure to these technologies in countries with strong digital ecosystems \u2013 such as the UK \u2013 could help international students to develop the AI skills yearned for by employers in their home country. However, in order for international students to truly thrive in this respect, universities must be agile and supportive enough to address the \u2018digital shock\u2019 they can often experience at the outset of their studies.\n\nIf international students are to be truly valuable to employers in the new workplace, universities must ensure they are equipped with the intellectual dexterity to harness AI\u2019s potential effectively\n\nAnd it\u2019s not simply about ensuring students are familiar with AI technologies. If international students are to be truly valuable to employers in the new workplace, universities must ensure they are equipped with the intellectual dexterity to harness AI\u2019s potential effectively. Unfortunately, the QS report points to the gap widening between what\u2019s taught in business schools and the real-world demands of the industry.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though students aren\u2019t feeling the AI gap in their skills. The recent Employability Report by Cengage Group of 1,000 U.S. employers and 974 recent graduates, found that 70% of graduates believe basic generative AI training needs to be integrated into their courses, and 55% felt their degree programs did not adequately prepare them to use new technology tools in the workforce.\n\nAnd perhaps counter-intuitively, it\u2019s the youngest of these graduates surveyed, described as the \u2018Gen-Zers\u2019 \u2013 the ones who might be assumed to be most confident in terms of adapting to new technologies \u2013 who are most likely to feel this way (61%). But maybe that\u2019s the point: they know what they don\u2019t know.",

        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a general-purpose technology is poised to transform work across a variety of industries and job roles. Previous waves of technological change mainly led to job displacement and wage pressures for bluecollar workers while enhancing productivity and wages for white-collar workers. In contrast, AI\u2019s impact could be more pervasive across all occupational categories, including knowledge workers and those with advanced education. Recent studies indicate that up to 80 percent of U.S. workers might have at least 10 percent of their work activities affected by large language models, with approximately 19 percent of workers potentially seeing half or more of their work activities impacted.\n\nThe nature of this transformation depends largely on two factors: the degree to which AI can perform or enhance an occupation\u2019s core tasks, and whether AI serves as a substitute for or complement to human workers. Occupations with high AI exposure but low complementarity face the greatest risk of disruption, highlighting the need for comprehensive retraining and upskilling initiatives. This situation is particularly critical given that technical skills now become outdated in less than five years, on average.\n\nAnalysis of future workforce demands reveals the following trend: while technical skills remain important, accounting for about 27 percent of in-demand skills, the majority of crucial skills are nontechnical. Foundational skills (such as mathematics and active learning), social skills (including social perceptiveness and negotiation), and thinking skills (such as complex problem-solving and critical thinking) together make up nearly 58 percent of skills needed in growing occupations. This underscores the importance of developing a well-rounded workforce capable of adapting to technological change while maintaining strong interpersonal and analytical capabilities.\n\nThe potentially far-reaching impact of AI across occupations, coupled with the likely accelerating pace of skill obsolescence, points to an increasing need for continuous retraining and upskilling opportunities throughout workers\u2019 careers. This shifting landscape demands a critical examination of current workforce development infrastructure and its capacity to meet these emerging challenges at scale. Understanding which elements of the existing system can be effectively expanded and which barriers need to be addressed becomes crucial for developing responsive and resilient workforce training solutions.\n\nCommunity colleges emerge as pivotal institutions in addressing these challenges, particularly when integrated into robust regional ecosystems that include employers and intermediaries. Recent federal initiatives, including $265 million in Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grants since 2021, demonstrate recognition of community colleges\u2019 crucial role. Successful workforce development programs often combine traditional education with work-based learning opportunities, such as registered apprenticeships and career technical education (CTE). Several states have already begun implementing AI-specific CTE programs to prepare students for the evolving technical workforce.\n\nHowever, significant challenges persist in the current workforce development landscape. These include fragmented training systems, insufficient public funding, regulatory disincentives favoring capital investment over labor, and difficulties in scaling successful programs.\n\nWhile AI may be a source of workplace disruption requiring enhanced workforce training efforts, it also presents opportunities to address some of these systemic challenges in workforce development. The technology\u2019s capabilities could help scale effective training solutions and make them more accessible and affordable, potentially bridging gaps in the current system.\n\nSpecifically, these capabilities enable personalized learning experiences, rapid content delivery, and increased accessibility. AI tools can provide customized learning paths, instant feedback, and career guidance. However, implementation must be approached cautiously. Concerns include the potential erosion of interpersonal skills, trust and privacy issues, and the risk of exacerbating existing inequalities through algorithmic bias and unequal access. Research indicates that while AI tools can enhance productivity, overreliance on these tools may hinder genuine skill development and learning.\n\nMoving forward, successful workforce development will require a multifaceted approach: strengthening community college programs, expanding alternative career pathways, incorporating AI literacy into training initiatives, and ensuring equitable access to technology-enabled learning opportunities. This should be accompanied by careful consideration of how AI tools are integrated into training programs to maximize benefits while mitigating risks to skill development and learning outcomes. Further research is needed to understand how successful training solutions can be scaled across diverse regions and how AI training tools can be effectively deployed to serve diverse populations while supporting genuine skill development and learning.",

There is no denying the obstacles ahead, but this latest research aims to close the gap and steer workers toward a more informed and prepared future. Over the next five years, employees will see nearly 40% of their current skills become outdated or radically reshaped according to the report. Those who adapt to using AI, rather than denying its presence, will have the upper hand in the years ahead. Tech-related expertise, creative problem-solving and a dedication to learning will be more crucial than ever.\n\nReskilling is essential to future-proofing careers\n\nOver the next few years, workplaces will grapple with widening skills gaps, with 63% of employers anticipating this as a major barrier between 2025 and 2030. In response, 85% of employers are prioritizing upskilling, while 40% plan to reduce staff as skills become outdated, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nEach strategy will depend on the specific goals and organizational structure of each company, and no single playbook will work for everyone. Reskilling is set to top the agenda, but companies must first pinpoint the skills they need most. A clear skills framework can help businesses achieve this and ensure as seamless a transition as possible.\n\nCommunication is also key as AI reshapes the workplace. An open dialogue about its utilization builds trust and clarifies where AI can add value. Critical thinking skills will also remain crucial\u2014AI isn\u2019t perfect, and employees must speak up if it hinders progress.\n\nGenerative AI, in particular, unlocks a world of possibilities, enabling us to shift away from time-consuming or monotonous tasks. It stands as one of the many potential benefits of the era ahead. From drafting emails to handling tedious data gathering, AI will make these tasks easier, or even obsolete, freeing us up to focus on more meaningful work. As a consequence, knowledge workers may find themselves spending more time in creative and leadership roles.\n\nWhich roles will be most affected by AI integration?\n\nAI automation is driving fears of widespread layoffs, with U.S. hiring announcements at the lowest since 2015. The trend is expected to continue into the new year, particularly in sectors like transportation, manufacturing and education. A September report by Challenger, Gray and Christmas found that transportation companies announced 25,263 job cuts, education saw a 220% increase in layoffs compared to the previous year and manufacturing faced 19,794 job losses in 2024. In the near future, blue-collar jobs will likely be the first to bear the brunt of AI automation. However, even roles that seem secure today may not be immune.\n\nRoles that remain essential and cannot be replaced are expected to gain value. The World Economic Forum report reveals that, by 2030, over half of employers (52%) plan to boost their wage allocation in remaining roles, reflecting a rising demand, particularly for skilled workers over the next decade.\n\nIt\u2019s not just executives at the top who are grappling with how to manage the next era of AI integration. Employees are also reassessing their roles, functions and responsibilities, questioning the value of their contributions as technology advances. A 2024 study from the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Liberty Street Economics blog indicated that 4 in 10 Americans worry generative AI could diminish the number of available jobs.\n\nCould AI erase the need for human labor?\n\nSome executives are rejecting the idea of AI-human collaboration entirely, and placing all their bets on AI alone. Last month, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski revealed he hadn\u2019t hired anyone in a year due to his company embracing AI, suggesting that all internal roles could be handled by machines. This week, he doubled down on his stance via X, claiming even his own position might eventually become redundant.\n\nArtificial intelligence holds both promise and peril, with many unknowns still in the mix. What\u2019s undeniable is that those who can adapt and work alongside AI will be best positioned for the future. But for others, the challenge will be much harder, and in the worst-case scenarios, millions of people might be left rethinking their entire career trajectory.\n\nPhoto by Stokkete/Shutterstock",

A clear skills framework can help businesses achieve this and ensure as seamless a transition as possible.\n\nCommunication is also key as AI reshapes the workplace. An open dialogue about its utilization builds trust and clarifies where AI can add value. Critical thinking skills will also remain crucial\u2014AI isn\u2019t perfect, and employees must speak up if it hinders progress.\n\nGenerative AI, in particular, unlocks a world of possibilities, enabling us to shift away from time-consuming or monotonous tasks. It stands as one of the many potential benefits of the era ahead. From drafting emails to handling tedious data gathering, AI will make these tasks easier, or even obsolete, freeing us up to focus on more meaningful work. As a consequence, knowledge workers may find themselves spending more time in creative and leadership roles.\n\nWhich roles will be most affected by AI integration?\n\nAI automation is driving fears of widespread layoffs, with U.S. hiring announcements at the lowest since 2015. The trend is expected to continue into the new year, particularly in sectors like transportation, manufacturing and education. A September report by Challenger, Gray and Christmas found that transportation companies announced 25,263 job cuts, education saw a 220% increase in layoffs compared to the previous year and manufacturing faced 19,794 job losses in 2024. In the near future, blue-collar jobs will likely be the first to bear the brunt of AI automation. However, even roles that seem secure today may not be immune.\n\nRoles that remain essential and cannot be replaced are expected to gain value. The World Economic Forum report reveals that, by 2030, over half of employers (52%) plan to boost their wage allocation in remaining roles, reflecting a rising demand, particularly for skilled workers over the next decade.\n\nIt\u2019s not just executives at the top who are grappling with how to manage the next era of AI integration. Employees are also reassessing their roles, functions and responsibilities, questioning the value of their contributions as technology advances. A 2024 study from the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Liberty Street Economics blog indicated that 4 in 10 Americans worry generative AI could diminish the number of available jobs.\n\nCould AI erase the need for human labor?\n\nSome executives are rejecting the idea of AI-human collaboration entirely, and placing all their bets on AI alone. Last month, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski revealed he hadn\u2019t hired anyone in a year due to his company embracing AI, suggesting that all internal roles could be handled by machines. This week, he doubled down on his stance via X, claiming even his own position might eventually become redundant.\n\nArtificial intelligence holds both promise and peril, with many unknowns still in the mix. What\u2019s undeniable is that those who can adapt and work alongside AI will be best positioned for the future. But for others, the challenge will be much harder, and in the worst-case scenarios, millions of people might be left rethinking their entire career trajectory.\n\nPhoto by Stokkete/Shutterstock",

        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a general-purpose technology is poised to transform work across a variety of industries and job roles. Previous waves of technological change mainly led to job displacement and wage pressures for bluecollar workers while enhancing productivity and wages for white-collar workers. In contrast, AI\u2019s impact could be more pervasive across all occupational categories, including knowledge workers and those with advanced education. Recent studies indicate that up to 80 percent of U.S. workers might have at least 10 percent of their work activities affected by large language models, with approximately 19 percent of workers potentially seeing half or more of their work activities impacted.\n\nThe nature of this transformation depends largely on two factors: the degree to which AI can perform or enhance an occupation\u2019s core tasks, and whether AI serves as a substitute for or complement to human workers. Occupations with high AI exposure but low complementarity face the greatest risk of disruption, highlighting the need for comprehensive retraining and upskilling initiatives. This situation is particularly critical given that technical skills now become outdated in less than five years, on average.\n\nAnalysis of future workforce demands reveals the following trend: while technical skills remain important, accounting for about 27 percent of in-demand skills, the majority of crucial skills are nontechnical. Foundational skills (such as mathematics and active learning), social skills (including social perceptiveness and negotiation), and thinking skills (such as complex problem-solving and critical thinking) together make up nearly 58 percent of skills needed in growing occupations. This underscores the importance of developing a well-rounded workforce capable of adapting to technological change while maintaining strong interpersonal and analytical capabilities.\n\nThe potentially far-reaching impact of AI across occupations, coupled with the likely accelerating pace of skill obsolescence, points to an increasing need for continuous retraining and upskilling opportunities throughout workers\u2019 careers. This shifting landscape demands a critical examination of current workforce development infrastructure and its capacity to meet these emerging challenges at scale. Understanding which elements of the existing system can be effectively expanded and which barriers need to be addressed becomes crucial for developing responsive and resilient workforce training solutions.\n\nCommunity colleges emerge as pivotal institutions in addressing these challenges, particularly when integrated into robust regional ecosystems that include employers and intermediaries. Recent federal initiatives, including $265 million in Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grants since 2021, demonstrate recognition of community colleges\u2019 crucial role. Successful workforce development programs often combine traditional education with work-based learning opportunities, such as registered apprenticeships and career technical education (CTE). Several states have already begun implementing AI-specific CTE programs to prepare students for the evolving technical workforce.\n\nHowever, significant challenges persist in the current workforce development landscape. These include fragmented training systems, insufficient public funding, regulatory disincentives favoring capital investment over labor, and difficulties in scaling successful programs.\n\nWhile AI may be a source of workplace disruption requiring enhanced workforce training efforts, it also presents opportunities to address some of these systemic challenges in workforce development. The technology\u2019s capabilities could help scale effective training solutions and make them more accessible and affordable, potentially bridging gaps in the current system.\n\nSpecifically, these capabilities enable personalized learning experiences, rapid content delivery, and increased accessibility. AI tools can provide customized learning paths, instant feedback, and career guidance. However, implementation must be approached cautiously. Concerns include the potential erosion of interpersonal skills, trust and privacy issues, and the risk of exacerbating existing inequalities through algorithmic bias and unequal access. Research indicates that while AI tools can enhance productivity, overreliance on these tools may hinder genuine skill development and learning.\n\nMoving forward, successful workforce development will require a multifaceted approach: strengthening community college programs, expanding alternative career pathways, incorporating AI literacy into training initiatives, and ensuring equitable access to technology-enabled learning opportunities. This should be accompanied by careful consideration of how AI tools are integrated into training programs to maximize benefits while mitigating risks to skill development and learning outcomes. Further research is needed to understand how successful training solutions can be scaled across diverse regions and how AI training tools can be effectively deployed to serve diverse populations while supporting genuine skill development and learning.",

        "text": "As artificial intelligence rewires industries and whispers of rising unemployment spread, many workers find themselves walking a tightrope of job insecurity.\n\nAI is indeed a double-edged sword \u2013 one that can swing as either a job eliminator or a powerful ally for enhanced productivity. Yet, for those who embrace it, AI offers an exciting horizon of personal and professional growth.\n\nThe pace of AI development, especially following the rapid rise of tools like ChatGPT in 2023, means that workers and leaders alike must evolve in tandem with these technologies to keep their competitive edge sharp. From marketing to customer service to content creation, AI is transforming the playing field, altering how daily tasks are executed.\n\nBy 2025, companies standing still on AI adoption risk being left in the dust, while those that embrace it stand to gain in efficiency, creativity, and growth.\n\nWith such sweeping change, employees must stay ahead of the AI curve. Familiarity with AI is no longer just a feather in the cap \u2013 it\u2019s essential for job relevance. HR and business leaders, too, must balance leveraging automation with nurturing uniquely human skills across their teams.\n\nLeaders should champion AI literacy, fostering a culture of lifelong learning and empowering cross-functional teams and AI committees to steer responsible AI usage.\n\nIn an era leaning towards skills-based hiring, helping employees develop AI-related competencies is no longer a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a business imperative. These must-have skills blend technical acumen with a uniquely human touch, forming a toolkit for today\u2019s AI-enhanced workplace.\n\nHere are five indispensable AI skills that will help your workforce thrive in the future of work:\n\n1. Technical proficiency\n\nUnderstanding AI tools and technologies is the bedrock of the modern workforce. Workers need to be fluent in data literacy, machine learning basics, and AI integration. Technical proficiency becomes the engine that powers sharper decision-making, problem-solving, and productivity.\n\nWhy it matters: As AI becomes woven into daily workflows, employees must know how to work alongside it. This doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs to morph into a data scientist, but they should know enough to clean data, harness AI tools, and streamline processes.\n\nDeveloping this skill: Organisations can spark curiosity through machine learning workshops, data visualisation courses, and opportunities for hands-on experience. By creating a culture where employees are encouraged to \u2018peek under the AI hood,\u2019 companies ensure their workforce remains engaged and adaptable to technological advancements.\n\nAlso Read: Are layoffs really necessary when adopting AI?\n\n2. Adaptability\n\nIn a world driven by AI, the ability to pivot is worth its weight in gold. Job roles will evolve as AI automation reshapes the landscape, and workers must adopt a mindset of lifelong learning to stay agile. Adaptability is the secret weapon in a workforce where roles are constantly morphing.\n\nWhy it matters: AI\u2019s capabilities are snowballing, and the skillsets required today may be obsolete tomorrow. Employees who resist change risk becoming relics, while those who adapt can wield AI as a tool to enhance their roles.\n\nDeveloping this skill: Employers can nurture adaptability by rotating roles, assigning cross-departmental projects, and encouraging skill expansion. Training in change management and resilience will also build a workforce primed to embrace, rather than fear, the unknown.\n\n3. Creativity\n\nAs AI takes on the heavy lifting of routine tasks, human creativity shines as a valuable differentiator. AI can generate content or automate workflows, but it cannot ignite the creative spark that fuels problem-solving, innovation, and strategic thinking.\n\nWhy it matters: In a future brimming with AI, creativity is the golden ticket to faster innovation and novel approaches to business challenges. While AI provides the \u201chow,\u201d humans still define the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhy.\u201d Creative thinking will keep businesses nimble and ready to tackle shifting market demands.\n\nDeveloping this skill: Employers can foster creativity through brainstorming sessions, cross-functional collaborations, and innovation challenges. By promoting a culture where thinking outside the box isn\u2019t just allowed but rewarded, organisations can unleash their team\u2019s full creative potential.\n\n4. Emotional intelligence\n\nAI might handle numbers, logic, and trends, but it can\u2019t hold a candle to human empathy. Emotional intelligence (EQ) will continue to be a linchpin in roles that require collaboration, leadership, and client interaction. It\u2019s the glue that holds workplace relationships together.\n\nWhy it matters: Skills like empathy, communication, and conflict resolution underpin teamwork and customer satisfaction. Employees with strong EQ can bridge the gap between AI and human users, making sure automation enhances rather than disrupts the workplace dynamic.\n\nDeveloping this skill: Organisations should cultivate EQ by offering empathy-building exercises, active listening training, and conflict resolution workshops. A culture that values open communication, constructive feedback, and emotional well-being will see EQ flourish across the team.\n\nAlso Read: How do we prepare for the future of work?\n\n5. Ethical judgment and integrity\n\nAs AI moves from novelty to necessity, employees must understand the ethical ramifications of these tools. From data privacy to bias in algorithms, ethical judgment ensures that AI decisions align with values and societal good.\n\nWhy it matters: AI is capable of making life-altering decisions, from hiring to healthcare recommendations. Without human oversight, AI could perpetuate biases, violate privacy, or act without accountability. Ethical judgment is crucial to steer AI responsibly.\n\nDeveloping this skill: Employers can encourage ethical awareness through regular ethics training and discussions on real-world AI dilemmas. Creating AI ethics committees will help organisations keep their AI strategies aligned with both company values and the wider social fabric.\n\nHow to cultivate these 5 AI skills\n\nThe journey to AI readiness is a partnership. Employees need to take the reins of their own learning, whether through online resources, AI projects, or internal training.\n\nEmployers, on the other hand, must provide access to these opportunities and foster a culture of growth. Educational institutions, too, should refresh their curricula to blend technical knowledge with the timeless qualities AI cannot replace.\n\nInstead of viewing AI as a looming threat, let\u2019s see it as a lever for human potential. By honing our unique skills \u2013 creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical judgment \u2013 we can create a future where AI isn\u2019t just a job disruptor but a force multiplier for innovation, growth, and opportunity.",

        "text": "AI is transforming the workplace, providing unparalleled opportunities for efficiency. However, like any powerful tool, AI also presents its own set of risks unless this is managed effectively by employers.\n\nWe have all witnessed the meteoric rise of AI in recent years and, specifically, the use of AI in the workplace. Notably, Microsoft recently reported that three out of four people use AI at work, with usage nearly doubling in the last six months alone. In particular, AI technology is being widely used at all stages of the employment life cycle, for example, to screen applications during the initial recruitment stage; for training and development purposes; for data analysis relating to employee engagement; and for the purposes of employee performance evaluations.\n\nMind the Gender AI Gap\n\nWhilst the opportunities that AI brings are seemingly unending, there are concerns that AI has the potential to produce biased outcomes that favour men over women. This could be influenced by various factors, including the data used to train AI systems, as well as the specific demographic of individuals who are developing new AI technology (with women currently making up less than a third of AI professionals). For example, if an AI system is trained on historical data that reflects past gender biases, it could perpetuate those same biases in its output and there have been instances where AI algorithms have inadvertently favoured male candidates in recruitment processes. Unless properly managed, this could result in biased hiring and promotion decisions, further entrenching gender disparities in a workplace \u2013 and, from a legal standpoint, this could leave employers open to claims for discrimination under the Equality Act 2010.\n\nNot only this, statistics also demonstrate that there exists an \u2018adoption gap\u2019 between men and women when it comes to use of AI \u2013 although this gap is closing rapidly, studies have demonstrated that some women remain hesitant to use AI, or simply feel that they do not have the time available to get to grips with it. Without encouragement and specific engagement strategies aimed at women to upskill them in AI, there is a risk that employers could experience a skills gap that reinforces existing barriers to women\u2019s progression. If AI is unequally adopted across genders and demographics, this could further exacerbate the potential for biased outputs.\n\nDoes AI Represent an Opportunity to Accelerate Gender Equity in the Workplace?\n\nThe good news is that, provided the risks are managed properly by organisations, AI could reap significant rewards when it comes to levelling the gender playing field. For instance, if employers ensure that diverse and representative data is inputted into AI then this has the potential to minimise the unconscious biases of humans in recruitment, promotion, and other talent management decisions. Similarly, AI-driven tools can analyse job descriptions to identify and remove gender-biased language, making job postings more inclusive and attractive to a diverse pool of candidates.\n\nWhat Practical Steps Can Employers Take?\n\nTo mitigate the risks of gender bias in AI, organisations should take proactive steps to:\n\nImplement clear policies and procedures in relation to AI and its use \u2013 in particular, these policies should cover ethics, transparency and bias mitigation. Organisations should be open about AI decision-making processes and be able to explain how AI systems make decisions that impact employees.\n\n\u2013 in particular, these policies should cover ethics, transparency and bias mitigation.

        "text": "The use of AI has become fully integrated into many areas of our lives in the last 12 months, with people now using it for everything from planning holidays and writing letters to crafting wedding speeches.\n\nHowever, the widest use we\u2019ve seen for it has been in the workplace. Whatever the sector, employees are finding ways of using generative AI software, such as ChatGPT or Microsoft 360 CoPilot for writing tasks, ideation or research, helping to make their jobs easier and to make workers more productive.\n\nIn the last year, as employers and organisations have begun understanding how AI technology can support their teams, we\u2019ve seen exactly how AI is transforming employee behaviour and practices in the workplace. Using AI for a range of tasks frees them up to engage in creative and strategic work, fostering both personal fulfilment and workplace innovation.\n\nA recent study* \u2018surveyed more than 1,100 workers across the UK who handle data as part of their job and confirmed that exactly half of them now use AI at work.\n\nThe employees we questioned worked across 12 different sectors and we asked them to share what impact they think AI has had on their work, their wellbeing and the amount of time they spend on their work.\n\nA staggering 93% of them said the impact of using AI technology at work had been positive. Around 82% of them said AI has helped them produce better work, and almost 60% believe it has reduced their workload stress. These are staggering stats really considering it\u2019s been a relatively short time since AI technology has become a useful tool for employees and widely adopted by businesses.\n\nImproving work-life balance and diversity\n\nAI technology can be helpful in completing routine tasks much quicker and potentially to a higher standard, enabling teams to focus on more creative and rewarding work while also enjoying a better work-life balance and improved job satisfaction. AI can take away the burden of mundane admin tasks for employees. It can speed up data collection or research, draft bulk emails or summarise large reports or documents.\n\nAnd as workplaces begin to experiment with the best uses of AI for their organisations, they will also realise the potential it can bring.\n\nThere\u2019s growing evidence that AI could improve equality and diversity in the workplace by reducing bias during the recruitment process, supporting different learning styles, or providing hyper-targeted training programmes for employees from under-represented groups to progress in their careers.\n\nAs Caroline Fanning, Chief Employee Success Officer at The Access Group, points out, from a strategic HR or recruitment point of view, AI can help match people with the right skills to a job opportunity without interference of human bias. This is turn has a real positive impact on diversity hiring practices. She added:\n\n\u201cAI tools empower people in their learning, help them process large amounts of information and manage their time easily. That makes AI particularly useful for our neurodiverse employees, including those with dyslexia, dyscalculia (difficulty understanding numbers) and ADHD.\n\n\u201cHowever, employers must ensure that nobody feels left behind by AI \u2013 and training is key. At The Access Group, our goal is to ensure that all our people are AI literate and benefit from the technology\u2019s capabilities. This extends to our customers as well.\u201d\n\nPositive impact on employees\n\nOne of the biggest findings from the research was that 93% of workers, whatever their sector, believe that using AI has had a positive impact on their working life. Nearly a third of respondents (32%) said AI technology gave them more freedom to focus on what\u2019s important to their job, while 29% said it enhances customer service.\n\nThis shows that, if used correctly, the positives of using AI can far outweigh the negatives. It\u2019s not about looking at it as replacing workers, but how it can help them instead, while also improving their end results. For example, employees who are now spending less time on admin can give more of their time to building relationships with customers and improving the service they offer.\n\nSome other important stats from our research include:\n\nMore than half of participants (55%) said AI saves them time.\n\n42% of workers believe AI saves their organisation money and another 42% say it helps employees be more productive.\n\nEmployees in tech (74%) and HR/Recruitment (68%) are leading the way in the adoption of AI tools at work.\n\n45% of UK workers said using AI helped them with repetitive tasks and 35% said it helped to manage their workload.\n\nOne of the most interesting findings from our study was that many employees are using AI in secret. More than a third (35%) admitted they were using it to get ahead of their colleagues and not telling their boss about it. This was largely prevalent among younger workers aged 18-29 who said they have done this \u2018many times\u2019 for completing tasks at work to stand out from their colleagues.\n\nBiggest worries around AI\n\nWe found that however enthused employees were about AI, there are some concerns, not just around job replacement, but also of illegitimate use and data security.\n\nFor all the benefits of generative AI, there are still many unknowns for organisations, particularly around copyright and data security and whether people really have the skills and confidence to use it. Senior leaders need to strike a balance between enabling employees to get the most from technology and mitigating security risks.\n\nThe biggest worry about data security came from IT professionals (51%), no doubt because they understand the potential risks of the technology, closely followed by workers in health and social care (50.8%) and HR and recruitment (50.4%).\n\nWhile there are early adopters of new technology in every organisation, it can take some employees longer to feel comfortable with using AI and feel assured that the data and confidential information they\u2019re dealing with is safe and secure.\n\nWhen it comes to confidence with AI, almost a quarter of respondents to our survey scored their confidence level at five out of 10 or less. However, the majority are in the middle with a score of six to seven, so there is room for targeted training to upskill and build confidence among employees when it comes to using AI for their work. There is also scope for business leaders and decision makers to ensure they are investing in the best available technology to help them achieve their goals.\n\nStand out from the crowd\n\nThe buzz around AI is not going to disappear in 2025 and organisations already using the technology will have a considerable advantage over their competitors that aren\u2019t.\n\nAs employees continue to embrace AI into their daily workflows, it\u2019s vital their employers match their expectations by investing in tools that are both intuitive and make a genuine difference to their working lives. They need to play their part in providing training and resources to upskill and build confidence in the workforce, as well as demystifying what AI is and what it can do.\n\nThis is why AI is so transformative. It enhances workflows, improves efficiency, and reduces the fear of falling behind in an ever-evolving tech landscape.\n\nAI is not just reshaping how we work, it\u2019s redefining what we can achieve, and in using the right tech, organisations can really harness its power to reduce employee stress, boost productivity and allow teams to focus on high-value, purpose-driven activities. It\u2019s an exciting time for realising the potential of AI and the impact it can really have on the workforce.\n\n*Research carried out by The Access Group\n\nThe Powerful impact of AI on workplace behavior",

Drazen_ | E+ | Getty Images\n\nArtificial intelligence is disrupting global industries and workforces, but it may also set in motion an entirely new economy. Although the idea of AI dates to the mid-1900s, the technology catapulted into common discourse after the launch of OpenAI's generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022. \"But [generative AI] isn't just another invention,\" said Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn. \"It's a turning point, forcing us to rethink not just what work is, but what it means to be human at work.\"\n\nSimilar to the Industrial Revolution, AI is pushing us into a new era, said Raman. \"For centuries, work was about our physical abilities on farms, and then again in the factories,\" said Raman. \"It's only been the past couple decades that work has been about our intellectual abilities.\"\n\nA new economy is on the way ... the innovation economy. Aneesh Raman Chief economic opportunity officer, LinkedIn\n\nNow the rise of AI is sparking a new discussion: If automation takes over more physical tasks and artificial intelligence takes over more intellectual ones, humans will be defined by their social abilities, said Raman. \"The knowledge economy is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way for us humans at work,\" he said. \"I'm calling it the innovation economy.\" In this new era, \"human innovation and our uniquely human skills, like social and emotional intelligence\" will be key, he added. Skills such as creativity, curiosity, courage, compassion and communication \u2014 or \"the 5 C's\" \u2014 are what underpin innovation, allowing us to come up with new ideas that challenge the status quo, collaborate, and ultimately build together, he said.\n\nAI also stands to democratize innovation in a way we've never seen before, said Raman. \"The systems of work have traditionally privileged pedigree over potential \u2014 very few humans across history have had the right credentials and the right connections to get access to the capital they needed to turn ideas into inventions,\" he said. A research paper by economist Raj Chetty along with other researchers, coined the term \"lost Einsteins\" to describe potential innovators who are limited by their socioeconomic status. The paper, which compared tax and school district records of more than one million patent holders in the U.S., found that children with parents in the top 1% of the income distribution were ten times more likely to become inventors than children of parents with below median income.\n\n\"Where [AI] is set to have the biggest impact is in helping people sitting on great ideas and great inventions finally bring those ideas to life,\" said Raman. The technology can not only help automate routine tasks, but it can also be \"your sounding board, your co-founder, your coder\" and more, he said. \"Think about what happens when an entrepreneur in Brazil can prototype a climate technology solution without needing a full engineering team. Or when a teacher in rural India can build and deploy an educational platform without needing to write code,\" he added.",

Yet when asked about AI\u2019s role in hiring and promotions, a much larger 71% of respondents voiced worries\u2014more than double the share concerned about their own jobs.\n\nThese survey results underscore an important yet often overlooked point: AI is poised to change not just what work we do, but how it is done. As AI tools advance, workers can expect to be managed increasingly by algorithms. Even now, employers have access to AI-powered tools that recruit, compensate, monitor, direct, and evaluate workers. Although the ultimate effects of these tools are unknown, they pose real risks of eroding job quality and worsening income inequality.\n\nUnfortunately, researchers and policy-makers currently lack the data necessary to understand how workplace AI affects workers and businesses. Existing AI data collection efforts tend to focus on the automation of tasks and the productivity of new technologies, missing a critical aspect: AI\u2019s role as a manager.\n\nThe Rise of the AI Manager\n\nThroughout history, new technologies have found their way into management systems. In Charlie Chaplin\u2019s 1936 film Modern Times, celebrated for its dystopian caricature of the factory age, the first technological marvel shown is not some industrial machine, but a two-way television used by the boss to monitor workers.\n\nSure enough, CCTV systems soon took on the role of production-line supervisors. Punch cards gave way to RFID and biometric scanners. Factory managers hung up their stopwatches and let assembly lines set the pace.\n\nToday, employers are adopting AI tools to take on a wide range of management functions. Algorithms target job ads to job seekers, screen resumes, calibrate wage offers, and suggest raises. Monitoring software tracks drivers\u2019 eye movements, records desk workers\u2019 app usage, and infers the moods of call-center workers. In high-tech warehouses, AI-powered systems guide workers\u2019 movements and score them in real time.\n\nLeading the shift towards AI-powered management are platform-work companies like Uber and TaskRabbit, where algorithms touch nearly every aspect of the job. Machine learning tools match customers to workers and set pay levels. Hiring and firing occur largely via app.\n\nYet gig work is hardly the only sector where AI tools play a role in staffing and management. In a 2024 survey of HR professionals, 26% of respondents reported using some form of AI, largely for recruitment and hiring. Among these, 10% said their firms employed AI-enabled monitoring systems. Another survey, this one targeting recruitment and hiring managers, found 60% of respondents reporting the use of AI-powered hiring tools like resume screeners or applicant scoring systems.\n\nHow AI Upends the Story of Automation\n\nIf management technology has been around so long, does AI really change anything? The short answer is yes. The standard view in economics is that automation historically took hold where routine tasks could be broken down into codifiable steps: weaving thread, stamping metal, adding numbers. Where work was non-routine or only tacitly understood, as in creative work and some manual labor, automation posed little threat.\n\nAI upends these old patterns. AI systems can decipher handwriting, interpret X-rays, and compose original sonnets. They do this without a set of detailed instructions, relying instead on training data and machine learning algorithms. With the right data, AI systems can also be trained to detect when a worker may be loafing or predict the wage a job seeker might accept. This is something new under the sun.\n\nWhile economists have developed robust theories about AI\u2019s impact on employment, they have grappled less with AI in management and HR (especially compared to scholars from other disciplines). This gap arises partly because economists typically use a so-called task model, viewing jobs as bundles of tasks with varying degrees of susceptibility to automation. This focus on the content of work abstracts from the context of work, particularly how workers are managed.\n\nThe economic implications of AI in management and human resources could be substantial. In my research, I explore how AI might affect worker power, focusing on AI used to staff, monitor, direct and evaluate workers. In a range of theoretical models, I show how AI tools could reduce worker pay or exacerbate inequality. To use the academic jargon, AI may enable employers to capture a greater share of \u201ceconomic rents\u201d associated with a job. Translation: Workers end up with a smaller slice of the pie.\n\nThis is all to say that the question is not only \u201cwill AI take my job?\u201d but also \u201cwill AI take my boss\u2019s job?\u201d\n\nIt may not all be bad news, of course. AI-powered job recommendations could steer workers to better opportunities. Hiring algorithms may be less biased than the humans they complement. Even an AI monitoring system may be preferable to a capricious office tyrant.\n\nMeasuring Workplace AI\n\nThe broad effects of AI tools in workplace settings are unknown. The theoretical concerns spelled out above have some basis in case studies and popular reporting, but they remain untested quantitatively. For that, we need data.\n\nOn the worker side, compelling new findings indicate that millions of workers feel the weight of digital management tools in the workplace. As Columbia University professor Alexander Hertel-Fernandez documents in survey-based research for the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, more than two-thirds of US workers report some form of digital monitoring on the job, while nearly 40% report that algorithmic assignment of tasks or schedules. More intense management technologies were associated with lower job satisfaction and well-being. (The tools reported on in the survey may or may not involve AI.)\n\nIn order to complement and extend these findings from the employee side, we also need data on the employer side\u2014and, ideally, data that researchers could link to government-collected tax and administrative records. Outside of a few private-sector efforts, we have a limited understanding of AI\u2019s prevalence in management and HR. Ideally, the US Census Bureau would include questions on this topic in its surveys of private businesses, particularly the Annual Business Survey (ABS), which collects data from 300,000 businesses every year.\n\nIn some years, the ABS has included questions about AI used by businesses in producing goods and services, excluding other AI applications like hiring and firing. And while fielding new census questions will be arduous, it\u2019s necessary. Enhanced visibility into AI's role in the workplace will support better decision-making and policy development, from the factory floor up to the halls of Congress.\n\nOther statistical agencies around the globe already have some experience in querying firms about AI used throughout the organization. The EU\u2019s survey on new technologies has asked about AI use across a variety of business processes, including human resources management and recruiting. Israel\u2019s statistical agency has asked similar questions. Their experiences could provide valuable insights for the US.\n\nAs AI continues to transform the economy, it is crucial for researchers and policymakers to have access to comprehensive data on AI\u2019s scope, scale, and impact. Only then can we begin to unpack the performance of AI managers, and make decisions about what we want our workplaces to look like.",

        "text": "The use of AI in the hiring process does not come without its fair share of risks. One major concern is around \"hallucinations,\" where AI might produce outputs that seem logical but are factually incorrect.5 Another issue is the potential loss of creativity. For instance, a journalist relying on AI to increase the number of articles they publish may have the unintended consequence of reducing the amount of time they spend on creative thinking, which often occurs during downtime.\n\nWhile AI is an effective recruitment tool for well-defined roles with a large talent pool, it struggles with novel or significantly altered jobs. Validating criteria for new roles requires extensive data, which is often challenging to gather without the risk of AI tools infringing on proprietary information. With that said, ensuring that AI algorithms are trained on diverse and representative data sets is key to avoid perpetuating existing biases.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind that some regulatory environments, particularly in Europe, mandate human oversight in high risk areas such as employment to ensure transparency and fairness.6 Thus, while AI can augment the recruitment process, the involvement of human judgment remains necessary to mitigate the risks associated with this nascent technology.\n\nIn the legal field particularly, the reliance on AI-generated contracts must be balanced with thorough review by trained lawyers. As will be discussed below, this is critical to ensure legal compliance and the consideration of unique contractual nuances.",

        "text": "American Workers Have Mixed Feelings About AI\u2019s Workplace Potential\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) applications have proliferated rapidly in the past two years, leading to both excitement and concern about what the technology means for the future of work.\n\nBut in a new Pew Research Center poll, 52 percent of U.S. workers say they are worried about the future impact of AI use at work, and 32 percent say it will likely lead to fewer job opportunities for them in the long run. Lower- and middle-income workers are more likely to say AI will lead to fewer job opportunities. Across all workers, only 6 percent said AI use will lead to more opportunities for them in the long run.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom\u201436 percent of workers say they feel hopeful about how AI might be used in the workplace.\n\nAI isn\u2019t a future issue, either. For 16 percent of workers surveyed, at least some of their work is currently done with AI, and another 25 percent said that while they are not currently using AI, at least some of their work can be done with AI. Among young workers and those with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, these percentages are significantly higher, Pew reported. For workplace AI users, 73 percent are under 50 years of age, and about half have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nWhat AI tools are in use? Chatbots\u2014such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot\u2014are popular, with 9 percent of workers saying that they use them at work every day or a few times a week. These chatbots are most often used for research, editing written content, or drafting written content.\n\nDid AI help those workers? Forty percent of users said the chatbots helped them do things more quickly, and 29 percent said the chatbots helped improve the quality of their work.\n\nSecurity professionals are also curious about AI applications for their jobs. According to a new ASIS International research report, 2025 Security Trends: Understanding the Evolving Role of Security, 57 percent of survey respondents said they had used at least one AI-powered tool for security, and many were interested in learning more about the tools available\u2014both for security-specific applications and more general ones.\n\nOf the 57 percent who had used AI in a security application, 46 percent said AI had been a helpful tool and 9 percent said AI had far exceeded their expectations. One in five, however, said it was too soon to tell if the tools were effective.\n\nData from the 2025 ASIS Security Trends study shows security professionals have begun dabbling in artificial intelligence applications and think there is great potential in the near future. https://t.co/yT9tciAfUz \u2014 Security Management (@SecMgmtMag) February 25, 2025\n\n\u201cWhen looking specifically at the benefits of using AI, half (51 percent) of security professionals who said they had used AI in a security application reported that AI had helped them create stronger ties to other departments,\u201d wrote Scott Briscoe in a summary of the survey results for Security Management.\n\n\u201cOther benefits included automating incident response, expanding perimeter patrolling capacity, and allowing frontline security to spend less time patrolling\u2014each of these benefits was cited by approximately one-third of those who had used AI. Less prevalent was AI leading to a decrease in overall security staffing (17 percent) or a reduction in frontline personnel allowing increases in other security personnel (14 percent).\n\n\u201cOverall, security professionals think highly about the potential for AI: two-thirds said it was an important tool and they were eager to learn more as it develops, and most of the rest were even more enthusiastic, with 29 percent saying AI is transformative and they try to stay on top of the latest knowledge,\u201d Briscoe continued. \u201cOnly four percent said they thought AI was overblown.\u201d\n\nFor more on security trends and artificial intelligence, read the entire ASIS Research: 2025 Security Trends series.",

        "text": "A provocative billboard in San Francisco last December declared, \u201cStop hiring humans \u2013 the era of AI employees is here.\u201d The ad, created by tech firm Artisan, sparked outrage and comparisons to the dystopian TV show Black Mirror. Though Artisan\u2019s CEO later admitted it was a publicity stunt, the underlying message remains clear: artificial intelligence is reshaping the world of work at an unprecedented pace.\n\nAs New Scientist reports, AI\u2019s rapid rise in the job market is both disruptive and transformative, with far-reaching consequences for workers, industries, and governments worldwide. A survey by HR Technologies UK found that 80% of employers were likely to use AI in hiring. Klarna, a prominent \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d company, announced it had reduced its workforce by a quarter\u2014approximately 1,250 employees\u2014thanks to AI efficiencies. The company justified the cuts by stating that the savings allowed for increased pay for remaining staff.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund predicts that AI will affect nearly 40% of all jobs globally. In the UK alone, the Tony Blair Institute estimates that up to 275,000 private sector jobs could be displaced annually, with that number potentially reaching 3 million by 2050. US unions, like SAG-AFTRA, which represents 160,000 voice actors, are already striking against the use of generative AI in industries like video games, fearing job losses and diminished creative autonomy. Elon Musk has fueled the debate, predicting that AI could one day eradicate the need for jobs altogether, calling it \u201cthe most disruptive force in the industry for jobs.\u201d\n\nWhile AI encroaches on traditional roles such as graphic design, customer service, and even teaching, some professions appear more insulated. Research by the OECD and Goldman Sachs reveals that careers demanding subjective reasoning and human empathy\u2014such as surgeons, psychologists, and judges\u2014are safer from automation. Therapists, for instance, rely heavily on emotional intelligence, compassion, and ethical reasoning, elements AI struggles to replicate. Similarly, blue-collar roles like plumbers, roofers, and pest controllers remain resistant due to their hands-on nature.\n\nHowever, industries are not just bracing for disruption\u2014they are also creating opportunities. Job postings for AI-related roles, such as machine learning engineers and prompt engineers, are booming. In the US, AI jobs command salaries 77% higher than other roles, with nearly a third of all tech positions in late 2023 being AI-related. On LinkedIn, the demand for \u201chead of AI\u201d positions rose by 26% in just one year.\n\nGovernments and corporations are grappling with how to manage AI\u2019s rapid development. While the UK government has proposed measures to regulate powerful AI models, critics worry that such efforts are too slow to keep pace with technological advancements. LinkedIn\u2019s UK manager, Janine Chamberlin, advises workers to embrace lifelong learning, noting that the labor market will continue to evolve unpredictably as AI transforms the nature of work.\n\nThe rise of AI may eliminate certain jobs, but it is also creating new opportunities and reshaping industries. Whether this era of transformation represents a threat or an opportunity depends largely on how workers, businesses, and governments adapt to the rapid pace of change. As New Scientist highlights, navigating a post-AI world will require anticipating shifts and prioritizing reskilling to thrive in a dynamic and unpredictable job market.",

        "text": "Corndel, a provider of industry training and consultancy, has published its 2025 Workplace Training Report. The study reveals a growing disconnect between leaders and employees in their perceptions of their AI preparedness. It points towards a significant opportunity for employers to address the shortage of data and AI skills across industries.\n\nThe latest report found that HR leaders are confident about their organisation\u2019s AI readiness. 88% are confident in leadership\u2019s ability to guide AI adoption. 60% very confident that training programs are equipping employees with the necessary skills for digital transformation.\n\nHowever, the view from the organisation\u2019s front lines is less optimistic. 71% of middle managers actively leverage AI in daily tasks, 52% of employees said they have never used AI tools. Alarmingly, although 97% of HR leaders claim their organisations offer AI training \u2013 and 50% believed it to have been comprehensive. Only 39% of employees report having received it. Among younger employees, 74% use AI tools regularly, but just 52% have received formal training. Only 14% rate this training as highly effective.\n\nEmployees unprepared to adopt AI\n\nAs a result, one-third of UK employees feel unprepared to adopt AI in the next 1\u20133 years. Only 55% of employees trust their managers to lead digital transformation effectively. Furthermore, just 4 in 10 believe they can adopt AI tools themselves. This lack of knowledge and access to AI tools threatens to undermine the potential gains businesses expect from AI adoption.\n\n67% of executives cite geopolitical instability as the greatest threat to growth. The research suggests the real dangers lie closer to home. Falling morale and low productivity, with failing morale and low productivity damaging many organisation\u2019s ability to succeed. 82% of HR leaders report their organisations are experiencing change fatigue. 1 in 2 employees feel workplace anxiety at least once a week. This is a significant obstacle to growth. Without the skills and resilience needed to manage, organisations risk falling behind.\n\n48% of senior leaders admit they haven\u2019t yet used an AI tool, compared to 29% of middle managers. While it\u2019s not uncommon for leaders to be less involved with day-to-day tooling. This becomes problematic when they are expected to set direction, identify opportunities, and support their teams. However, without sight of how these tools actually work. This knowledge gap may explain why CEOs overestimated the potential gains from AI adoption last year. According to PwC\u2019s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey, 34% of CEOs reported profitability improvements, significantly below the 46% who had anticipated these outcomes.\n\nCreating AI strategies without experience\n\n\u201cMany senior leaders are being asked to set AI strategies without hands-on experience of the tools themselves,\u201d explains Sean Cosgrove, Chief Commercial Officer at Corndel. \u201cThe National Data Strategy has already flagged the gap in leadership-level data skills, which extends to AI. Leaders don\u2019t just need a vision for AI adoption \u2013 they need a real understanding of the skills their workforce requires. For many, even foundational AI skills like crafting effective prompts for generative AI are missing. That\u2019s a gap we need to close.\u201d\n\nAccording to Corndel, many organisations are focusing their training efforts on narrow groups. These include technical teams or senior leadership, rather than an offering across the broader workforce. Yet, Corndel found that 88% of employees using generative AI are in non-technical roles. This means that the people most likely to use AI day-to-day\u2014managers, customer service reps, and analysts\u2014are often receiving the least by way of training. Without proper training, AI adoption is likely to remain low, stalling the promised impact of AI.\n\nCosgrove added, \u201cOur research shows that leadership teams are confident in AI strategies, but many employees don\u2019t feel prepared to keep up. Without the right training, AI adoption stalls before it even starts. Organisations must take a more strategic approach to AI skills development\u2014reaching beyond technical teams to the workforce.\u201d\n\nOrganisations that understand the need for cross-departmental AI literacy and embrace AI across all functions are 2.5 times more likely to prioritise reskilling and upskilling, capturing substantial cost efficiencies and revenue gains.\n\nBusinesses need to act on four key areas\n\nTo ensure AI adoption is successful, Corndel is calling on businesses to act decisively in four key areas:\n\nEnhance AI leadership readiness: Upskill leaders in AI fundamentals and change skills to drive transformation and inspire trust.\n\nClose critical skills gaps: Prioritise technical, human, and data training to build a future-ready workforce.\n\nLeverage apprenticeships: Maximise the Apprenticeship Levy to develop critical technology, data, and leadership skills.\n\nBoost productivity: Optimise AI to address workload imbalances, streamline processes, and improve team performance.\n\nCorndel, in partnership with Imperial College London and supported by Microsoft, has launched The Enterprise AI Academy. The AI Academy aims to help large, complex organisations embed AI skills at all levels. Its programmes include Strategic AI Leadership, AI Engineering, AI Changemaker, and AI Productivity and equip professionals with the skills needed to realise AI\u2019s potential.\n\nEnterprise Times: What this means for businesses.\n\nAs AI begins to impact the UK economy, a worrying new disconnect is emerging in the workplace. Business leaders and employees have very different views of how AI-ready their organisation is. Already automation and generative AI are accelerating change in businesses, irrespective of size and sector. As a result, the demand for human and technical skills is outpacing many organisations\u2019 ability to adapt.\n\nFlexible working, the drive for sustainability, and rapid advances in AI and technology are transforming the workplace at a dizzying speed. The report suggests workers are struggling to keep up. Although some people have a natural aptitude for change, today\u2019s workforce is increasingly dissatisfied, anxious, and less productive.\n\nCorndel\u2019s Workplace Training Report 2025 offers a roadmap for navigating these challenges. It moves beyond diagnosis to provide actionable strategies for creating a resilient, future-ready workforce. By aligning training with strategic goals and embedding critical change skills into organisational DNA, enterprises can create workplaces that succeed. In the context of rapid change, there is also great opportunity for growth. The report suggests companies investing in people, fostering resilience, using training as a lever for transformation will thrive and succeed.",

The consulting firm has predicted that by 2030, activities accounting for up to 30% of hours worked across the US economy could be automated.\n\nBloomberg reported that Operator will use a computer to take actions on a user\u2019s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel.\n\nLast year, Microsoft\u2019s head of AI, Mustafa Suleyman, indicated the company is moving towards agents that can make purchasing decisions, saying he had seen \u201cstunning demos\u201d where the agent carries out transactions independently, although there have also been \u201ccar crash moments\u201d in development. However, an agent with these capabilities will emerge \u201cin quarters, not years\u201d, Suleyman said.\n\nBefore making the agent prediction, Altman also wrote in his blog that OpenAI knows how to build artificial general intelligence (AGI), a theoretical term that he has referred to in the past as \u201cAI systems that are generally smarter than humans\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\u201d he wrote, adding that OpenAI was now turning its ambitions towards \u201csuperintelligence\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future. With superintelligence, we can do anything else,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cSuperintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.\u201d\n\nAltman also participated in a Q&A with Bloomberg published this weekend in which he predicted that Elon Musk will continue his feud with OpenAI this year, but will stop short of using his relationship with Donald Trump to hurt the company.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think he\u2019ll continue to sue us and drop lawsuits and make new lawsuits and whatever else,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t challenged me to a cage match yet, but I don\u2019t think he was that serious about it with Zuck, either, it turned out \u2026 he says a lot of things, starts them, undoes them, gets sued, sues, gets in fights with the government, gets investigated by the government. That\u2019s just Elon being Elon.\u201d\n\nMusk dropped an initial lawsuit against OpenAI in June last year but returned two months later with a new complaint that has been expanded to include Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s biggest backer.

OpenAI was founded with the aim of building \u201csafe and beneficial\u201d AGI.\n\nAltman added that he did not expect Musk to use his influence within the incoming Trump administration to hobble competitors such as OpenAI. Musk launched a new AI business, xAI, in 2023.\n\n\u201cWill he abuse his political power of being co-president, or whatever he calls himself now, to mess with a business competitor?

        "text": "The data is in: 2024 is the year AI at work gets real. Use of generative AI has nearly doubled in the last six months,1 with 75% of global knowledge workers using it. And employees, struggling under the pace and volume of work, are bringing their own AI to work. While leaders agree AI is a business imperative, many believe their organization lacks a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line. The pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders inert, even in the face of AI inevitability.\n\nWe\u2019ve come to the hard part of any tech disruption: moving past experimentation to business transformation. Just as we saw with the advent of the internet or the PC, business transformation comes with broad adoption. Organizations that apply AI to drive growth, manage costs, and deliver greater value to customers will pull ahead.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market is set to shift again\u2014with AI playing a major role. Despite fears of job loss, leaders report a talent shortage for key roles. And as more employees eye a career move, managers say AI aptitude could rival experience. For many employees, AI will raise the bar but break the career ceiling.\n\nTo help leaders and organizations overcome AI inertia, Microsoft and LinkedIn looked at how AI will reshape work and the labor market broadly, surveying 31,000 people across 31 countries, identifying labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, and analyzing trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals as well as research with Fortune 500 customers. The data points to insights every leader and professional needs to know\u2014and actions they can take\u2014when it comes to AI\u2019s implications for work.",

        "text": "Now is the time for upskilling workforces for AI and for organisations to benefit from the 'commoditisation' of work\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) offers many benefits to organisations, from taking away low-hanging administrative tasks to allowing employees to be repositioned to add greater value. And, within HR, AI can offers a wide range of solutions from scheduling or carrying out recruitment to performance assessments and monitoring employee wellbeing.\n\nBut the knowledge and opinions about AI's vary widely despite its growth in the workplace and on the HR agenda. While some organisations are already engaging with AI-driven solutions, such as ChaptGPT and \"sandboxes\", others are trying to find ways to use the technology appropriately.\n\nUnderstand the risks\n\nAI brings a range of risks that HR professionals need to understand. It can reinforce discrimination in biased data. It can pose issues around intellectual property, such as the use of other people\u2019s material to develop an AI solution without their consent. It can potentially deskill workforces. And AI can raise issues around who creates and owns complications arising from its use.\n\nThere is ongoing government-level legislative and regulatory activity, but this presently involves more discussion than implementation. Organisations wanting to take advantage of the evolving technology will need to be ready to adapt and be flexible when and as rules are introduced.\n\nEducation and experience\n\nEmployers will encounter a range of issues as they adopt AI. Speaking at a recent Osborne Clarke AI event Sue Turner, founder director of AI Governance, a UK business consultancy, emphasised the need for executive education for leaders of organisations to understand what AI is, what it can do and, particularly, the ethical issues it raises.\n\nWhen AI is introduced into an organisation, its leaders need to understand systems or approaches to mitigate risks in order to get the full value from the technology. Employers are exploring the introduction of frameworks to govern the use and development of AI. Although this can be at the cost of innovation and efficiencies, employers are looking to find the right policies to encourage the adoption and use of AI without exposing themselves to greater risks.\n\nThere has been a proliferation of AI \"claimed to be\" solutions touted to employers and, in particular, HR, according to Turner. The growing uptake of AI means that third-party suppliers need to be challenged over what their AI does and what data has been built on. \"You need to know enough about what AI is doing to ask if this right for your organisation\" she said. \"You should ask: is the science behind it real?\u201d\n\nIs it or isn't it AI?\n\nOrganisations need to ask whether AI is actually present in solutions that are on offer. The definition of AI compared to machine learning, for example, can be hazy and lead to users believing that they have an AI-based system when they do not.\n\nConversely, some solutions can be implemented without realising that AI is present: often the full explanation of what a solution is and does stops when a sale has been made. This can lead to incomplete discussions of \"what\u2019s under the bonnet\" and businesses not realising they are using AI-powered solutions.\n\n\"The more we ask questions about how it works and what it does, the more the suppliers will get used to being transparent and explaining what they do,\" according to Turner. \"And that will be better for everybody.\u201d\n\nIntroducing systems\n\nBeing impressed by AI\u2019s potential is one thing but making it work is another. While generative AI solutions for everyday tasks, such as writing emails and taking notes, can be used and assessed with ease, embedded AI that is used to deliver automation as well as decision-making (such as recruitment and resource management) can be problematic.\n\nAn organisation that opts into a solution without the full knowledge of how it work is open to accusations of bias if it does not operate fairly. It can be difficult to see if the technology is \"working\". There may be a long-run impact on the bottom line or recruitment, retention and equality measures but it is not enough simply to trust the technology to produce the right results.\n\nNew systems can be run in parallel with established ones to offer benchmarks. Businesses taking this approach can avoid experimenting and attain a real sense of what a system does and generate a plan of what a technology can contribute.\n\nThe people factor\n\nTechnology will deliver results only if people engage with its use. Agile workforces can maximise AI's benefits. With an increasingly aging population and workplaces that might span five generations, finding the right approach to connect workers with technology can be a challenge. Hence, learning agility is more important than ever. As people work longer, organisations need to ask how they bring in and develop sought-after skills.\n\nTechnology considerations are vital when systems are customer facing: a system that looks good but doesn\u2019t work or deliver value can be detrimental and lead to reputation damage. For HR, this would apply to recruitment, such as prospective candidates who have a bad experience sharing bad reviews. By using tech at the front end of business, an expectation is set for what customers or clients should expect.\n\n'Silos' versus 'lakes'\n\nOrganisations can struggle with data management. Data can stay within the operational silos in which it is created \u2013 unseen and inaccessible to other parts of the organisation. AI can push businesses forward by tapping into diverse data sets and identifying patterns and potentially profitable actions. This can move data from \"silos\" to \"lakes\" from which AI could draw \u2013 but this requires security and protections around the data.\n\nData protection laws need to be observed. Organisations need to be aware of both the value of data and where it can and cannot go. Pushing data into an AI solution can mean it leaves the organisation and becomes accessible potentially to others. This requires frameworks and guidelines.\n\n'Early years' work\n\nAI technology is likely to take over the \"low-hanging fruit\" of administrative work and have a significant impact on entry-level work and the early career structure of professions.\n\nThe removal of low- and entry-level work could lock out some from career paths and loss of the opportunity to learn a job \"from the bottom\" could mean a more limited funnel of talent to come into professions.\n\nHowever, the removal of mundane aspects of work could enable early-years workers to engage more fully with the job and its sector and to pick up more complex skills earlier, progress faster and make more significant contributions to the business.\n\nOsborne Clarke comment\n\nAttitudes towards the rapid evolution and adoption of AI can vary from the enthusiastic to the sceptical and even fearful. But there is a general recognition at senior levels that the clock can't be put back, transformation is coming and this requires figuring out what AI does and how to get on board.\n\nSchools are already taking the view that they are preparing children for jobs that currently do not exist, as AI radically changes industries and workplaces and creates new roles and dispenses with others. This will need to be managed and overseen by the HR function and requires engagement to understand, adapt to and prepare for transformation.\n\nHR will have a major role in this use and management of AI and to ensure skills and attitudes are matched by its safe and effective use. HR will have a role in creating and managing the new jobs and career paths for employees, with new expectations to manage and support. Guidance will also be required by managers and leaders in this technology-driven environment.\n\nThis is not, however, a task solely for HR. AI will touch every part of an organisation, Coherent strategies will be needed around AI's introduction and use. From system design and implementation to use and assessment, HR will need to work with all parts of an organisation to make AI work for everyone.\n\nThat will require teaching people how to use the technology and giving them frameworks \u2013safe ways of working that say \"we will use AI for this, but we will never use it for that\".\n\nThis Insight is based on a roundtable for leading HR professionals, \"AI in the Workplace \u2013 the Potential, the Pitfalls and the Risks\", which was hosted by The HR World, sponsored by international legal practice Osborne Clarke and led by Anna Elliott, Partner at Osborne Clarke and Sue Turner OBE, the founder of AI Governance.",

When used alongside human judgement, and in a responsible and ethical way, AI can enhance jobs and increase productivity,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Indusface research highlighted that four in five (80 per cent) professionals in Fortune 500 enterprises have used AI tools to assist with tasks such as analysing numbers, refining emails, reports and presentations.\n\nStriking a balance between AI and human judgement\n\nResearch from the University of Portsmouth also found that three in five (60 per cent) respondents would use AI to make managerial decisions, such as how much money employees earned.\n\nWolfgang Luhan, associate professor of behavioural economics and corresponding author of the study, said: \u201cOur research suggests that while people are open to the idea of algorithmic decision makers, especially for their potential for unbiased decisions, the actual performance and the ability to explain how they decide play crucial roles in acceptance.\u201d\n\nHe explained that, in moral decision-making contexts, the transparency and accountability of algorithms were vital. \u201cMany companies are already using AI for hiring decisions and compensation planning, and public bodies are employing AI in policing and parole strategies. Our findings suggest that, with improvements in algorithm consistency, the public may increasingly support algorithmic decision makers even in morally significant areas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the right AI approach is taken, this could actually improve the acceptance of policies and managerial choices such as pay rises or bonus payments.\u201d\n\nAshley Couto, AI trainer and consultant, said AI could free up the workforce to focus on tasks that need human judgement and creativity, and workers could use AI insights to make smarter decisions. \u201cWhen workers and AI work together, companies can get more done and create better results,\u201d she said.\n\nBridging the AI skills gap\n\nThe Indusface report found 11 per cent of data employees pasted into ChatGPT was strictly confidential, such as internal business strategies.\n\nTwo in five (38 per cent) professionals admitted to sharing personal data with AI platforms without their employer's permission.\n\nA further report by the European House Ambrosetti commissioned by IBM found AI adoption was hindered by a significant skills gap, with one third (33 per cent) of companies globally identifying it as the biggest barrier.\n\nThe report estimated that more than 43 million workers in the UK would need some sort of training in AI by 2030. Non-traditional pathways, such as online courses and digital credentials, would be favoured by 11 million of these workers.\n\nMohdzaini said: \u201cOrganisations have a responsibility to have clear guidelines in place and train people on AI as needed, to ensure that no one gets left behind. It\u2019s also essential for employers to monitor how technology is being used in their organisations and to help employees understand the risks involved.\"\n\nShe added that fostering a culture of \u201cexperimentation and shared learning\u201d could help employees develop their skills and become more comfortable using new technology.\n\nCouto highlighted the importance of investing in AI skills development, as teams worked better together when everyone shared a basic understanding of AI. She said it was cheaper and less risky to upskill than it was to turnover.\n\n\u201cTo bridge the AI skills gap, companies can make AI training part of employee development. Training works best when it's hands on and relates directly to people's jobs or a business\u2019s function,\u201d she explained.\n\nFind out more at the CIPD\u2019s Focus on: impact of AI and the world of work hub",

Photo: Shutterstock\n\nTheir comments echo growing global pushback against AI regulation, which this month led the UK and US to shun an ethical AI commitment enshrined in an international AI Action Statement whose 62 signatories include the likes of France, China, India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe US would prioritise \u201cpro-growth policies\u201d over safety, US vice president JD Vance said, warning that excessive regulation of AI could \u201ckill a transformative industry just as it\u2019s taking off\u2026. The Trump Administration will maintain a pro-worker growth path for AI.\u201d\n\nMcKellar voiced similar concerns, noting that \u201cAustralian businesses, already grappling with complex new industrial relations laws, do not need further burdensome workplace regulations.\u201d\n\nEmployees are learning to love AI\n\nBusiness groups\u2019 acrimonious response to proposed tightening of workplace AI rules \u2013 recommendations also include modernising legislation around employee workplace protections and reviewing awards for \u201chigh-risk industries\u201d \u2013 reflect growing tension around AI\u2019s proper role.\n\nA recent Deloitte study, which surveyed nearly 900 APAC business leaders across 13 countries, found that businesses weren\u2019t moving fast enough to improve their AI governance, with 91 percent of organisations found to have only \u2018basic\u2019 or \u2018in progress\u2019 governance structures.\n\nOne quarter of businesses experienced an increase in incidents related to AI over the past financial year, with 83 percent aware of AI-related risks around issues like surveillance and privacy, and 45 percent saying that improving AI governance had boosted their reputation among their customers.\n\nSignificantly, survey after survey suggests that Australian workers are generally OK with the use of AI during employment-related functions like recruitment, with the majority already using AI tools during their job searches and most similarly comfortable with employers using the technologies.\n\nOne recent Capterra survey of nearly 3,000 job seekers in 12 countries, for example, found that 64 percent of Australian job seekers believe they are more likely to be hired if AI is used in recruitment, and that 74 percent see AI as less biased than humans when evaluating candidates.\n\nMore job seekers were comfortable than uncomfortable with employers using AI and automation for sourcing, screening interviews, assessing skills, evaluating and ranking candidates, ensuring equal opportunity, and making hiring decisions \u2013 yet not all are ready to give AI carte blanche.\n\nTwo-thirds of job seekers said they were more likely to apply for a job if they have the option to talk to a human \u201cat any point in the application process,\u201d the survey found, while 59 percent are more likely to apply to a job description that states that all hiring decisions are made by humans.",

The researchers make what they call a \u201chighly speculative\u201d estimate that the technology assists from 0.5% to 3.5% of total work hours, suggesting that it may boost productivity between 0.125 percentage point to 0.875 percentage point.\n\nGauging the productivity boost is difficult in part because the technology has mushroomed so rapidly since the release of Chat GPT in November 2022.\n\nAfter two years, generative AI has achieved a 39.5% adoption rate, nearly double the 20% rate for the internet after two years and 20% for personal computers after three years, the researchers said in the NBER report.\n\nBy March 2024 the technology\u2019s most common \u201ctools had been accessed more than 3 billion times by hundreds of millions of users each month,\u201d the researchers said, citing a prior study.\n\nAmong 10 tasks raised by the researchers, AI is considered most helpful in writing, interpreting and administrative support. Yet all the tasks \u2014 including coding and interpreting and summarizing text or data \u2014 hit usage rates of at least 25%, they said.\n\n\u201cMy view is that AI, and generative AI in particular, is likely to become a general-purpose technology \u2014 one that spreads throughout the economy, sparks downstream innovation and continues to improve over time,\u201d Fed Governor Lisa Cook said in a speech Monday.\n\n\u201cAs firms deploy these technologies and workers discover ways to make use of them, such developments can create the conditions for greater productivity and thus higher wage growth consistent with stable prices,\u201d she said.\n\nFlagging a potential for gender inequality, the researchers said men are 9 percentage points more likely to use generative AI at work and 7 percentage points more likely to use it at home.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, PC adoption at work was more common for women, possibly because of the transition between typewriters and word processors and the high female share of secretaries and other administrative occupations,\u201d the researchers said.",

        "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword, it\u2019s a transformative force reshaping workplace culture. And organisational culture, the often invisible but potent force influencing behaviors and attitudes, is deeply impacted by the integration of AI. Although this technological evolution offers significant benefits, it also presents complex challenges that require careful navigation by business leaders and IT managers.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report reveals that companies are bracing for significant labor market changes, with a 23% job churn anticipated over the next four years due to the dual forces of job creation and role reduction. Technology-related roles, particularly those involving AI and machine learning, are expected to see the highest growth.\n\nReflecting the growing importance of AI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are projected to collectively invest around \u00a3158 billion in the sector, a 35% increase from 2023 levels, according to FactSet consensus. As AI becomes integral to corporate operations, its potential to enhance work experiences and efficiency is undeniable. However, the integration of AI technologies goes beyond operational benefits, fundamentally altering workplace culture and requiring a thoughtful approach to ensure smooth adoption and positive impact on the workforce.\n\nUnderstanding the impact of AI integration on workplace culture\n\nIn an era where the interaction between humans and AI is essential for competitiveness, organisations must now carefully consider how to integrate these technologies. Without proper leadership and communication, the introduction of AI can cause apprehension among employees.\n\nFor instance, some may fear that automation will replace their roles, seeing technology as a threat rather than an opportunity. This is especially true in contexts where the cost of living and job security are significant concerns. To counter these fears, it\u2019s essential to communicate the benefits of AI and automation clearly and inclusively. Leaders must ensure that all staff members understand how these technologies will be integrated and how their roles may evolve, highlighting that AI is a tool to enhance and not replace human capabilities.\n\nPreparing your workplace for AI and automation\n\nAt its core, AI integration fosters an environment of continuous learning and innovation. AI\u2019s ability to analyse vast amounts of data quickly and streamline routine tasks allows employees to focus on more strategic and creative endeavors that drive growth. However, this transition requires a culture that values data literacy, where employees across all departments can interpret AI-generated insights and apply them in their roles. And this transformation may lead to organisational changes, emphasising the importance of data analysis and cross-functional teamwork.\n\nAs more organisations continue to embrace AI-enabled tech in their workplace, it\u2019s crucial to clearly communicate how these technologies will enhance roles and support employee development, and to establish a central information hub to keep employees informed and prevent misunderstandings about implementation plans. Below are three essential steps to enhance workplace culture during this transition:\n\nRegular communication with staff \u2013 Engage in frequent discussions with staff, as employees highly value honesty, transparency, and empathy from their leaders during such transitions. These qualities are vital when explaining how AI and automation will positively impact their roles and support their professional growth.\n\nTo avoid the perception that new technology is being imposed on them, it\u2019s important to involve staff in the early stages of implementation plans, showing that their opinions are considered. Then, maintain ongoing communication, keep them updated on developments, and regularly seek feedback to identify opportunities for AI and automation use. This helps with turning tech implementation into a collaborative process rather than a top-down mandate.\n\nEmphasise the benefits \u2013 When encountering resistance or questions about AI implementation, focus on the benefits. Explain how these technologies will help employees complete tasks faster and more accurately, freeing up time for more important responsibilities. Some employees may be skeptical about the benefits of automation, so it\u2019s important to consistently highlight the long-term advantages they will experience.\n\nGiven the common fear that automation might eliminate or replace jobs, avoid using \u2018AI\u2019 or \u2018automation\u2019 as blanket terms. Instead provide detailed explanations of how these technologies will be implemented and how employees will continue to play a crucial role in the organisation\u2019s operations.\n\nCreate and communicate a technical training plan \u2013 There is often a digital divide in non-IT roles, which can lead to resistance towards technological changes. This is particularly relevant for roles that involve a lot of manual work, such as warehouse staff. Alleviate these concerns by presenting a clear training plan that shows how employees will develop the necessary skills to integrate technology into their roles.\n\nEmphasise that this is an opportunity for professional growth, turning what might seem like a daunting change into a positive prospect for skill development and career advancement.\n\nNavigating the road ahead with trust and growth\n\nAs organisations increasingly adopt AI technologies, it is crucial to maintain employee trust by addressing concerns, communicating transparently, and aligning AI initiatives with organisational values. While no single solution can tackle all the challenges of the modern workplace, a diverse approach is essential. This includes adopting flexible work practices and a commitment to upskilling, reskilling, and retaining talent in a rapidly evolving job market. Businesses should also implement the most effective tools to create sustainable value while investing in their employees\u2019 growth. By doing so, companies can ensure a more exceptional employee experience, positioning themselves to thrive in an increasingly competitive and technology-driven landscape.",

        "text": "With unemployment on the rise and artificial intelligence reshaping workplaces, there is growing anxiety among workers about job security and the relevance of current skills.\n\nWhile AI may be viewed as a relentless force, I believe it also presents an incredible opportunity for personal and professional growth. Those who understand and harness its potential stand to gain significantly in a growing AI-driven economy.\n\nThat\u2019s why workers and leaders must adapt together so they and their companies stay competitive. That\u2019s especially true as AI barrels through industries more forcefully than ever in 2025, two years after ChatGPT set off an arms race in the corporate world with the use of chatbots for ad targeting, content creation and other tasks.\n\nIt\u2019s imperative that employees care about AI and its potential, and therefore stay ahead of the disruption that it\u2019s likely to cause. As for HR and business leaders, it\u2019s their duty to balance automation and human skills.\n\nLeaders should be championing AI literacy across all levels of the organization by investing in training programs, creating cross-functional teams to foster innovation, and establishing AI committees to guide responsible use. Smart executives create a continuous culture of learning, helping employees keep up with a steep learning curve that comes with any new technology. Education will help companies and workers navigate this shift.\n\n5 skills for 2025\n\nI\u2019ve been urging industry leaders to focus on helping workers develop five essential skills that will be needed to thrive in an AI-enhanced economy. My approach is rooted in finding a balance between leveraging AI for its strengths and emphasizing human qualities that machines can\u2019t replicate. These skills can be taught and reinforced with forethought and determination.\n\n1. Technical proficiency\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into workplaces, workers need a foundational understanding of AI tools and data literacy. These skills enable effective collaboration with AI systems, enhancing their decision-making processes. Companies should invest in targeted training, like workshops on machine learning and data visualization, and encourage hands-on experience through internal AI-driven projects. It\u2019s important to know that AI\u2019s capabilities will only accelerate, so employees can\u2019t stumble at the starting gate.\n\n2. Adaptability\n\nThis is something that needs to be ingrained in the workforce of the future. To stay relevant, workers must adopt a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability. Employers can support this by encouraging job rotations, new project assignments or role expansions that stretch employees\u2019 skills and push them out of their comfort zones. Adaptability workshops and change management training can also prepare teams for future shifts.\n\n3. Creativity\n\nIn a world where AI handles data and routine tasks, human creativity becomes a differentiator. And it is human creativity that remains essential to faster innovation, which gives companies a competitive edge. Employers can unlock workers\u2019 creativity by starting with simple exercises such as regular brainstorming sessions or more cross-departmental projects. It\u2019s not just about getting the work done; it\u2019s figuring out new ways to do it better, faster and more economically. AI will be key to achieving those goals in partnership with humans. It should boost worker productivity and engagement, too.\n\n4. Emotional intelligence\n\nAI can handle technical tasks, but it can\u2019t replicate the human ability to understand and manage emotions. Empathy, active listening and clear communication are crucial for team dynamics and customer relationships. Organizations can enhance these skills through training programs focused on empathy exercises, conflict resolution and effective communication. Encouraging a culture where feedback is constructive and emotions are managed positively will help bridge the gap between human and AI interactions.\n\n5. Ethical judgment and integrity\n\nWith AI influencing decisions that impact people\u2019s lives, ethical considerations become paramount. Workers must understand the ethical implications of AI, from data privacy to bias in algorithms. Companies should provide ethics training, host discussions on real-world ethical dilemmas, and establish AI ethics committees to review and guide AI-related decisions. Promoting a culture of integrity ensures AI\u2019s use aligns with both corporate and societal principles.\n\nHow to develop skills\n\nDeveloping these skills is a shared responsibility among workers, employers and educational institutions. Workers must take the initiative to learn and adapt by, for example, using online resources, volunteering for AI-related projects within their organizations or participating in affinity groups.\n\nEmployers, in turn, should provide access to training resources, support skills development and foster a culture of continuous learning. This has taken on additional importance as a greater share of companies are embracing skills-based, as opposed to credential-centered, hiring. In fact, a recent survey of 3,000 international workers indicated that 73% of employers used skills-based hiring last year, up from 56% in 2022. This trend underscores the need for continuous skill development over traditional credentialing.\n\nEducational institutions, for their part, should be prepared to change up their curricula to reflect this new workplace reality, offering programs that focus on both technical and human-centric skills. They ought to consider continuous forms of teaching rather than traditional term-based classes, among other changes.\n\nRather than fearing AI as a job-stealing force, let\u2019s view it as a catalyst for human advancement. By doubling down on what makes us uniquely human\u2014our creativity, empathy and ethical judgment\u2014we can shape a future where AI enhances our work, fuels innovation and unlocks new levels of growth and opportunity.",

        "text": "Workforces may be having an issue with AI overkill.\n\nAbout half of business leaders report declining company-wide enthusiasm for AI integration and adoption, according to a recent EY pulse survey, including responses from 500 senior business executives.\n\nThe findings speak to general exhaustion with constant change in the workplace following the pandemic, with the return to offices, hybrid work and now the integration of new and potentially transformative technology. And that\u2019s extending to all levels of organizations. In EY\u2019s survey, over half of company leaders said they feel they are failing in their role amid AI\u2019s rapid growth.\n\n\u201cThe primary driver of AI fatigue is the intense focus on adoption over the past year, coupled with uncertainty around how the technology will impact employees and the rapid pace of its implementation,\u201d said Dan Diasio, EY global artificial intelligence consulting leader.\n\n\u201cAs companies push forward with AI integration, many are facing mounting challenges related to employee disengagement,\u201d Diasio said.\n\n\u201cThe primary driver of AI fatigue is the intense focus on adoption over the past year, coupled with uncertainty around how the technology will impact employees and the rapid pace of its implementation.\" Dan Diasio global artificial intelligence consulting leader, EY\n\nOne problem is that many workers are finding the tools don\u2019t make them more productive. Almost 80% of workers who use generative AI in their jobs said it has added to their workload and is hampering their productivity, as they spend more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content, an Upwork survey of over 2,500 full-time workers, freelancers and executives found.\n\nIn that same survey, 96% of executives said they expect AI to boost productivity, while about 40% of staff said they don\u2019t know how that will ever happen.\n\nIn some cases, AI tools have been initially rolled out then scaled back following concerns from legal teams, said Emily Rose McRae, senior director analyst at Gartner. \u201cYou have tools that might have been useful that people are now being told not to use, which then decreases enthusiasm for the entire category,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother major problem is a lack of training on using new AI tools properly. From 2023 to 2024, the number of employees who said they feel very prepared to work with AI dropped by six percentage points, according to a report from Gallup. Some 40% of employees said they are struggling to understand how to integrate AI into their work, and 75% said they lack confidence in how to utilize AI, another report, from Wiley, found.\n\n\u201cAs AI is still a new tool for many, it\u2019s essential for companies to prioritize communication, transparency, and education to alleviate these concerns. By focusing on human-centered design, leaders can help employees better understand their role and potential benefits, fostering a more engaged workforce,\u201d Diasio said.\n\n\u201cYou have tools that might have been useful that people are now being told not to use, which then decreases enthusiasm for the entire category.\" Emily Rose McRae, senior director analyst at Gartner.\n\nAnd employers are making some progress in this area. According to EY, 59% of senior leaders are investing in expanding training on the responsible use of AI over the next year \u2014 up from 49% six months ago.\n\n\u201cWhile this is a positive step, addressing AI fatigue requires a comprehensive approach that emphasizes clear communication, continuous learning, and reassurances about the long-term value of the technology,\u201d Diasio said.\n\nWhen it comes to AI in the coming year, HR leaders will \u201cneed to navigate issues with data, best practices for usage, identifying skills gaps for those unfamiliar with the technology and change fatigue that happens when there is so much transformation happening within a small period of time,\u201d said Constanze Backhaus, CHRO at TeamViewer, a remote access software company.",

        "text": "AI Adoption Among Employers and Employees\n\nThe data reveals a notable difference in AI adoption between employers and employees. While 88% of employers use AI at work, only 71% of employees do the same. This disparity suggests that while leadership recognizes the value of AI, there may be barriers or resistance among the broader workforce. Addressing these barriers is crucial for maximizing AI's potential.\n\nAI in HR: Transforming Human-Centric Tasks\n\nAI's influence extends to HR functions traditionally characterized by human interaction. A striking 66% of US workers use AI for HR-specific tasks, including payroll processing, benefits administration and interpersonal queries. This shift highlights AI's capability to help streamline processes, reduce manual errors and enhance employee experience, aligning with evolving payroll trends that are transforming workforce management. For example, AI can help automate payroll processing, ensuring better accuracy and freeing HR professionals to focus on strategic initiatives.\n\nUnderstanding the Acceptance Gap\n\nDespite the widespread use of AI, there is a notable acceptance gap between employers and employees regarding its application. For instance, 59% of employers approve of AI use for benefits-related queries at a moderate or extremely acceptable level, while only 41% of employees use it almost every time or more. Similarly, for personal HR questions, 49% of employers back AI, compared to just 35% of employees. This gap underscores the need for businesses to build trust and demonstrate the value of AI to their workforce.\n\nBuilding Trust in AI\n\nTrust is a critical factor in AI adoption. Employees may be wary of AI due to concerns about job security, privacy and the reliability of AI-driven decisions. To build trust, business owners and HR decision makers should consider focusing on transparency, communication and education. Clearly explain how AI tools work, the benefits they offer and how they will be integrated into existing workflows. Providing training and support can also help employees feel more comfortable and confident in using AI tools.\n\nPreferences for AI Vs. Human Interaction\n\nInterestingly, one in three US workers prefer consulting an AI assistant over a real human interaction. The reasons for this preference include quicker responses (cited by 45% of employers and 50% of employees), seems easier (41% of employers, 39% of employees) and privacy concerns(42% of employers, 36% of employees). Additional reasons can include greater reliability, avoiding office politics and bypassing personal bias. These insights highlight the potential of AI to improve the workplace experience by addressing common points associated with human interactions.\n\nLeveraging AI for Improved Employee Experience\n\nBy understanding the reasons behind employees' preference for AI, businesses can tailor their AI solutions to meet these needs. For instance, implementing AI chatbots for quick responses to common queries can enhance efficiency and satisfaction. AI-driven platforms that support data privacy and unbiased decision-making can also foster a more inclusive and supportive work environment.\n\nActionable Recommendations for Business Owners and HR Decision Makers\n\nTo effectively harness AI in the workplace and bridge the acceptance gap, business owners and HR decision makers should consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Promote AI Education and Training\n\nInvesting in AI education and training for employees is crucial. Provide comprehensive training programs that cover the basics of AI, its applications and its benefits. This will help demystify AI and empower employees to use AI tools confidently.\n\n2. Enhance Communication and Transparency\n\nMaintain open lines of communication about AI initiatives. Clearly articulate the purpose, benefits and safeguards associated with AI tools. Address any concerns or misconceptions promptly and transparently.\n\n3. Foster a Collaborative Approach\n\nInvolve employees in the AI integration process. Seek their input and feedback on AI tools and applications. A collaborative approach can help identify potential issues early and build a sense of ownership and acceptance among employees.\n\n4. Ensure Ethical AI Use\n\nImplement ethical guidelines for AI use to ensure fairness, transparency and accountability. Regularly audit AI systems to identify and mitigate any biases or unintended consequences.\n\n5. Focus on Augmentation, Not Replacement\n\nEmphasize that AI is intended to augment human capabilities, not replace them. Highlight how AI can handle repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their roles.\n\n6. Leverage AI for Personalized Employee Support\n\nUse AI to provide personalized support to employees. AI-driven platforms can offer tailored recommendations for professional development, wellness programs and career growth opportunities.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe integration of AI into the workplace presents significant opportunities for small and medium-size businesses. By understanding the current landscape of AI adoption, addressing the acceptance gap and implementing targeted strategies, business owners and HR decision makers can harness AI to enhance efficiency, improve employee satisfaction and drive business success. As AI continues to evolve, businesses that proactively embrace and adapt to this technological shift can better position themselves to thrive in the future of work.",

        "text": "Now is the time for upskilling workforces for AI and for organisations to benefit from the 'commoditisation' of work\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) offers many benefits to organisations, from taking away low-hanging administrative tasks to allowing employees to be repositioned to add greater value. And, within HR, AI can offers a wide range of solutions from scheduling or carrying out recruitment to performance assessments and monitoring employee wellbeing.\n\nBut the knowledge and opinions about AI's vary widely despite its growth in the workplace and on the HR agenda. While some organisations are already engaging with AI-driven solutions, such as ChaptGPT and \"sandboxes\", others are trying to find ways to use the technology appropriately.\n\nUnderstand the risks\n\nAI brings a range of risks that HR professionals need to understand. It can reinforce discrimination in biased data. It can pose issues around intellectual property, such as the use of other people\u2019s material to develop an AI solution without their consent. It can potentially deskill workforces. And AI can raise issues around who creates and owns complications arising from its use.\n\nThere is ongoing government-level legislative and regulatory activity, but this presently involves more discussion than implementation. Organisations wanting to take advantage of the evolving technology will need to be ready to adapt and be flexible when and as rules are introduced.\n\nEducation and experience\n\nEmployers will encounter a range of issues as they adopt AI. Speaking at a recent Osborne Clarke AI event Sue Turner, founder director of AI Governance, a UK business consultancy, emphasised the need for executive education for leaders of organisations to understand what AI is, what it can do and, particularly, the ethical issues it raises.\n\nWhen AI is introduced into an organisation, its leaders need to understand systems or approaches to mitigate risks in order to get the full value from the technology. Employers are exploring the introduction of frameworks to govern the use and development of AI. Although this can be at the cost of innovation and efficiencies, employers are looking to find the right policies to encourage the adoption and use of AI without exposing themselves to greater risks.\n\nThere has been a proliferation of AI \"claimed to be\" solutions touted to employers and, in particular, HR, according to Turner. The growing uptake of AI means that third-party suppliers need to be challenged over what their AI does and what data has been built on. \"You need to know enough about what AI is doing to ask if this right for your organisation\" she said. \"You should ask: is the science behind it real?\u201d\n\nIs it or isn't it AI?\n\nOrganisations need to ask whether AI is actually present in solutions that are on offer. The definition of AI compared to machine learning, for example, can be hazy and lead to users believing that they have an AI-based system when they do not.\n\nConversely, some solutions can be implemented without realising that AI is present: often the full explanation of what a solution is and does stops when a sale has been made. This can lead to incomplete discussions of \"what\u2019s under the bonnet\" and businesses not realising they are using AI-powered solutions.\n\n\"The more we ask questions about how it works and what it does, the more the suppliers will get used to being transparent and explaining what they do,\" according to Turner. \"And that will be better for everybody.\u201d\n\nIntroducing systems\n\nBeing impressed by AI\u2019s potential is one thing but making it work is another. While generative AI solutions for everyday tasks, such as writing emails and taking notes, can be used and assessed with ease, embedded AI that is used to deliver automation as well as decision-making (such as recruitment and resource management) can be problematic.\n\nAn organisation that opts into a solution without the full knowledge of how it work is open to accusations of bias if it does not operate fairly. It can be difficult to see if the technology is \"working\". There may be a long-run impact on the bottom line or recruitment, retention and equality measures but it is not enough simply to trust the technology to produce the right results.\n\nNew systems can be run in parallel with established ones to offer benchmarks. Businesses taking this approach can avoid experimenting and attain a real sense of what a system does and generate a plan of what a technology can contribute.\n\nThe people factor\n\nTechnology will deliver results only if people engage with its use. Agile workforces can maximise AI's benefits. With an increasingly aging population and workplaces that might span five generations, finding the right approach to connect workers with technology can be a challenge. Hence, learning agility is more important than ever. As people work longer, organisations need to ask how they bring in and develop sought-after skills.\n\nTechnology considerations are vital when systems are customer facing: a system that looks good but doesn\u2019t work or deliver value can be detrimental and lead to reputation damage. For HR, this would apply to recruitment, such as prospective candidates who have a bad experience sharing bad reviews. By using tech at the front end of business, an expectation is set for what customers or clients should expect.\n\n'Silos' versus 'lakes'\n\nOrganisations can struggle with data management. Data can stay within the operational silos in which it is created \u2013 unseen and inaccessible to other parts of the organisation. AI can push businesses forward by tapping into diverse data sets and identifying patterns and potentially profitable actions. This can move data from \"silos\" to \"lakes\" from which AI could draw \u2013 but this requires security and protections around the data.\n\nData protection laws need to be observed. Organisations need to be aware of both the value of data and where it can and cannot go. Pushing data into an AI solution can mean it leaves the organisation and becomes accessible potentially to others. This requires frameworks and guidelines.\n\n'Early years' work\n\nAI technology is likely to take over the \"low-hanging fruit\" of administrative work and have a significant impact on entry-level work and the early career structure of professions.\n\nThe removal of low- and entry-level work could lock out some from career paths and loss of the opportunity to learn a job \"from the bottom\" could mean a more limited funnel of talent to come into professions.\n\nHowever, the removal of mundane aspects of work could enable early-years workers to engage more fully with the job and its sector and to pick up more complex skills earlier, progress faster and make more significant contributions to the business.\n\nOsborne Clarke comment\n\nAttitudes towards the rapid evolution and adoption of AI can vary from the enthusiastic to the sceptical and even fearful. But there is a general recognition at senior levels that the clock can't be put back, transformation is coming and this requires figuring out what AI does and how to get on board.\n\nSchools are already taking the view that they are preparing children for jobs that currently do not exist, as AI radically changes industries and workplaces and creates new roles and dispenses with others. This will need to be managed and overseen by the HR function and requires engagement to understand, adapt to and prepare for transformation.\n\nHR will have a major role in this use and management of AI and to ensure skills and attitudes are matched by its safe and effective use. HR will have a role in creating and managing the new jobs and career paths for employees, with new expectations to manage and support. Guidance will also be required by managers and leaders in this technology-driven environment.\n\nThis is not, however, a task solely for HR. AI will touch every part of an organisation, Coherent strategies will be needed around AI's introduction and use. From system design and implementation to use and assessment, HR will need to work with all parts of an organisation to make AI work for everyone.\n\nThat will require teaching people how to use the technology and giving them frameworks \u2013safe ways of working that say \"we will use AI for this, but we will never use it for that\".\n\nThis Insight is based on a roundtable for leading HR professionals, \"AI in the Workplace \u2013 the Potential, the Pitfalls and the Risks\", which was hosted by The HR World, sponsored by international legal practice Osborne Clarke and led by Anna Elliott, Partner at Osborne Clarke and Sue Turner OBE, the founder of AI Governance.",

Similarly, fewer women, older workers and manual or clerical workers felt technology is changing their roles for the better.\n\nYet not all workers are equally benefiting from AI. Younger workers, men, and senior management are more likely to use AI at work and enjoy experimenting with AI, compared to women, over 55, and manual or clerical workers. Similarly, fewer women, older workers and manual or clerical workers felt technology is changing their roles for the better. Lack of Guidance: Workers also felt clearer guidance is needed around use of AI in the workplace, with 69% feeling clear AI policies are still needed \u2013 while one in three (33%) think the use of AI in the workplace should be banned entirely. Interestingly, one in four (25%) workers admit to using AI without their boss's knowledge.\n\n\"Each technological leap \u2013 such as we are currently experiencing with AI \u2013 does change the workplace,\" explains Graham Glass, Founder and CEO, CYPHER Learning. \"Trade-offs have had to be made throughout history as jobs and roles shift. But over the long term these changes generally prove to be for the better.\"\n\nMichael Rochelle, Chief Strategy Officer and Principal HCM Analyst at Brandon Hall Group adds: \"Artificial intelligence is not just about automation\u2014it's about augmentation. Brandon Hall Group research underscores AI's ability to enhance the workforce by freeing employees from mundane tasks and empowering them to focus on more strategic, creative endeavors. The true value of AI lies in its ability to enrich the employee experience and provide actionable insights that elevate organizational performance. CYPHER Learning's report highlights a key issue: all employees should have the opportunity to benefit from training and support to maximize AI's value in the workforce.\"\n\nWith the influence of AI on the workforce expected to grow in the coming years, 73% of workers believe AI skills will be important to their role within five years \u2013 with 45% believing such skills will be 'essential' or 'very important'. However, only 25% have had training in this area. Again, workforce divides were apparent:\n\nOnly 11% of workers over 55 have had AI training, compared to 30% of those aged 18 to 44.\n\nMore men than women report exposure to AI training \u2013 36% compared to 18%.\n\nSenior management have had more training than anyone else \u2013 58%, compared to 11% of clerical or manual workers.\n\nThe survey also revealed frustrations and concerns around how technology training is delivered at present. Nearly half of workers (48%) worry about their company's future due to a lack of leadership investment in new technology skills. Moreover, 46% of workers said they find it impossible to keep up with the tech and digital skills required for their roles, and 53% say their tech training quickly becomes outdated.\n\n\"As AI increasingly permeates the workplace, fostering a culture of continuous learning through training and education will be essential to boost worker confidence,\" Glass concludes. \"Some workers may feel overwhelmed by technology when training is not delivered in a way that is relevant to them and their role. For example, helping people understand the purpose of AI, and how to assess and validate outputs, will be more useful to some workers than extensive training in prompt engineering. When training is delivered in ways applicable to each individual and their role, at the right time in the right context, it's more likely to help them progress.\"\n\nFindings are detailed in the new CYPHER Learning report: Bridging The AI Digital Divide\n\nAbout CYPHER LEARNING\n\nCYPHER Learning exists to give learners the power to succeed in a rapidly changing world.

        "text": "Dive Brief:\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence has spread throughout the U.S. workplace and across a broad range of professions since its debut less than two years ago, with 28% of workers now using the technology on the job, according to a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nTwenty-four percent of workers use generative AI at least once each week and one out of every nine turn to it daily, researchers said in what they call the first survey gauging the extent of the technology\u2019s use in the U.S. workplace and home.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI adoption is most common in management, business and computer occupations, with usage rates exceeding 40%,\u201d according to the researchers, including an economic policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cStill, one in five \u2018blue collar\u2019 workers and one in five workers without a college degree use generative AI regularly on the job as well.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMeasuring gains in U.S. productivity from generative AI has so far proven challenging. The researchers make what they call a \u201chighly speculative\u201d estimate that the technology assists from 0.5% to 3.5% of total work hours, suggesting that it may boost productivity between 0.125 percentage point to 0.875 percentage point.\n\nGauging the productivity boost is difficult in part because the technology has mushroomed so rapidly since the release of Chat GPT in November 2022.\n\nAfter two years, generative AI has achieved a 39.5% adoption rate, nearly double the 20% rate for the internet after two years and 20% for personal computers after three years, the researchers said in the NBER report.\n\nBy March 2024 the technology\u2019s most common \u201ctools had been accessed more than 3 billion times by hundreds of millions of users each month,\u201d the researchers said, citing a prior study.\n\nAmong 10 tasks raised by the researchers, AI is considered most helpful in writing, interpreting and administrative support. Yet all the tasks \u2014 including coding and interpreting and summarizing text or data \u2014 hit usage rates of at least 25%, they said.\n\n\u201cMy view is that AI, and generative AI in particular, is likely to become a general-purpose technology \u2014 one that spreads throughout the economy, sparks downstream innovation and continues to improve over time,\u201d Fed Governor Lisa Cook said in a speech Monday.\n\n\u201cAs firms deploy these technologies and workers discover ways to make use of them, such developments can create the conditions for greater productivity and thus higher wage growth consistent with stable prices,\u201d she said.\n\nFlagging a potential for gender inequality, the researchers said men are 9 percentage points more likely to use generative AI at work and 7 percentage points more likely to use it at home.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, PC adoption at work was more common for women, possibly because of the transition between typewriters and word processors and the high female share of secretaries and other administrative occupations,\u201d the researchers said.",

        "text": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nHR Dive reporter Caroline Colvin takes up the mantle for the Talent Textbook series. Most recently, they asked HR experts about the difference between time to hire and time to fill.\n\nHave you ever wondered about your workplace\u2019s policy for something and didn\u2019t know where to find it? Then you ask your manager, then your manager has to ask their manager and then it gets escalated to HR. Or maybe you are HR, and you\u2019re tired of answering the same baseline questions over and over again.\n\nThis and similar situations has brought a new use case for AI at work to the forefront: enterprise search.\n\nHow artificial intelligence may save HR, workers time\n\nEnterprise search refers to any kind of tech solution that helps workers find the information they need within their enterprise. Think workplace policies such as parental leave or meeting protocols, or the details of a worker\u2019s benefits package, financial information and vacation time.\n\nNow, add AI on top of that to make it all the more convenient.\n\nWhen I attended the company\u2019s annual conference in November 2024, Dayforce debuted its AI agent. Now, Google just debuted Agentspace following the launch of Gemini 2.0. Next up is Cisco Webex, which has beta tested the technology with a handful of customers and piloted the software on its own staff ahead of a February 2025 release to the public.\n\nA screenshot of the Cisco Webex Agent. Cisco Webex\n\nManoj Muthavarapu, a director of product management at Cisco, not only worked on developing the Webex AI Agent capabilities for the past eight or nine years, but also has used the agent, called Kate during trials, in tangible ways.\n\n\u201cI have a team member who recently had a baby. My manager and I were on a call. They were wondering what we could do as a nice gesture, of sending a gift,\u201d Muthavarapu told HR Dive.\n\n\u201cNow, normally for a question like that, I would have asked my manager. He would have maybe checked with a couple of people, and then I would have then spoken to HR or raised a support case, and then something would have eventually come back to me as an answer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018Let's just ask Kate.\u2019 Within 30 seconds, we discovered that any new parents can go to the portal and just order a baby gift bag within X number of days of having a baby,\u201d he said, adding that he was able to pass along the info to the new parent on his team.\n\n\n\nAlong with providing answers to questions, some AI agents, such as that from Dayforce, even have the workplace policy PDF attached to the answers that the chatbot gives. Having seen a variety of software in this space, I can see how scenarios such as Muthavarapu\u2019s could become the norm within organizations.\n\nHR has used this technology for a while\n\nFrom machine learning to generative AI, artificial intelligence in HR is beyond a hot topic. Where and how can AI agents be used in hiring? Are there compliance issues if you do so? Do you create an ethics policy for workplace generative AI use? How can HR use AI to cut down on dreaded menial tasks?\n\nMicrosoft positioned its 365 suite\u2019s Copilot in 2023 as a means to \u201cremove the drudgery of work.\u201d Slack also debuted an AI component last year and continued to add and improve app integrations this year.\n\nEarlier this year, one tech CPO told HR Dive that HR is \u201cjust scratching the surface\u201d of leveraging AI for work \u2014 and surely the deluge of new software, new use cases and new questions will keep on coming.\n\nBut a gap seems to exist between business leaders\u2019 understanding and adoption of AI, and confidence in their skills. For example, more than half of vice presidents and directors from the U.S. and U.K. surveyed said that they have never attended an AI-related training.\n\nIn the same December 2024 report, less than half said they feel confident in how to use AI without compromising company data and 27% said they are not very or not at all confident in their abilities.\n\nNathan Mondragon, chief innovation officer at HireVue, told HR Dive that many people in the space are probably using AI and may not even know it.\n\n\u201cA lot of HR professionals are using it to facilitate their day-to-day jobs, [such as] streamlining and clarifying their writing,\u201d Mondragon said. He also noted that some HR professionals are using AI to create work assessments and screening tools.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the sky's the limit at this point in time,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile AI use at work is not without challenges, it\u2019s clearly here to stay in 2025 \u2014 no matter where a company or employee stands on AI. If this technology is to become ubiquitous, HR has an opportunity to make good use of it.",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool with sweeping implications for the U.S. workforce, but it\u2019s up to society to guide how it is used. A new report(opens in new window) by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on the impact of AI on the workforce emphasizes how humans \u2014 making informed choices, investing in training and creating fair policies \u2014 must shape a future where AI benefits everyone.\n\n\u201cChange is coming, but it\u2019s really hard to predict exactly what and when,\u201d said Tom Mitchell(opens in new window), Founders University Professor in the Machine Learning Department in Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s School of Computer Science(opens in new window), who co-chaired the report\u2019s study committee. \u201cGiven that, we feel that one of the prudent things to do is to at least put some effort into thinking about: \u2018What if?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe report, requested by Congress as part of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, examines how AI is likely to complement or replace human labor, reshape job markets, and influence workforce dynamics. It emphasizes that AI should be used to enhance human well-being, augment collective capabilities and support a well-equipped future workforce.\n\nThe report lays out several scenarios to help guide research and policymaking, emphasizing that the beneficial deployment of AI to enhance human labor, complement expertise and create new forms of valuable work is not an inevitable outcome, but will require intentional design.\n\nWill AI improve productivity?\n\n\u201cProductivity isn\u2019t everything, but it\u2019s been said it\u2019s almost everything. It\u2019s really the thing that, more than anything else, drives our long term living standard. It\u2019s what determines the health of nations,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab and co-chair of the study committee with Mitchell.\n\nBrynjolfsson said productivity comes from general purpose technologies that are pervasive, improve over time and spawn complementary innovations. Like the steam engine or electricity, AI is a general purpose technology.\n\nSubstantial and continuing improvements in AI\u2019s capabilities, paired with its broad applicability and capacity to drive further innovations, promise significant improvements to productivity. But realizing those benefits \u2014 and ensuring they are shared equally \u2014 will require investment in training, fair policies and changes to business processes and organization, the report says.\n\n\"We are already seeing productivity gains in certain areas such as software development and customer relationship management,\" said Mitchell. \"But many of these gains will require that workers learn to use new AI tools effectively. Providing workers with retraining opportunities, and keeping them informed of shifting demands for different skills, will be essential to assuring that the workforce benefits from advancing AI technology, and that the new wealth generated from these advances is shared widely.\"\n\nThe report calls for the government to speed and share the productivity benefits of AI by sharing data on what works and what does not; supporting research on policies that could help workers change jobs, locations or industries to take advantage of new opportunities; and supporting research into legal and ethical issues like product safety, privacy and bias.\n\nHow AI will drive supply and demand for education\n\nAI will have significant implications for education at all levels: driving the demand for education in response to shifting job requirements and driving the supply of education as AI provides opportunities to make learning more personalized, engaging and cost-effective.\n\n\u201cAlready we\u2019re seeing the use of AI in online educational environments,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cThere are multiple kindergarten(opens in new window) through 12th grade educational online systems that serve millions of students and use AI to learn from that teaching experience how to teach better. We\u2019re also seeing many experiments, such as Kahnmigo from Kahn Academy, exploring how to use the new conversational capabilities of LLMs to provide more direct, personal tutoring to students.\u201d\n\nThe report details how public and private investments in resources like high-speed internet access and teacher training can help ensure AI benefits education equitably.\n\nEmpowering workers through rapid change\n\nThe report suggests that AI will impact jobs by reshaping demand for different types of human expertise, making some types less valuable and others more valuable. This in turn can lead to changes in salaries and even to entirely new jobs requiring expertise people have not yet considered.",

        "text": "Key points What separates AI from old-fashioned computer programs is its ability to learn, adapt and respond with some degree of autonomy.\n\nSafety and health-related aspects of AI include robotic exoskeletons that help prevent musculoskeletal injuries among workers doing heavy lifting and virtual-reality safety training.\n\nBarriers to implementation include cost, quality of data and pushback from workers.\n\nEver since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, the buzz around artificial intelligence has built to a fever pitch. The possibilities of AI seem boundless, inspiring reactions ranging from awestruck optimism to apocalyptic nightmares (especially after hundreds of technology leaders signed a public statement in May 2023 warning of AI\u2019s existential threat to humanity).\n\nThe truth is, AI isn\u2019t a single tool \u2013 it\u2019s a general-purpose technological advancement along the lines of electricity or the internet, with similarly world-changing potential, says Cam Stevens, CEO of the Pocketknife Group, a consultancy focused on the intersection between technology and workplace safety.\n\n\u201cAI is an umbrella term that describes a field of computing that\u2019s dedicated to creating systems that are capable of performing tasks that would normally require some form of human intelligence,\u201d Stevens explains. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the technology mega-trends that are shaping the future of work.\u201d\n\nThat includes the future of workplace safety.\n\nHow is AI being used now?\n\nWhat separates AI from old-fashioned computer programs is its ability to learn, adapt and respond with some degree of autonomy.\n\nStill, AI isn\u2019t really new. For decades before ChatGPT blew up, AI was quietly helping us plan driving routes with GPS, guarding our smartphones with facial or fingerprint recognition, and cleaning up our spelling in texts and emails.\n\nBut in recent years, advances and investment in AI have led professionals in every field, including occupational safety and health, to explore how the technology could revolutionize their work.\n\nThe result has been a profusion of innovative health and safety applications \u2013 from robotic exoskeletons that help prevent musculoskeletal injuries and smart helmets that can monitor vital signs and working conditions, to virtual-reality safety training. But at the moment, most of these applications are still in the experimental stage or in small-scale use.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of promise in the emerging technologies area, but generative AI is what everyone has access to and is the primary form used in the workplace,\u201d says Jay Vietas, chief of the Emerging Technologies Branch at NIOSH. \u201cYou can ask it to write a health and safety plan for your area. You can ask it to tell you what the risks are with respect to electrical safety or how to design a lockout/tagout program, for example.\n\n\u201cYou could argue that it\u2019s just a Google search on steroids. However, we still need safety and health professionals to go back and evaluate what has been provided to you to ensure it\u2019s appropriate and applicable to your particular area.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s on the horizon?\n\nOther AI applications that Stevens sees coming into wider use are computer vision and natural language processing.\n\nComputer vision can take advantage of existing closed-circuit TV cameras to monitor safe working practices and alert workers to hazards, such as potential human-forklift interactions on a factory floor.\n\n\u201cWe train machine learning algorithms, which are basically identifying the same patterns that we as humans would be looking for, but without us needing to be there,\u201d Stevens says. \u201cMachine learning algorithms can be applied across thousands of hours of footage, identify patterns and then provide us with insights that we can then use to take action.\u201d\n\nNatural language processing has a wide range of uses that could be helpful to safety pros, such as recording meetings or coaching conversations \u2013 with consent, of course \u2013 and summarizing, taking notes, interpreting the tone and dynamics of the interactions, or providing translation on the spot.\n\n\u201cThe ability to have real-time language translation of health and safety or work-based information, typically using a smartphone, is critically important for organizations that have a multilingual workforce,\u201d Stevens says.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the future?\n\nPotential uses of AI in safety are so wide ranging that they\u2019re hard to predict. \u201cIt was very difficult to say exactly how you were going to use the internet when it first came out,\u201d Stevens notes.\n\nHe likes to think future AI solutions will empower individual workers to receive \u201chyper-personalized\u201d safety training in whatever form optimizes their learning (a Spanish-language comic book, for example) and make well-informed safety decisions.\n\n\u201cI think the real power will be when we start getting artificial intelligence solutions in the hands of frontline workers,\u201d Stevens says, \u201cwhere we can support them to obtain the right information at the right time so that their decision-making is augmented with everything they need at their fingertips.\u201d\n\nWhat are some barriers and risks?\n\nAI has dozens of safety applications, \u201cranging from quicker and better analysis of worksite conditions, ergonomics, hazards and so on \u2013 all the way to continuous monitoring of and adjustment to the work interface and daily decision-making,\u201d says John Dony, vice president of workplace strategy at the National Safety Council.\n\nSo, what barriers and risks stand between safety pros and all of this potential?\n\nCost: One of the reasons generative AI is so commonly used among safety pros is that it\u2019s typically either low cost or free, Vietas says. The issue isn\u2019t only the monetary cost of other AI tools, but also the resources needed to program, customize and implement them, as well as train workers on their use.\n\n\u201cBut as the computer power continues to increase, and then with the amount of investment happening in artificial intelligence systems, I believe the cost (of the other AI tools) will become more reasonable in the near future,\u201d Vietas claims.\n\nLack of high-quality data: As they say in computer science, \u201cGarbage in, garbage out.\u201d And, unfortunately, much of the health- and safety-related data currently available to train AI systems is low quality, Stevens notes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typically incomplete,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt may contain quite significant bias. It may not be robust, accessible, stored, secure, adequately protected, de-identified, private. No matter how sophisticated these AI technologies and tools get, if we\u2019re providing and training these tools with poor-quality health- and safety-related data or work data, it\u2019s ludicrous to think we\u2019re going to get a good outcome.\u201d\n\nCybersecurity and privacy: \u201cMany AI tools that are widely available for free use also open up security concerns for organizations with proprietary or personally identifying information,\u201d Dony says. \u201cPurchasing secure, internal-only versions is \u2013 at present \u2013 the purview of larger organizations and/or those who are on the early adoption side of technology.\u201d\n\nPossible bias and inequity: Because generative AI draws on existing data sets, it reflects the biases and stereotypes of the humans who created that content, raising the risk of inequitable outcomes. \u201cAn AI system can be designed in one environment for one group of people, and that could work out to be very successful,\u201d Vietas notes. \u201cIf, then, you decide to try and put that into a new environment with entirely different demographics of workers, you shouldn\u2019t expect to get the same outcome.\u201d\n\nWorker pushback: Discomfort with AI in the workplace can be traced to a number of causes:\n\nLack of familiarity with the technology and how it works\n\nFear among workers that they\u2019ll be replaced with AI tech or pushed into less meaningful roles\n\nAnxiety about learning to use the new tools and keep up as the technology changes\n\nConcerns about violations of privacy, \u201cBig Brother\u201d-style monitoring and how their data will be used\n\nTransparency and worker engagement can soften resistance, Stevens says.\n\n\u201cAn organization needs to simply articulate what AI means in their business: what applications (in simple terms) these solutions are being used for, how those tools have been trained, how workers are expected to interact with them and how their jobs are expected to change because of it,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd workers need to have a say in designing the strategy for implementation and adoption of those tools.\u201d\n\nNSC and AI Find more information from the National Safety Council on artificial intelligence, technology and the future of work.\n\nAre humans still required? (Yes)\n\nUltimately, the real dangers of integrating AI into workplace health and safety lie not with the technologies but with the humans who (mis)use them, especially if they fail to recognize that AI still requires substantial human direction, training and supervision.\n\n\u201cOverreliance on any tool or system \u2013 no matter how strong \u2013 is dangerous, and the same is true with AI,\u201d Dony says. \u201cOrganizations and people will need to find a place of mutual balance and comfort in which AI tools are viewed as reliable and effective \u2013 but not infallible \u2013 guidance, and are used to strategically and tactically act more quickly and thoroughly than before.\n\n\u201cOnce this equilibrium is reached, the potential for AI to have a real and lasting effect on safety is massive \u2013 a true enabler to a future in which no one loses their life on the job.\u201d",

        "text": "Anyone remotely wired into technology newsfeeds \u2013 or any newsfeeds for that matter \u2013 will know that AI (artificial intelligence) is the topic of the moment. In the past 18 months alone, we\u2019ve borne witness to the world\u2019s first AI Safety Summit, a bizarre and highly public leadership drama at one of the world\u2019s top AI companies, and countless prophecies of doom. And yet, even after all that, it seems businesses have largely failed to take meaningful action on AI.\n\nIn early May 2024, ISACA, a leading IT governance association, released new research revealing the extent of the AI problem. The crux of the issue is that most businesses use AI, and are worried about AI, but too few are actually doing anything about it. Let\u2019s look at some of the key findings from ISACA\u2019s report so we can better understand what they call \u201cThe AI Reality.\u201d\n\nAI Risks\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the most concerning findings. According to a poll of 3270 digital trust professionals, 70% of organizations use AI, 60% use generative AI, only 15% have AI policies, and 40% don\u2019t offer any AI training.\n\nIgnorant or untrained staff present a huge risk for businesses using AI. Uninformed AI use can result in serious ethical, financial, reputational, or even legal consequences, especially in the workplace. For example, a staff member unthinkingly using AI could inadvertently:\n\nExpose sensitive company information\n\nReflect existing biases or prejudices in their work\n\nBreach intellectual property laws\n\nAnd much more.\n\nIt\u2019s astonishing that nearly 18 months after the launch of ChatGPT and the entrance of generative AI tools into the public consciousness, many businesses are either unaware or actively ignoring the enormous risks associated with AI in the workplace.\n\nStranger still, while 60% of respondents reported being worried or very worried that bad actors will exploit AI, with 81% saying the top risk is disinformation/misinformation, only 35% said that AI risks are an immediate priority for their organization. It\u2019s unclear what exactly we can attribute these discrepancies to, but one may speculate that while digital trust professionals understand AI risks, decision-makers in their organizations don\u2019t.\n\nSimilarly, during a period of economic difficulty, many organizations may be overzealous in pursuing AI's productivity and financial benefits while being reluctant to spend money on addressing AI risks; this is obviously an unwise approach but perhaps an understandable one.\n\nAI Uses\n\nBut let\u2019s step away from the doom and gloom and look a little closer at how AI benefits the modern workplace. Somewhat predictably, ISACA\u2019s findings reveal that AI is used for:\n\nIncreasing productivity (35%)\n\nAutomating repetitive tasks (33%)\n\nCreating written content (33%)\n\nOf course, these are all extremely valuable uses for modern staff. In today\u2019s ultra-competitive, ultra-saturated market, any advantage an organization can gain is essential for business success and continuity, and AI can grant those advantages.\n\nAI\u2019s ability to automate repetitive tasks is a particularly interesting use case. Task automation has always been an almost ubiquitous business goal and one that has changed the world countless times over. The printing press allowed for the mass production of literature and was a critical factor in the birth of Protestantism; in the 18th and 19th centuries, automated machines replaced manual labor and brought about the Industrial Revolution; today, automation processes in smart factories have facilitated production on a scale never before seen.\n\nHowever, task automation has a dark side: job losses.\n\nAI and the Job Market\n\nISACA\u2019s respondents were reasonably confident that AI will change the job market, with 45% saying that many jobs will be eliminated over the next five years and 80% saying that many jobs will be modified; this is a sensible assumption, especially when compared to the impact of technological advancements throughout history:\n\nThe printing press eventually put scribes out of work.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution rendered countless skilled roles obsolete.\n\nSmart factories drastically changed the skills needed to work in the manufacturing sector.\n\nConsidering these examples, why should AI be any different?\n\nFortunately, however, digital trust professionals are cautiously optimistic about their place in the AI age: 78% said AI will have a neutral or positive impact on their careers. More encouraging still, 85% of those professionals accept that they must increase their AI skills and knowledge within two years. The future is clearly bright for the digital trust sector.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s clear that digital trust professionals are confident they can handle AI's introduction in the workplace, but the wider business world seems woefully underprepared. As advancements in AI come thick and fast and more organizations implement the technology into their business processes, more decision-makers must wake up to the need for improved AI training and policies; it may cost now, but failing to address AI risks will cost a lot more in the future.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The opinions expressed in this guest author article are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect those of Tripwire.",

        "text": "Malaysia and the rest of the Asia Pacific region are looking to capitalise on the current wave of AI-driven workplaces. Many workers today believe growing their tech skills would help them get to a better position in their careers.\n\nResearch from Amazon Web Services (AWS) revealed Malaysian workers with AI skills and expertise are more likely to experience an increase in their pay of up to 40%. In particular, those with skills in IT (52%) and research and development (49%) see the biggest bump in their salaries.\n\nThis potential for better pay and other positive impacts to careers is driving workers to invest in sharpening their existing AI skills or learning new ones.\n\nBoosting careers through AI skills development\n\nOf the more than 1,600 workers and 500 employers interviewed in the AWS survey, 97% of workers believe their existing AI skills can accelerate their careers by providing them with better job efficiency, job satisfaction and career progression.\n\nMeanwhile, 91% of respondents said they are interested in developing their AI skills further to help boost their careers.\n\nOptimism over the potential benefits of AI on careers is not exclusive to a single generation of workers, with Gen Z workers (92%), Millennials (92%), and Gen X workers (90%) embracing the trend.\n\nEven Baby Boomers (94%), who are typically on the precipice of retirement, have expressed interest in learning AI if they were offered courses.\n\nImproving productivity through AI upskilling\n\nThe AWS study also revealed how Malaysian organisations can benefit from developing their workers\u2019 AI skills.\n\nMany believe their companies can achieve a 57% improvement in productivity by incorporating AI tech into their workflow and outcomes (76%), a trend that encourages workers to learn new AI skills (66%) and boosts communication among teams (65%).\n\nEmbracing the AI revolution in workplaces\n\nMalaysia is hoping to lead the charge in workplace AI adoption in Asia Pacific: 97% of business leaders expect their organisations to incorporate AI into their processes by 2028.\n\nWhile employers seem to agree that AI adoption will have a profound impact on their companies, they seem to differ on which department would benefit the most.\n\nIT department (96%)\n\nBusiness operations (95%)\n\nResearch and development (94%)\n\nSales and marketing (94%)\n\nFinance (93%)\n\nHuman resources (89%)\n\nLegal (88%)\n\nMalaysia business leaders appear to have fallen head-over-heels for generative AI since it allows users to combine different ideas and produce new content such as conversations, stories, images, videos, and music.\n\nEmployers (98%) and workers (96%) interviewed in the AWS survey believe more gen AI tools will be deployed in workplaces over the next five years.\n\nAs many as 76% of employers expect gen AI to help boost their organisation\u2019s levels of innovation and creativity, 67% said the tech will support learning, and 65% said it will improve outcomes.\n\nBridging the AI skills gap\n\nWith more Malaysian companies putting emphasis on AI adoption, workers have yet to catch up on the demand for AI skills.\n\nAs many as 89% of companies are prioritising AI skills during talent recruitment. However, 81% of these organisations have yet to find workers with the right skill set companies need.\n\nThere also appears to be a significant gap in AI training awareness as 88% of business leaders admitted they don\u2019t have any experience running an AI-driven training programme for their employees.\n\nMeanwhile, 83% of workers interviewed said they are not yet familiar with career paths where AI skills are used.\n\nTo help address these issues, the AWS study recommends governments, private companies, and schools work together to formulate AI training programmes to equip workers with the right skills.\n\nSpreading the benefits of AI workplaces across APAC\n\nMalaysia is not the only country undergoing an AI revolution. Other markets in APAC are also starting to adopt the technology en masse. The AWS study predicts the region will experience significant changes over the next five years.\n\nHere are some of the key highlights from the AWS\u2019s Accelerating AI Skills: Preparing the Asia-Pacific Workforce for Jobs of the Future report:\n\nAPAC employers are willing to pay 44% more for IT, 41% more for R&D, 39% for sales & marketing, 39% for business operations, 37% for finance, 33% for legal, and 33% for HR workers if they have the appropriate AI skills for their roles.\n\nAPAC employers expect AI to boost productivity by 51% as the technology automates repetitive tasks (64%), improves workflow and outcomes (60%), and improves communication (59%). Meanwhile, workers believe AI can improve productivity by 50%.\n\nAs many as 92% of APAC employers believe AI will spread across workplaces in the region by 2028.\n\nOf these, 91% said IT departments will be the ones to benefit the most. Meanwhile, 89% said business operations, 88% said finance, 88% said R&D, 87% said sales & marketing, 82% said legal, and 81% said HR will experience the biggest advantages.\n\nGen AI will be the most common piece of AI tech to be adopted in APAC workplaces, with 93% of employers and 90% of workers believing this will happen within the next five years.\n\nAs many as 79% of APAC business leaders are prioritising AI skills and expertise in recruiting talent. However, 75% of these employers still cannot find the right AI talent that they need.\n\nMeanwhile, 79% of employers do not know how to conduct AI training for their workers.\n\nAs many as 71% of APAC workers do not know what AI skills they need to have, while 74% are not familiar with what training programs are available. An additional 74% said they are not sure about the relevant career paths where AI skills would be useful.\n\nGet ready to kickstart your AI transformation journey at TechHR Singapore on 18 July at Marina Bay Sands.

        "text": "Emerging areas such as sustainability and artificial intelligence are rapidly reshaping job scopes. ST ILLUSTRATION: MANNY FRANCISCO\n\naskST Jobs: What trends will shake up workplaces in 2025?\n\nIn this series, manpower reporter Tay Hong Yi offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career. Get more tips by signing up to The Straits Times\u2019 Headstart newsletter.\n\nQ: What key work trends will 2025 bring and how can I make the most of them?\n\nA: There are several job trends that are impacting the way talent is being upskilled, as well as the way organisations hire and relook job roles, said Ms Nicki Doble, principal adviser for corporate transformation at professional services firm KPMG here.\n\nEmerging areas such as sustainability and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly reshaping job scopes, she noted.\n\n\u201cThese areas, which were once considered niche , are now being seen as core competencies that employees will need to possess.\n\n\u201cIn the next few years, baseline competency in these areas will become minimally expected of employees and impact even workers who are not part of related industries,\u201d said Ms Doble.\n\nMs Iris Lew, senior engagement manager at strategic human resources consultancy DecodeHR, said: \u201cRoles that are repetitive or routine in nature are at higher risk and will likely be displaced by AI eventually.\u201d\n\nThese may include counter service staff, data entry assistants, telemarketers, assembly line workers, legal assistants, bookkeepers and junior programmers.\n\n\u201cIf you are in a field facing possible changes, consider building new skills and exploring opportunities in expanding sectors, such as healthcare, technology and green energy, to stay competitive,\u201d Ms Lew said.\n\nWhile skill demands are evolving and deepening, workers can take comfort in the increasing traction for hiring based on demonstrable skills, rather than merely on paper credentials.\n\nMs Doble said: \u201cThis democratises job roles, enabling a greater pool of talent to be tapped .\n\n\u201cFor employees, this shift underscores how transferable skills have become as important as core competencies when it comes to their perceived adaptability and the value they\u2019re able to bring to their roles.\u201d\n\nAnother trend is the rise of new working models, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cEmployers will need to cultivate an environment where teams can seamlessly collaborate and thrive, both in person and remotely,\u201d Ms Doble said.\n\nFor workers to thrive as these trends take root, she suggests that they embrace lifelong learning with a focus on both technical and transferable skills, via SkillsFuture schemes, online courses and workshops.\n\nWorkers should also seek to gain multidisciplinary exposure across various functions in their organisation.\n\n\u201cBy broadening knowledge and skill sets beyond core expertise, workers can better understand how different areas of the organisation intersect,\u201d Ms Doble said.\n\nThis understanding could help workers better identify opportunities for innovation or solutions that directly address what employers need, especially in an increasingly interconnected work environment, she added.\n\nThe technology, healthcare and maritime sectors are poised for particularly significant transformation in the coming years, said Ms Doble.\n\n\u201cThe technology sector will see increased demand for AI specialists focused on training, deployment of AI systems, and ethical considerations,\u201d she added.\n\nHealthcare, driven by the ageing population, will require more professionals in nursing, geriatric care and health technology integration.\n\n\u201cThe maritime sector is also being reshaped by automation and digitalisation, demanding expertise in smart logistics and autonomous systems,\u201d said Ms Doble.\n\nTwo other trends to watch out for are a boom in skilled trades and an increasingly multi-generational workforce.\n\nOn skilled trades, Ms Lew said: \u201cIndustries like manufacturing and construction need workers with specialised technical skills.\n\n\u201cApprenticeships, technical certifications and vocational training can help workers gain hands-on experience and the qualifications needed for these roles.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cnew-collar\u201d jobs, which typically require a combination of technical skills without the need for a specialised degree, are also on the rise.\n\n\u201cWorkers should look into gaining knowledge in areas such as cyber security, data analysis and robotics, as these fields are seeing rapid growth,\u201d Ms Lew said.\n\nShe also advises workers to maintain mutual respect, open communication and a willingness to adapt to different working styles when interacting with colleagues across generations.\n\nTo thrive in 2025, one must do more than just shore up one\u2019s technical skills.\n\n\u201cSoft skills such as communication, project management and critical thinking are also vital,\u201d said Ms Lew.\n\n\u201cWhile automation may handle routine tasks, workers will still be needed for decision-making, troubleshooting and problem solving.\u201d\n\nThey can put these soft skills into action through networking and career coaching sessions, which Ms Lew said would help workers build connections and learn how to transition into roles where existing skills are transferable.\n\nHave a

According to a new international study by Microsoft and LinkedIn, a staggering 75% of workers are now using AI tools in their jobs. This rise in AI adoption is rapidly reshaping the labour market, prompting businesses to reassess traditional hiring criteria. As AI becomes more ingrained in the workplace, it raises an important question: is experience still the most valuable asset, or is proficiency in AI the new benchmark for career success?The 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report highlights a fundamental shift in how companies are approaching recruitment. The study, based on responses from 31,000 individuals across 31 countries, reveals that AI expertise is now often preferred over years of experience. This emerging trend could be signalling the beginning of a new age of AI professionals, where having the right AI skills may outweigh the depth of one's previous job experience.AI's presence in the workplace is expanding rapidly. According to the report, three out of four workers (75%) are now using AI tools as part of their day-to-day tasks. This number has seen a remarkable jump, with nearly half (46%) of these employees starting to use AI within the last six months alone. Many workers report that AI has helped them manage the increasing volume and complexity of their workloads, with 68% admitting that they struggle to keep up with the pace of work. AI tools, such as generative models like ChatGPT, are especially useful for offloading routine tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more complex aspects of their roles.The adoption of AI is not restricted to large enterprises. In fact, 78% of employees bring their own AI tools to the workplace, particularly in smaller businesses. However, while AI is viewed as a productivity booster, many workers express concerns about its impact on job security. More than half (53%) fear that their reliance on AI could make them appear dispensable, and 45% worry that AI could eventually replace their roles altogether.The growing importance of AI skills is fundamentally changing how businesses hire. The Microsoft and LinkedIn report indicates that 66% of business leaders would not hire someone without AI capabilities, while a significant 71% prefer to hire candidates who are proficient in AI, even if they have less experience. This marks a clear shift away from the traditional focus on experience and towards a greater emphasis on digital fluency, particularly in AI applications.In recent years, the demand for AI roles has skyrocketed. Over the past eight years, the hiring rate for technical AI positions has increased by a staggering 323%. However, the latest trends suggest that companies are not just seeking AI experts but are increasingly looking for non-technical employees who can use AI tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot to boost efficiency. This trend underscores the value of AI literacy across a range of industries, extending beyond traditional tech-focused positions.The demand for AI-qualified professionals is not limited to the tech industry. PwC\u2019s 2024 AI Jobs Barometer found that roles requiring AI expertise are growing 3.5 times faster than all other job categories combined. Furthermore, AI specialist positions command a significant wage premium, with salaries in AI-focused roles being up to 25% higher than those in non-AI jobs. This wage boost is not limited to tech roles; professionals in fields such as law, sales, marketing, and accounting are also seeing the benefits of possessing AI skills.As AI becomes an essential part of modern work, the demand for highly skilled workers who can leverage these technologies is on the rise. More than three-quarters of workers in the survey acknowledge that AI knowledge is now crucial for remaining competitive in the job market. A significant 69% believe that AI expertise can accelerate career progression, while 79% see it as a way to open up new job opportunities.This shift is evident in the growing interest in AI-related education. In the past few months, there has been a 160% increase in the number of non-technical professionals engaging in LinkedIn Learning courses on AI, demonstrating that workers are eager to enhance their skills and stay ahead in a rapidly evolving job market.",

        "text": "As we enter 2025, career aspirations are part of common new-year goals. Whether one is looking for a job switch or preparing for their own venture, understanding the latest hiring trends is essential to stay competitive for both sought-after talent and recruiters seeking the best fit.\n\nA recent report from Naukri.com identified industries fueling job market expansion in December 2024. As per the report, AI and machine learning (ML) topped the charts with a 36% growth, followed by oil and gas with over 13% growth, FMCG with over 12% growth, and healthcare with over 12% growth.\n\nPawan Goyal, chief business officer at Naukri, said, \u201cIndia\u2019s job market is entering 2025 with vigour, driven by AI/ML growth and creative sectors. The surge in fresher hiring and evolving C-suite roles signals a transformation into a more dynamic landscape.\u201d\n\nSkills Critical for Hiring\n\nAI skills are emerging as a key requirement in this evolving job market. A LinkedIn report revealed that employees skilled in generative AI are five times more likely to develop complementary skills like creative ideation, design thinking, and emotional intelligence.\n\nOrganisations with more GenAI-skilled employees also see four times the usual rate of leadership promotions and five times the usual rate of overall promotions.\n\nIn an interview with AIM, Joseph Sudheer Thumma, CEO and MD of IT company Magellanic Cloud, stressed the growing importance of AI expertise. \u201cIn today\u2019s era, AI-related skills are essential across roles. At Magellanic Cloud, we prioritise candidates with a proven ability to learn quickly and adapt to change. While technical AI knowledge is crucial for some roles, we value curiosity and a growth mindset, ensuring continuous upskilling to meet tech-driven challenges.\u201d\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Rajesh Chandran Sogasu, senior VP at IT firm Happiest Minds Technologies, added, \u201cAI skills are vital for our Generative AI Business Unit and Analytics/AI Center of Excellence. For other roles, we offer training to help employees leverage AI for career growth.\u201d\n\nIn 2025, professionals with expertise in AI/ML technologies such as Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn will be highly sought after, along with the knowledge of neural networks and natural language processing (NLP).\n\nData engineering and big data skills, including experience in data pipelines, Hadoop, Spark, and cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud are also in demand. Organisations are actively seeking data science and analytics capabilities, such as advanced statistical analysis, SQL proficiency, and familiarity with visualisation tools like Tableau and Power BI.\n\nThe growing focus on AI ethics underscores the importance of understanding AI governance, bias detection, and data privacy laws. Additionally, roles in computer vision require expertise in OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), deep learning for vision tasks, and 3D modelling tools. At the same time, AI product management demands strategic thinking, project management skills, and a strong grasp of AI technologies.\n\nAppraisal Migration Wave\n\nThe IT sector\u2019s annual migration season kicks off in April. According to placement data from the job portal Apna.co, 82% of professionals are planning to change jobs, creating a ripple of anxiety among HR departments.\n\nSpeaking to AIM, Khushbu Singh, lead process excellence at Capgemini, explained an unusual shift this year, \u201cTypically, most companies follow the April-June appraisal cycle. However, delays in appraisals from the October-November-December (OND) cycle are now spilling into February. If OND cycles extend, it\u2019s likely the April-June cycle will push into September. Additionally, companies consolidating two appraisal cycles into one are adding to this uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nAs AI continues to reshape industries like IT, retail, automotive, and healthcare, Bengaluru stands out as the hub for AI jobs in India.\n\nV Suresh, CEO of foundit, told AIM, \u201cAI-driven solutions are creating demand for roles like machine learning engineers, AI researchers, and automation specialists. Key skills include NLP, computer vision, and AI ethics. Opportunities are concentrated in senior roles, with Bengaluru standing out as India\u2019s AI job capital.\u201d\n\nBeyond Bengaluru, other cities are also making strides. Chennai saw a 35% growth, while Hyderabad posted a 15% growth, driven by demand in IT, consumer durables, and real estate. Coimbatore stood out, with fresher hiring growing by 14%, fueled by a remarkable 52% surge in foreign MNC hiring.\n\nSo, upskilling is no longer optional. Updating resumes, staying informed about industry shifts, and being ready to relocate, if necessary, will be imperative this year.",

As your company prepares to hire or retain employees in 2025, here are the big hiring trends to watch for.\n\nThe use of AI is becoming more prevalent\n\nArtificial intelligence is helping recruiters streamline the hiring process, taking on tasks from resume screening to scheduling to even conducting entire interviews. In fact, in a survey from ResumeBuilder.com, more than half of respondents believe AI will eventually replace human hiring managers.\n\nDespite the growth of AI in HR, many businesses are still navigating the best way to use this technology. Gartner\u2019s research found that 55% of HR leaders report their current technologies don\u2019t meet evolving business needs. Rather than implementing an AI tool that delivers a short-term gain, leaders in 2025 will be looking for technology that simplifies and streamlines the hiring process while boosting long-term results.\n\n\n\nA strong EVP should highlight the reasons to join an employer and stick around, but it should not just be a list of selling points.\n\nJacob Zabkowicz, Vice President & General Manager of Global RPO at Korn Ferry\n\nSkills-based hiring will redefine recruitment\n\nSkills assessments emerged as a way to improve diversity hiring, speed up the hiring process, and manage high-volume hiring events. Since then, skill-based hiring has only become more prevalent. \u201cResearch shows that 90% of organizations using a skills-based hiring method report reducing their mis-hires, and 94% agree that skills-based hiring is more predictive of on-the-job success than resumes,\u201d wrote ADP.\n\nYet, hiring teams surveyed by Korn Ferry report that finding candidates with the right skills remains one of their top two challenges. \u201c[Many] are unsure of how to define critical skills, which is often the first step in the shift away from traditional hiring methods,\u201d reported the consulting firm.\n\nSkills-based hiring requires a different approach than traditional recruitment processes have used in the past. And, in 2025, we will see more recruiters shifting their approach to define the critical skills needed for each role\u2014both personal and professional skills\u2014and integrating different types of assessments and interview styles to get a clearer picture of those skills.\n\nEmployer branding is evolving\n\nEmployer branding emerged as a key trend for recruiters in 2023, when businesses started to recognize the power of employer branding not just for hiring, but also for selling. Data shows that your employee experience directly impacts your customer experience.\n\nHowever, employer branding in 2025 will require more than creating a few video testimonials for social media. Today\u2019s job candidates\u2014and customers\u2014are savvy about assessing a company\u2019s culture. They\u2019re looking for meaningful, authentic employee value propositions.\n\nAn employee value proposition (EVP) encapsulates the values, rewards, recognition, support, and company culture an employer gives employees, enabling them to do their best work and achieve their highest potential. Companies that live up to their promised EVP see higher retention, better productivity, and better performance.\n\n\u201cA strong EVP should highlight the reasons to join an employer and stick around, but it should not just be a list of selling points,\u201d Jacob Zabkowicz, Vice President & General Manager, RPO, Global at Korn Ferry. \u201cIf you are recruiting for retention, then the EVP needs to align directly to the organizational vision, mission, purpose and values\u2014to attract new employees with the right cultural and motivational fit.\u201d\n\nCO\u2014 aims to bring you inspiration from leading respected experts.

This helps HR spend more time on onboarding and training for new employees.\n\nAI decreases the time that HR professionals spend scanning through resumes and applications. This helps HR spend more time on onboarding and training for new employees. Hiring success rate. With AI tools such as automated chat assistants or resume screenings, you can move multiple candidates quickly through the hiring process by searching for specific data among your candidate pool and updating them on their status automatically. This technique improves hiring success by building trust and transparency with candidates. When a recruiter is open and transparent, a candidate feels respected during the recruitment process and comes away with a favorable lasting impression.\n\nPopular AI-Powered Recruiting Tools\n\nTwo types of frequently used AI recruiting tools are resume parsers and chatbots.\n\nResume parsers scan resumes and cover letters for words or phrases that match job descriptions, allowing information to be sorted.\n\nChatbots are software applications or web interfaces that automate workflows and are designed to mimic human conversation through text or voice interactions. Different from a chatbot people use on a clothing site or chat with customer service on Apple or a streaming service, Jasper, Mya, and Google Gemini are examples of chatbots that can be used to mimic human behavior during the recruitment process, to filter out information prior to reaching a physical recruiter.\n\nEthical Considerations When Using AI For Recruitment\n\nAI can be a helpful tool in recruiting, but there are ethical considerations to be aware of, including bias, accuracy, and privacy.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to be careful with AI because the information it examines can be biased. Make sure the data you input for it to use does not discriminate against any protected groups.\n\nIt can also lack accuracy or just not be able to interpret something the same way humans do, so it\u2019s necessary to cross-reference the facts that it outputs and correctly analyze resumes or cover letters.\n\nBe sure to scrape personal information including street addresses and phone numbers from applications so that information is not used again in the AI tool.\n\nExamples of Successful AI Implementation in Recruitment\n\nCase studies of successful AI recruitment demonstrate how different organizations are leveraging this new technology to enhance efficiency, improve the candidate experience, and make data-driven, unbiased hiring decisions.\n\nBritish consumer goods company Unilever uses HireVue\u2019s virtual interviewing tool to score candidates' spoken words and compare them to traits demonstrated by Unilever\u2019s high-performing employees.\n\nMakeup brand L\u2019Or\u00e9al has developed an AI-enabled interview tool from Step Stone\u2019s \u201cMya\u201d chatbot. Mya engages candidates by asking specific questions taken from an analysis of current successful L\u2019Or\u00e9al employees. The system can evaluate responses, sentence structure, and vocabulary from candidates. The process delivers an efficient and insightful candidate evaluation for HR recruiters.\n\nBest Practices for Integrating AI Tools into Your Existing Recruitment Workflow\n\nIntegrating AI into the recruitment process can be tricky, so it\u2019s important to have a strategic plan or approach.\n\nTraining on AI for an HR team is vital and will keep everyone on the same page and make for a smooth transition into recruiting with AI tools.\n\nIt\u2019s also crucial to find the right tools. Start by assessing where your gaps or opportunities to streamline may be and look for solutions that target your specific needs. SHRM offers a comprehensive playbook on AI that you can download to find additional research and resources to master technology that can further your HR career.\n\nFor additional guidance, SHRM provides an enterprise solutions site that works on implementing business solutions tailored to your organization\u2019s unique needs. Act now to revolutionize recruitment processes and find the candidates that best suit your business.\n\nIs AI Replacing Human Recruiters?\n\nTo address the elephant in the room: AI is not going to replace human recruiters. It will make their jobs easier and allow recruiters to focus on other tasks like planning orientation for employees and minimizing biases that might influence decision-making.\n\nTo stay ahead in the ever-changing field of recruitment, it\u2019s key to understand and take notice of the power of AI.",

        "text": "The world of work is changing at a staggering pace. From changes in talent acquisition practices to the rise in people analytics to the can\u2019t-be-talked-about-enough impact of AI, 2025 is sure to be a year of new opportunities and new challenges driven by the need for the workforce to be increasingly flexible and skilled to meet market demands. With that in mind, SHRM experts shared their insights on seven major trends that are likely to impact HR in the year ahead.\n\n1. Skills Over Degrees\n\nMomentum is surging around skills-based hiring, which is the idea that workers\u2019 skills and capabilities matter more than their educational background or work history. Focusing on what employees can do\u2014not where or how they learned to do it\u2014widens the talent pool, helps solve skills shortages, and boosts retention, says Justin Ladner, senior labor economist at SHRM.\n\nThe practice is catching on quickly: In 2024, 81% of employers practiced skills-based hiring, up from 73% in 2023 and just 56% in 2022, according to research from TestGorilla, a talent assessment platform.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing labor shortage provides a strong incentive for firms to search for ways to expand their ability to recruit and retain workers,\u201d Ladner says.\n\nRelated: Skills-Based Hiring Is Gaining Ground\n\nDisruptive events such as the pandemic and the subsequent labor shortages, as well as the rise of AI, have taught employers that an adaptable workforce is one of the most critical ingredients in future-proofing an organization.\n\nTherefore, says SHRM CHRO Jim Link, SHRM-SCP, companies are seeking employees who are persuasive, open to learning, and able to communicate well.\n\n\u201cWe used to think about [business] sustainability in terms of things,\u201d Link says. \u201cGoing forward, we\u2019re going to think that way about people. Do we have the right people with the right skills and enough workforce numbers for today and tomorrow?\u201d\n\nDo we have the right people with the right skills and enough workforce numbers for today and tomorrow?\u2014Jim Link, SHRM-CP, SHRM CHRO\n\nSome employers will also continue to rethink college degree requirements for certain roles. An analysis by Indeed found the number of job postings requiring at least a four-year degree fell to 17.8% in January 2024, compared with 20.4% in 2019. Of employers who eliminated degree requirements for some roles, 73% said they had successfully hired one or more candidates who previously would not have qualified, SHRM\u2019s 2024 Talent Trends research reveals.",

        "text": "The world isn\u2019t slowing down, so businesses must design hiring strategies to withstand seismic shifts. In the first quarter alone, there was no shortage of significant world news impacting hiring:\n\nThe European Parliament adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), the first of more regulations coming in the year. Workday acquired HiredScore as the trend toward market consolidation continues. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the U.S. economy added 303,000 jobs in March, a clear acceleration in hiring.\n\nSo, what should companies do to navigate this in a consolidating market with high demand for skilled workers? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Regulations & Actions\n\nFrom January to March candidates completed nearly 20 million assessments on HireVue\u2019s platform. This included Virtual Job Tryouts, game-based assessments, coding challenges, and video interviews. Since many of our assessments are built upon sophisticated algorithms, let\u2019s dive into recent AI news and what it means for you.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more nuanced conversations every day as world leaders lean into the expertise of practitioners and researchers, and the result is substantive work toward AI safety and regulation. In March, the European Parliament adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), and just a few weeks later the US and the UK signed a bilateral agreement to work together on testing advanced AI. The regulatory environment is going to get more complicated before it gets better, and according to our Global Trends Report, businesses are taking note: 34% have an internal team assessing the compliance of current products and 21% have sent requests to vendors for compliance documentation. But a significant number of leaders haven\u2019t done anything to shore up compliance.\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nThere are significant efficiencies to gain from smart implementation of these new technologies, but choosing rigorously tested products that are ahead of compliance trends is more important than moving quickly.\n\nAt a time when new products with lofty AI-based claims are being rolled out daily, it\u2019s more important than ever to select partners that prioritize transparency and ethics. This is especially critical with hiring where there are longstanding, clear, and enforceable standards for fairness like the 4/5ths rule that needs to be upheld alongside these rapidly evolving state, local, and federal AI laws.\n\nHiring technology isn\u2019t something to bootstrap, leaders need partners with robust internal compliance teams that contribute to groups like the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium. A vendor that doesn\u2019t have readily available 3rd party audit results and an AI Explainability Statement is not suited to handle one of the most consequential aspects of your business.\n\nAssessments that uncover a candidate\u2019s potential and conversational chatbots to engage candidates are essential in today\u2019s competitive hiring environment\u2014and they both have to be built on a rock-solid foundation of ethics compliance.\n\nThe Stabilizing Power of HR Technology\n\nAlthough the US has stayed out of recession, and many economic indicators are positive, it\u2019s undeniable that the general feelings towards the economy aren\u2019t stellar. And if you\u2019re a talent professional it\u2019s easy to see why. These teams have been hit particularly hard, especially in industries such as technology and media. Still, even with topline budget reductions, 30% of talent leaders report increases in their HR tech budgets.\n\nSo now let\u2019s connect that to market consolidation. Budget increases and consolidation show that companies want to get more done with one vendor and they see technology as a stabilizing force against constant change.\n\nIn the first three months of the year, our more than 1100 customers conducted millions of interviews and sent tens of millions of chat and text messages during their candidate interactions. There were volume increases across many industries, including retail (+14%), hospitality, recreation, and leisure (+39%), government (+146%), and communications (+244%).\n\nCompanies have a volume problem that isn\u2019t going anywhere. They don\u2019t want to use one vendor for chat, one for video interviews, and one for assessments. They want best-in-class products designed to flex for different hiring use cases and prefer most of it to be in one place with a solid ATS integration.\n\nWhy it Matters\n\nA seamless integration with your applicant tracking system (ATS) has always been important, but it\u2019s more important than ever with more originating from a single vendor. Practically, this means choosing to work with vendors that have certified integration partnerships with the multiple major players in the space.\n\nIt\u2019s looking less likely that the Fed is going to cut interest rates this summer, and budgets aren\u2019t likely to increase. Get your leadership to see HR not just as a cost center but as a strategic talent incubator and make a clear case for return on investment from the hiring tech stack.\n\nIn our globalized economy where large language models have become de rigueur, legacy HR systems that rely on resume screening and profile scraping stick out like a sore thumb. It is long past the point where leaders can pretend there\u2019s a difference between customer and candidate experience\u2013bad hiring technology can sow doubt about the rest of the business.\n\nJeremy Friedman is CEO of hiring platform HireVue.",

        "text": "IT Jobs in 2025: The IT services industry is projecting a 20\u201325% increase in the number of new hires, highlighting the need for expertise in cloud computing, data engineering, and software development.\n\nImage by Unsplash\n\nAI is here to stay, and it has started being inextricably linked to day-to-day activities. With a higher proportion of the workforce expected to reach retirement age in 2025 than in any previous year on record, firms will lose their most experienced staff quicker than ever.\n\nChallenges in on-the-job training amid AI integration\n\nThis is starting to leave managers wondering how they can educate future experts when the duties previously utilized to train beginner personnel are now undertaken by AI. A lack of hands-on training is a source of concern among both senior and junior staff, aggravating the expertise drain, the Harvard Business Review reports. According to a Gartner poll comprising 3,375 employees, conducted in May 2024, six out of ten believe they are not receiving the on-the-job coaching they need to support their key job competencies. Major IT companies are thereby intending to incorporate AI across their operations, and they expect staff at all levels to learn AI-related skills.\n\nTo confront this critical threat, organizations will need to strengthen their collective intelligence by leveraging technology to ensure that knowledge flows readily between experts with skills and rookie employees who lack abilities.\n\nAI as a driving force for recruitment in IT companies\n\nWipro, an established IT software company, plans to hire up to 12,000 new employees in the next fiscal year (FY26). The corporation planned to hire approximately 10,000 new employees this fiscal year (FY25). According to IANS, the company's Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil said that approximately 7,000 new employees were hired in the October-December (Q3) quarter, with another 2,500-3,000 projected to join in the fourth quarter of FY25.\n\nSimilar to Wipro, several other organizations are trying to hire new employees and train them in cutting-edge technologies. These corporations' 'AI-first' strategy is also driving an increase in campus recruitment. According to Sachin Alug, CEO of NLB Services, the majority of campus recruiting in the forthcoming quarter will be for qualified experts in Cloud Computing, Data Engineering, and Software Development.\n\nCompany executives want workers to use AI to boost output, cut down on busy work, and free up time and energy for more strategic and creative work.\n\nKey questions\n\nAI tools can also act as a competency filter in the workplace, allowing underperforming employees to make their meagre efforts seem extremely significant and productive to their supervisors and coworkers.\n\nThis brings up a number of queries, such as:\n\nShould companies make a distinction between real high performers and mediocre performers supported by AI?\n\nHow can companies retain top performers and maintain efficient internal talent pipelines and succession plans if they don't distinguish between augmented and independent performance?\n\nHiring trends in tech and rising salaries\n\nTeamLease Digital, a digital staffing and solutions provider, shared \"With respect to hiring in the tech sector, there have been distinct patterns for freshers, mid-level professionals, and senior management. Global Capability Centers (GCCs) have emerged as significant employers of fresh talent, offering entry-level candidates salaries that are up to 30 per cent higher than the industry standard for in-demand skills. This surge is expected to continue, with GCCs projected to increase fresher hiring by 40 per cent compared to the previous year.\"\n\nAccording to the Foundit insights tracker (fit), recruiting activity in the nation increased by 31% year over year in December, according to news agency PTI. The Fit is a thorough monthly analysis that examines online job posting activities. According to their research, hiring is surging across all industries, with consumer electronics, manufacturing, construction, and engineering leading the way.\n\nMeanwhile, over the previous two years, the number of AI jobs in India increased by 42% to 2,53,000 roles. Python, AI/ML, data science, deep learning, SQL, and software development are among the most sought-after competencies. Additionally, according to the survey, employers highly valued proficiency with specialized AI frameworks such as TensorFlow (15%) and PyTorch (16%).",

        "text": "With the NICs increase further stretching employment budgets and the Employment Rights Bill set to radically change the compliance landscape for HR and talent acquisition teams, there will no doubt be a lot of transformation and complexity to navigate.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a lot of promise in the world of talent acquisition and a wealth of opportunities to drive change for good. Here are some of the top areas that HR practitioners and talent leaders can capitalise on in the New Year.\n\nThe rise of AI\n\nArtificial Intelligence is perhaps one of the most hotly debated topics in the HR community at the moment. From difficulties sourcing AI skills given the infancy of this remit itself, through to exploring how these tools can support the HR and talent functions, there\u2019s a lot to discuss on the topic. What I would say, though, is that AI is both the problem and the solution, particularly in relation to skills shortages.\n\nGiven how new some of these tools are, there is an understandably limited supply of experts in this area to tap into. However, AI has huge potential to streamline engagement and attraction with potential new recruits. It\u2019s important to stress at this point that I\u2019m not talking about automation in relation to HR systems \u2013 that\u2019s an entirely different topic and opportunity in itself. However, AI is vastly intuitive and can achieve things many humans can\u2019t in such short timescales. That includes monitoring and assessing behaviours of talent pools both internally and externally to better map out where there\u2019s the potential to attract, or even lose, high performers.\n\nAny discussion around artificial intelligence does need to also address the issue of candidates using these tools in their job searches, which is a contentious issue in today\u2019s environment. While we may have seen a number of brands banning the using of AI in the job hunt (and in some cases, in work itself), there is a strong argument for allowing it.\n\nWhen we consider that this is an emerging technology, with a handful of \u2018experts\u2019 available to hire in this remit, having individuals that demonstrate an ability to use AI sufficiently and appropriately is, in fact, a promising sign in the hiring process. Yes, there will need to be clear boundaries and transparency around its use, but it\u2019s a sign of strength, not necessarily a weakness.\n\nPerhaps the greatest benefit that can be achieved by allowing greater AI usage, though, is the positive impact it can have on diversity. There are some under-represented groups that struggle with the writing element of the job process for absolutely no fault of their own, but are dismissed as a result, even though this particular attribute isn\u2019t always necessary for a role. If individuals are allowed to use AI to support their CV or cover letter creation, it can aid social mobility and diverse recruitment.\n\nSkills-first will become more critical\n\nOf course, much of the above requires a shift towards skills-first hiring in order to be successful. Where HR and talent teams are looking to improve diversity and attract individuals that show potential over technical attributes, existing rigid hiring structures become less relevant.\n\nThis shift towards skills-first hiring has been gaining momentum for much of this year, but with the demands of the workforce evolving at pace, there is a growing recognition across the business communities that how the attract talent needs to change. And they are looking to the HR function for guidance.\n\nThis is a prime opportunity to capitalise on the new world of work and reshape hiring practices to drive inclusivity, equity and diversity. Arguably, the changes to employment legislation also provide the chance and motivation for a rethink, but there does need to be authentic buy-in to talent acquisition reforms companywide to make them really work.\n\nTalent intelligence and labour market analytics will be business critical\n\nWith the growth of HR technology, comes a new platform to better integrate data and talent intelligence into strategies. Many leading employers have long implemented tracking and people metrics into their talent management systems, however, there\u2019s a core area of improvement that we have flagged in recent months; namely the reliance on incomplete or incorrect external data.\n\nThere has been growing concern around the accuracy of labour market data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the States. The reality is that the sample sizes for this information \u2013 which has historically driven corporate decisions around hiring and business growth \u2013 have shrunk. That means they aren\u2019t always a true reflection of the current market, which is further evidenced by the regular updates or reviews to previous data that we\u2019re seeing.\n\nHowever, there are more reliable sources of this information. As talent intelligence and labour market data becomes a more critical factor for business decisions, now really is the time to reassess what data is being collated and used to inform company strategies.\n\nSustainability needed, in more ways than one\n\nSustainability is going to remain a key theme for next year, but not just in relation to climate change and environmental awareness. There is a growing segment of the workforce that are placing an increased importance on their employer\u2019s impact on the environment, and this has already led to many companies adapting their EVPs to demonstrate that they are an environmentally ethical business.\n\nHowever, sustainability in relation to the workforce, and indeed, talent pools themselves, is another factor that will be of critical importance in the coming 12 months. The rate at which shortages are expanding means that employers are increasingly struggling to source the talent they need, hence the growth of skills first-hiring and use of AI-driven solutions mentioned earlier.\n\nIf organisations are to truly address this issue for longer-term growth, though, they need to be proactively creating skills as well, whether that\u2019s through internal mobility and training programmes, better engagement with education leavers or other, similar tactics. Again, the start of the New Year is a prime time to tackle this challenge for the benefit of longer-term talent acquisition. It has been a quieter period for some hiring strategies, but this will pick up. Those that get ahead of the game now and are able to create a sustainable pool of talent, will be the brands that are in the best possible position come the end of next year.\n\nOver the course of the next 12 months, we\u2019re going to continue to see a lot of change for HR and talent acquisition teams, but we should never lose sight of the opportunities that this also creates. There\u2019s a wealth of potential to reshape talent acquisition, for those brave enough to lead the charge.",

        "text": "Evolving hiring trends in 2025 emphasise automation, hybrid work flexibility, skills-based hiring, employee well-being, and the rise of the gig economy\n\nImage by freepik\n\nThe beginning of the year is dedicated to supercharging career aspirations. Many candidates look for a job switch while recruiters sift through new trends and design their hiring strategy for the year. This makes new hiring trends even more critical for employer organisations to remain competitive in the market. In 2024, new-age technologies - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) took over the hiring space. However, the year 2025 focuses on their implementation in the changing workplace expectations, attracting and retaining the most suitable candidates for the organisation.\n\nAs this transformation is highly driven by technology, it equally influences the priorities of recruiters and employer organisations. As per a recent industry report by AIM (Analytics India Magazine), AI and Machine Learning (ML) lead job market expansion with 36 per cent growth, followed by 13 per cent growth in oil and gas, and 12 per cent in FMCG and healthcare industries. A similar growth trajectory will bring innovation in Human Resources (HR) technology and introduce new hiring trends in 2025.\n\nThe rise of automation\n\nIt is vital yet time-consuming to find the most suitable candidates in a fiercely competitive market. Traditionally, recruiters relied on manual intervention in managing hiring-related tasks. However, the adoption of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in automating the recruitment processes eliminates the job of handling mundane tasks for talent managers. Additionally, workflow automation helps them streamline their screening process, schedule interviews and create, review and deliver offer letters seamlessly.\n\nHybrid work as the norm\n\nThe onset of the pandemic brought a paradigm shift in the world of work, introducing hybrid models across industries. In 2025, flexibility in work will shift from a perk to a necessity. Organisations are reimagining their hiring practices to accommodate remote and on-site work preferences. As a result, recruiters are promoting digital infrastructure, robust communication tools and hybrid work policies to attract suitable candidates. As part of the new trends, recruiters are emphasising offering flexibility, work-life balance and an engaging culture, rethinking the employment value proposition.\n\nSkills-based hiring takes centre stage\n\nThe timeworn approach focused on job titles and roles is transitioning to a more practical skills-based hiring approach. Traditional criteria such as degrees and years of work experience are no longer considered the primary criteria for hiring. Recruiters are increasingly giving more preference to candidates with practical abilities and competencies rather than formal qualifications. This trend will democratise access to opportunities and enable candidates from diverse educational backgrounds to thrive in 2025.\n\nFocus on employee well-being and retention\n\nWith talent shortages looming across sectors, recruiters have understood the pivotal need for employee retention. Organisations are adopting a holistic approach to ensure employee well-being with wellness programmes, mental health support, and financial planning resources. In 2025, these initiatives will become integral to the workplace culture, focusing on building an inclusive environment where employees feel valued and heard, significantly enhancing their retention.\n\nSurge in the gig economy\n\nAs skill-based jobs are surging, the gig economy will experience unprecedented growth in 2025 to offer both opportunities and challenges for employers and workers. The increased use of gig platforms will provide freelancers and contract workers more autonomy and flexibility. On the other hand, organisations will engage gig workers with specialised skills without long-term commitments. This will lead talent managers to design robust work models for careful management, productivity and alignment with organisational goals.\n\nThe emerging hiring trends in 2025 reflect the convergence of technological progress, societal shifts and evolving employee expectations. Recruiters should upskill via HR Tech-focused academic certifications to stay aware of these trends and create a forward-thinking culture in which organisations can not only attract top talent but also build a resilient workforce capable of thriving in an ever-changing environment. The year 2025 is a year of revolution in HR technology that requires both recruiters and candidates to adapt to new trends for planning long-term careers.\n\nThe author is the Co-founder, Instahyre.",

        "text": "Imagine for a moment the bustling corridors of a company\u2019s HR department, where the air is thick with the hum of phones, the clatter of keyboards, and the soft murmur of recruiters huddled over stacks of CVs. It\u2019s a scene of organized chaos, where every day brings a new wave of hopeful candidates and pressing deadlines. This is the world before AI stepped in, where finding the right talent felt like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n\nNow, picture a transformation. With the flick of a switch, AI breathes new life into this space. Gone are the repetitive, time-consuming tasks. Screening CVs, scheduling interviews, and sending follow-ups \u2013 once a recruiter\u2019s daily grind \u2013 are now managed effortlessly by intelligent algorithms. These digital assistants sift through vast amounts of data to identify the best matches, personalizing communication, providing instant feedback, and shortening hiring timelines.\n\nYet, the true magic of AI lies not just in its efficiency, but in its ability to foster diversity and inclusion. Imagine candidate profiles stripped of identifying information, focusing solely on skills and qualifications rather than demographics. This anonymized approach allows every applicant to be seen for their true potential, leveling the playing field and promoting a more equitable hiring process.\n\nDrawing on insights from Natalia Perkowska, Deputy Chief HR Officer at SOFTSWISS this article explores how the international technology product company has adopted AI to modernise hiring practices, making them more inclusive and efficient.\n\nTwo Sides of the AI Coin\n\nThe transformation in the HR department is indeed astounding. Yet, as with any powerful tool, there are two sides to the AI coin.\n\nOn one side, AI revolutionizes recruitment. It makes the process faster, more cost-effective, and incredibly precise. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI identifies the best-fit candidates with an accuracy that no human could match. This reduces time-to-hire and allows recruiters to focus on strategic initiatives and relationship-building. The data-driven approach ensures that candidates are evaluated on their skills and qualifications, promoting a fairer and more inclusive hiring process.\n\nHowever, on the other side, AI\u2019s reliance on data is both its strength and its Achilles\u2019 heel. The quality of AI\u2019s decisions is only as good as the data it is fed. Poor-quality or biased data can lead to flawed outcomes, potentially perpetuating the very biases AI aims to eliminate. Ethical concerns also come into play. For AI to be truly effective, it must be transparent and fair, but ensuring this level of accountability is a complex and ongoing challenge. Algorithms must be continuously monitored and refined to prevent unintended consequences.\n\nIn the end, at the heart of this technological marvel, the human element remains a critical consideration. The future of AI in HR is not about replacing humans but augmenting their capabilities, allowing for a more efficient, fair, and inclusive recruitment process that values every candidate\u2019s true potential.\n\nInnovating HR with AI: Insights from SOFTSWISS\n\nAt SOFTSWISS, a bustling team of recruiters once felt the strain of an ever-growing stack of resumes. Then, with a stroke of innovation, AI entered the scene, seamlessly taking over high-volume tasks. The initial transformation was remarkable\u2014automated systems screened hundreds of CVs, pinpointing the most suitable candidates swiftly and accurately. AI\u2019s precision in matching skills with job requirements was unparalleled.\n\nHowever, SOFTSWISS didn\u2019t stop there. Recognizing the irreplaceable value of human judgment, they struck a perfect balance. While AI handles the repetitive tasks, human recruiters remain pivotal in decision-making. Cultural fit and soft skills, essential for team harmony, are assessed by seasoned professionals. This hybrid approach ensures that recruitment isn\u2019t just about data but about people.\n\nTransparency is another cornerstone of SOFTSWISS\u2019s strategy. Candidates are informed upfront about the role of AI in the hiring process, fostering trust and clarity. Feedback loops, such as candidate surveys, are actively used to refine and enhance the system continuously, ensuring it meets both business and applicant needs.\n\nBy prioritizing balance, SOFTSWISS ensures that technology supports \u2013 but never replaces \u2013 the human essence in recruitment. This thoughtful integration of AI and human insight creates a recruitment process that is efficient, fair, and deeply human-centered.\n\nAI and the New Dynamics of HR Professionals\n\nPicture an HR professional, who used to spend their days buried in stacks of resumes, arranging interviews, and managing endless paperwork. The daily grind was filled with routine tasks, leaving little time for strategic thinking.\n\nThen, a powerful tool called AI entered the scene. This technology took over mundane tasks, allowing HR professionals to focus on more significant responsibilities. With AI handling the routine, they could delve into long-term workforce planning, analyze market trends, and align recruitment strategies with their company\u2019s goals. AI provided data-driven insights, enhancing decision-making with precision.\n\nHowever, this transformation required developing new skills. They had to master interpreting complex data and ensure the ethical use of AI. Their emotional intelligence and creativity were essential in maintaining the human touch when hiring.\n\nAI didn\u2019t replace HR roles but augmented them. Automated tasks freed HR teams to concentrate on strategic initiatives. This made their job more fulfilling and improved the recruitment process\u2019s efficiency and fairness. This journey highlights how AI transforms human resources \u2013 not by replacing humans but by enhancing their roles, making recruitment smarter, fairer, and more human-centric.\n\nPredicting Tomorrow: AI\u2019s Role in Shaping Inclusive Hiring Practices\n\nAs we look towards the horizon of HR innovation, it\u2019s clear that AI will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping inclusive hiring practices. The future of HR is set to be shaped by three key trends, as envisioned by Natalia Perkowska, Deputy Chief HR Officer at SOFTSWISS.\n\nFirst, AI will be instrumental in fostering diversity and inclusion by mitigating unconscious bias, ensuring equitable hiring practices that align with societal values and business imperatives. Second, candidates will demand personalized experiences, including tailored communication, job recommendations, and onboarding processes, all delivered seamlessly by AI at scale. Lastly, the integration of AI with predictive analytics will allow companies to forecast talent needs, plan workforce strategies effectively, and make proactive hiring decisions.\n\nThe rise of AI in recruitment is inevitable and brings challenges. But by shaping how technology and human insight work together, we can create a recruitment process that is smarter, fairer, and deeply human. AI supports, not replaces, the human touch. Embracing AI\u2019s potential while staying true to the heart of recruitment will create faster, fairer, and more personal hiring processes. The future of hiring is smarter, more inclusive, and ultimately more human.",

        "text": "How Are AI-Powered Recruitment Trends Shaping the Hiring Practices in India\n\nRecruitment landscapes in India are undergoing a seismic shift. AI-powered tools have taken over and are redefining traditional hiring practices. Indian companies are actively looking for more agility and precision in talent acquisition. The recent market demand presents a unique opportunity \u2013 leveraging artificial intelligence to tap into the talented workforce of the region.\n\nAddressing Critical Challenges in Recruitment\n\nThe recruitment drive in India is gaining significant traction. Despite the demand, the hiring practices are lagging significantly behind. The average time to fill a vacancy falls short by several miles. A large part of this problem stems from outdated, cumbersome, and time-consuming acquisition procedures.\n\nThe key concerns of the industry are:\n\nOutdated recruitment processes slow down hiring and fail to keep up with demand.\n\nThe time to fill vacancies is significantly longer than needed, affecting workforce planning.\n\nCumbersome acquisition procedures create inefficiencies and hinder timely recruitment.\n\nAI\u2019s Transformative Impact\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence presents a promising one-stop solution to these challenges in the Indian market. By adopting AI technologies, companies are effectively addressing and overcoming these obstacles.\n\nTools like applicant tracking systems (ATS), predictive analytics, and automated interview platforms are cutting down the overall time to recruit a candidate by a significant margin.\n\nHere is what a strategic implementation of AI-driven recruitment models can do for Indian companies:\n\nReduced Time-to-Hire: With AI, the time taken to fill a vacancy can be streamlined effectively. Strenuous screening processes like resume shortlisting and aptitude tests can be automated, requiring little to no human intervention. From the results, recruiters can filter in the best candidates to appear in further, more personal rounds.\n\nImproved Diversity Hiring: AI-powered recruitment presents another significant advantage\u2014the removal of unconscious bias. Unidentifiable data like names and photos can be removed from the candidate pool; in such situations, AI will filter in the most promising candidates, overcoming inherent discrimination. This fosters inclusive hiring practices, a strategic imperative for a country as diverse as India.\n\nData-Driven Decisions: AI leverages the use of predictive analytics. With such tools governing recruiting strategies, firms can evaluate candidate success probabilities based on past performance and behavioral data. This results in a more objective recruitment session and ensures long-term success for the company as well as the selected employee.\n\nChallenges in Adoption of AI\n\nAI integration isn't without its hurdles; there are substantial challenges that must be navigated to achieve successful implementation.\n\nThe key areas of concern are:\n\nMaintaining algorithm transparency with the talent pool and candidates.\n\nEnsuring strict data privacy of sensitive candidate-related information.\n\nMitigating potential errors in decision-making.\n\nBeyond these technical gaps, there is an element of skepticism surrounding AI\u2019s impersonal approach. Candidates may feel alienated and question the firm\u2019s decision, especially in earlier rounds where human involvement is minimal. A balanced approach is key to the integration of AI for recruitment.\n\nWinding Up\n\nAI in recruitment can be a game changer in India. With a growing, diverse pool of talent, challenges like time-to-hire, the manpower used up in the process, and ensuring long-term retention can be mitigated with associated technological tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.",

        "text": "A new report claims that some of the world\u2019s largest employers are planning to scale back hiring in 2025 as they focus on raising salaries and upskilling their existing workforce.\n\nThe Hiring Trends Report 2025, from Glasgow-based candidate screening platform Willo, surveyed more than 100 senior talent acquisition executives globally, including leaders from industries such as automotive, technology, and professional services. It revealed a significant shift in priorities around hiring this year \u2013 driven principally by shifting market conditions and the influence of technology, including AI.\n\nThe findings show a 48% decline in companies planning substantial workforce growth compared to 2024. Meanwhile, there has been a 33% increase in employers intending to boost salaries and a striking 78% rise in those prioritising upskilling existing staff.\n\nThe results of the survey arrives as the UK Government announces a sweeping action plan to increase 20-fold the amount of AI computing power under public control by 2030 and deploy AI for everything from spotting potholes to freeing up teachers to teach.\n\nThe survey showed the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in recruitment remains a focal point, though not without controversy. More than half (53%) of organisations plan to change their AI capabilities in 2025, with 10% saying they will replace their recruitment AI tools completely. However, scepticism is growing. The number of leaders who believe AI should play no role in hiring more than doubled in 2024, reaching 9%.\n\nDespite this, AI adoption continues to rise. Currently, 65% of organisations use AI in recruitment, although this falls short of the 80% predicted in last year\u2019s survey.\n\nOne notable finding is that nearly a fifth (18%) of hiring managers are using AI to help make final hiring decisions, a practice that has drawn criticism.\n\nEuan Cameron, co-founder and CEO of Willo, said: \u201cWhile AI offers incredible efficiencies at scale, its use in making final hiring decisions is surprising and concerning. The final stage of the hiring process is where human judgement is most valuable. I would question the wisdom in placing such significant business decisions in the hands of an algorithm. \u201d\n\nAI is proving effective in other areas, such as assessing candidate abilities. Nearly 40% of firms use it to evaluate skills, helping recruiters conduct fairer and more consistent assessments. By automating repetitive tasks, such as resume reviews, AI reduces bias and ensures each candidate receives a fair chance.\n\nRecommended reading\n\nAdditionally, 35% of respondents said they use AI to enhance internal efficiency, including tasks such as transcribing interviews and summarising key insights. These tools allow recruiters to dedicate more time to face-to-face interactions and gain a clearer picture of candidates.\n\nThe report also highlights a 59% rise in employers implementing flexibility programmes, reflecting the growing demand for hybrid working arrangements.\n\nCameron added: \u201cThe shift towards fewer hires, higher wages, and upskilling mirrors broader economic and technological trends. Employers who focus on retention through flexibility, diversity, and inclusion will not only strengthen their workforces but also enhance their appeal to new talent. The firms that take bold steps to attract and retain talent will be the ones to thrive in 2025.\u201d",

And employees, struggling under the pace and volume of work, are bringing their own AI to work. While leaders agree AI is a business imperative, many believe their organization lacks a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line. The pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders inert, even in the face of AI inevitability.\n\nWe\u2019ve come to the hard part of any tech disruption: moving past experimentation to business transformation. Just as we saw with the advent of the internet or the PC, business transformation comes with broad adoption. Organizations that apply AI to drive growth, manage costs, and deliver greater value to customers will pull ahead.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market is set to shift again\u2014with AI playing a major role. Despite fears of job loss, leaders report a talent shortage for key roles. And as more employees eye a career move, managers say AI aptitude could rival experience. For many employees, AI will raise the bar but break the career ceiling.\n\nTo help leaders and organizations overcome AI inertia, Microsoft and LinkedIn looked at how AI will reshape work and the labor market broadly, surveying 31,000 people across 31 countries, identifying labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, and analyzing trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals as well as research with Fortune 500 customers.

        "text": "1. IT\u2019s Strategic role and business integration\n\nThe world is waking up to the reality that IT is the engine driving business growth, innovation, and efficiency. IT doesn\u2019t sit in the back office, quietly troubleshooting. By 2025, it will be embedded at the heart of strategy, working shoulder-to-shoulder with marketing, HR, and finance teams. Data security, analytics, and process automation aren\u2019t confined to IT anymore either, they\u2019re shared responsibilities, shaping the decisions that move the needle for entire organizations.\n\nEtoulia Salas-Burnett from Howard University paints a vivid picture of this shift. Emerging positions like AI integration specialists and automation success managers are becoming must-have. These roles go beyond coding and maintenance, connecting technology with actionable business strategies. At the same time, traditional roles like help desk technicians and network administrators are fading, a natural outcome of automation and smarter systems.\n\nIT leaders are now clearly partners in crafting the tools and processes that keep businesses nimble and competitive. The core message is clear: the future belongs to organizations where IT is treated as a core part of strategy.\n\n2. Focus on retaining and upskilling talent\n\nHiring fresh faces is expensive and time-consuming. Retaining your existing team? That\u2019s where the \u201cmagic\u201d happens. Companies are prioritizing retention because every departure means lost institutional knowledge and higher costs. Upskilling your current workforce is both cheaper and smarter.\n\nBrittany Lutes from Info-Tech Research Group states that providing new levels and job titles keeps employees motivated. You need to show your teams a path forward. Greg Goodin from EXOS TALENT agrees, pointing out that an engaged, skilled workforce is a competitive advantage. Upskilling saves money compared to onboarding and training new hires while giving your team the tools they need to tackle tomorrow\u2019s challenges.\n\n3. Skills-based hiring is on the rise\n\nDegrees are great, but skills pay the bills. Companies are ditching traditional qualifications in favor of hiring people who can deliver specific, targeted competencies. It\u2019s a practical move, especially in high-demand fields like AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.\n\nJulia Stalnaya from Unbench points out that roles like ethical hackers and data scientists are in high demand because they meet the precise needs of a tech-driven world. Skills-based hiring can be transformative. Blockchain developers, for instance, are shaping decentralized systems that could redefine industries, to take a single example.\n\nThe shift to skills-first recruitment reflects the fast pace of technological advancement. Businesses aren\u2019t only looking for who you are on paper. They want to know what you can do. It\u2019s a bold new hiring paradigm that puts results front and center.\n\n4. Impact of layoffs and flexible hiring models\n\nThe 2024 tech layoffs shook the industry, but they also opened doors. With more talent available, companies are exploring lean staffing models, subcontracting, and other flexible solutions to find balance. The core focus here is staying agile in an unpredictable world.\n\nJulia Stalnaya notes that subcontracting is becoming a key strategy. It gives companies access to top-tier talent without the long-term commitments of traditional hiring. Greg Goodin highlights the shift to ROI-driven recruitment. Businesses are done with \u201cemployee hoarding\u201d and are focusing on hiring people who directly contribute to their bottom line.\n\nThis new environment also requires that companies think creatively to attract talent. Flexibility and culture are just as important as salary, making it critical to adapt hiring strategies to what candidates value most.\n\n5. AI and automation will change and shift roles\n\nAutomation isn\u2019t coming for your jobs, it\u2019s creating better ones. AI handles repetitive tasks, freeing up people to focus on strategy and innovation. The result? A growing demand for specialized roles like AI specialists and automation success managers.\n\nJulia Stalnaya makes it clear that AI is driving productivity to new heights. Companies are doing more with less, and it\u2019s reshaping how organizations work. Etoulia Salas-Burnett adds that IT professionals now need to think like strategists, combining their technical expertise with big-picture business thinking.\n\n6. Access to global talent pool and remote work\n\nRemote work has broken through geographical barriers. Companies can now hire the best talent from anywhere on the planet, but this opportunity comes with challenges. Adapting to flexible work arrangements is key to keeping these global teams engaged.\n\nGreg Goodin points out the role of international hiring and H-1B visas in broadening talent options. Universities and bootcamps are also stepping up, aligning their curricula with what the market needs. Matt Collingwood underscores the importance of tackling unconscious bias in hiring by anonymizing CVs and using tools like gender decoders. The goal is to create diverse, inclusive teams that reflect the world we live in.\n\nTalent is everywhere, but companies need to be intentional about how they find and nurture it.\n\n7. Green IT and sustainability focus\n\nFrom phasing out legacy systems to adopting energy-efficient technologies, businesses are finding creative ways to reduce their environmental impact.\n\nMatt Collingwood points out that CIOs are facing more pressure to include green initiatives in their IT plans. Smaller AI models, biodegradable packaging, and energy tracking are just a few of the innovations driving this trend. This focus on sustainability is creating new opportunities in infrastructure and systems engineering.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAre you empowering your teams to evolve, or clinging to outdated models while your competitors adapt? The future demands bold moves. Integrate AI, invest in your people, and think globally.",

        "text": "A recent survey by talent discovery platform TestGorilla has revealed that a vast majority of employers are increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their hiring processes.\n\nThe 2024 global survey report gathered data from over 2,000 employers and employees across the UK, US, Australia, Europe, and Latin America, highlighting the changing landscape of recruitment in the era of AI.\n\nAccording to the survey, 81% of employers are utilising skills-based hiring practices in 2024, marking an increase from 73% in 2023 and 57% in 2022. The report emphasises a growing need for human-centric soft skills that AI cannot replicate, creating a new dynamic in recruitment. A multi-measure approach to skills-based hiring, which combines different skills-based tests and assignments to measure various job-relevant skills, is identified as the optimal method.\n\nThe report found that 40% of employers who implement skills-based hiring are using multi-measure testing. This approach has yielded significant results, with 92% of these employers reporting satisfaction with their hires. They also noted several other benefits: 91% experienced a reduction in mis-hires, 83% saw a decrease in costs to hire, and 94% reported improvements in both diversity and employee retention.\n\nTestGorilla CEO and co-founder Wouter Durville commented on the importance of soft skills in the AI-driven hiring landscape. \"It is evident that skills-based hiring is the best-suited recruitment method for businesses and employees embracing the future of technology through AI,\" he said. \"Our annual report continues to show a year-on-year increase as more employers are reporting the benefits as they move away from traditional recruitment methods.\"\n\nSoft skills are becoming increasingly valued in the workplace, with 89% of employers indicating that they believe these skills are more important now than they were five years ago. Durville highlighted this trend, stating, \"For years, employers have known that the top employees possess a variety of soft skills. As new technologies emerge and hybrid working rates continue to rise, there is an increasing need to identify and develop soft skills.\"\n\nOne of the key findings of the report is that 84% of employers are taking steps to help their workforce embrace AI, and 52% are specifically hiring for AI-related skills. This shift underscores the importance of a balanced approach to hiring that equally values both technical and soft skills. Such a strategy is essential to securing employees who can thrive in an AI-augmented work environment.\n\nEmployers adopting a multi-measure approach are reportedly reaping significant benefits. In addition to improved satisfaction with hires, these businesses are experiencing substantial improvements in various metrics. The reduction in mis-hires (91%) and cost-to-hire (83%) indicates increased efficiency and effectiveness in the hiring process. Additionally, improvements in diversity (94%) and retention (94%) reflect the positive impact of comprehensive candidate assessments on the workforce.\n\nThe findings from TestGorilla's report suggest that the integration of AI in recruitment is not merely a trend but a shift towards a more refined and effective hiring strategy. Employers are recognising that while AI can streamline many aspects of the recruitment process, the human element, particularly soft skills, remains crucial to a successful workforce. As businesses continue to navigate the evolving landscape of work, strategies that combine AI with robust soft skills assessment are likely to become standard practice in recruitment.",

        "text": "CENTENNIAL, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amidst continuous discussion and debate surrounding artificial intelligence's transformative impact on our lives and work, it is already fundamentally reshaping the tech job market. In an analysis of tech job posting data, Dice (a DHI Group, Inc. brand; NYSE: DHX), found that 14% of all tech job postings in February 2024 referenced skills related to artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML). This is up 5 percentage points from the previous year, when just 9% of tech job postings referenced AI or ML-related skills.\n\nWhen looking at the total number of open AI / ML jobs, that increased 8.5% from the beginning of 2023 (56,018) to the beginning of 2024 (60,784). This surge in demand is further accentuated by the notable decline of 26% in overall tech job postings during the same period. These numbers exponentially speed up the learning curve for recruiters, talent acquisition leaders and organizations in understanding not just the basics of generative AI, but also the AI skills and roles their businesses need today and what they will need in the future.\n\n\u201c This is an exciting time to be in tech; in terms of AI\u2019s magnitude, it\u2019s on par with the dawn of the internet and the release of the first smartphones,\u201d says Dice CEO Art Zeile. \u201c Artificial intelligence is not a new phenomenon, but the demand for AI skills today is escalating across almost every sector.

The Technical Recruiter's Guide to Building an AI Team emphasizes the importance of a collaborative approach between talent acquisition leaders, technical recruiters and tech leadership in identifying and attracting top AI talent. The Tech Professional's Guide to Navigating AI Jobs and Careers analyzes the most in-demand skills for AI roles and how to upskill technical and soft skills to be competitive in this job market.\n\nThe AI Hiring and Job Posting Landscape\n\nWithin a span of less than two years, tech professionals skilled in generative AI have become highly sought after. Not surprisingly, \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d has seen strong growth in job descriptions year over year; when comparing February 2024 to February 2023, AI has increased by 36%.\n\nSalaries for AI and ML-related roles also show the impact generative AI has had in a short period of time, as these salaries have continued to grow during a time when the average tech salary has flattened. In its 2024 Tech Salary Report, Dice data showed the average salary for someone skilled in machine learning is $122,060 \u2014 almost 10% higher than the average tech salary of $111,193.\n\nThis trend is mirrored across various AI-related roles and skills, emphasizing the importance of that expertise in today's job market:\n\nData Science: $116,807 (5% higher than the average U.S. tech salary) Machine Learning: $122,060 (10% higher than the average U.S. tech salary) Software Engineer: $145,206 (31% higher than the average U.S. tech salary) Data Engineer: $120,248 (8% higher than the average U.S. tech salary) Solutions Architect: $157,768 (41% higher than the average U.S. tech salary)\n\nAlmost every industry sector \u2014 from retail to healthcare to manufacturing \u2014 is witnessing a surge in AI hiring. Companies like Deloitte, Accenture and KPMG are doubling down on AI projects, signaling a strategic shift towards prioritizing AI talent acquisition. \u201c Any time there's a major shift in a technology in the U.S., corporate America generally wants to experiment with consultants before they bring those people onto their own payroll,\u201d Zeile says. \u201c They want to pilot and experiment to see what it means for their business model.\u201d\n\nAnd even amidst the backdrop of recent layoffs by Amazon, Google and Microsoft, these industry giants are among the top 15 companies hiring for AI talent right now \u2014 underscoring a concerted effort to prioritize AI initiatives.\n\nTakeaways for Recruiters: Adapting Strategies to Win Top Talent\n\nWhile AI is not as new as it may seem, it is still a recent technology that is rapidly advancing. As demand continues to increase, companies that need to fill AI roles will find fewer tech professionals with extensive experience on their resume. Here are some tips for recruiters to take the next steps and act on their AI/ML hiring strategies:\n\nPrioritize skills-based hiring. Embracing a skills-based approach works especially well with tech roles because these professionals already have a culture that emphasizes skills over titles. By focusing on applicable skills over traditional metrics like education or experience, companies can expand their options and effectively recruit for top AI talent.\n\n\n\nUnderstand core AI and ML skills and applications. One of the biggest challenges with AI hiring is that, outside of the specialized tech professionals who can build AI and machine learning models, there is a lot of gray area when it comes to titles, roles and skills. Not every tech professional is going to have the same AI skills, but for most, an understanding of data wrangling and preprocessing, algorithms, software engineering, machine learning frameworks or cloud computing are a great start.\n\n\n\nWork with your tech leaders to recruit and upskill talent you already have. One way to build your AI team is by looking within your company first for the talented tech professionals who are willing to move and upskill in the AI space. Consider offering generative AI training programs to educate your entire workforce on the fundamentals of AI, and use this as the first step to identifying potential candidates who show an aptitude for AI concepts.\n\nTakeaways for Tech Professionals: Charting a Path in the AI Era\n\nNavigating career development in a dynamic field like artificial intelligence and machine learning can be daunting for tech professionals. However, AI builds upon existing skills and leverages familiar technologies, offering exciting opportunities for growth. Here are key insights for tech professionals ready to start on the AI upskilling journey:\n\nIdentify your familiarity with the core AI competencies and know your frameworks. As tech professionals use AI to handle low-level tasks, they can spend their time focused on mastering higher-level disciplines and competencies. Frameworks act as pre-assembled toolkits, offering tech professionals essential building blocks to streamline their AI development processes. There is a huge variety in the type of frameworks, but there are many transferrable skills between them.\n\n\n\nImprove your soft skills. Improving soft skills makes tech professionals more valuable to their current and future employers \u2014 those can never be replaced by AI. Innovation and creativity, communication, and providing insight to leadership are key soft skills to focus on.\n\n\n\nContinue AI education with courses and certifications. AI is evolving quickly, and today\u2019s landscape will quickly be a thing of the past as new language models, tools, and platforms are created. Online or in-person courses dedicated to foundational AI disciplines are great for tech professionals ready to upskill. Courses that offer a final test allow tech professionals to demonstrate their understanding and expertise to current and future employers.\n\nDice's Commitment to Empowering Recruiters and Tech Professionals\n\nAs the demand for AI-skilled tech talent continues to soar, Dice remains steadfast in its commitment to facilitating meaningful connections between employers and tech professionals.

        "text": "One year ago, generative AI burst onto the scene and for the first time since the smartphone, people began to change the way they interact with technology. People are bringing AI to work at an unexpected scale \u2014 and now the big question is, how\u2019s it going?\n\nAs AI becomes ubiquitous in the workplace, employees and businesses alike are under extreme pressure. The pace and intensity of work, which accelerated during the pandemic, has not eased, so employees are bringing their own AI to work. Leaders agree AI is a business imperative \u2014 and feel the pressure to show immediate ROI \u2014 but many lack a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market is set to shift and there\u2019s a new AI economy. While some professionals worry AI will replace their job, the data tells a more nuanced story \u2014 of a hidden talent shortage, more employees eyeing a career change, and a massive opportunity for those willing to skill up.\n\n\u201cAI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,\u201d said Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft. \u201cOur latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration \u2014 and ultimately business outcomes.\u201d\n\nFor our fourth annual Work Trend Index, out today, we partnered with LinkedIn for the first time on a joint report so we could provide a comprehensive view of how AI is not only reshaping work, but the labor market more broadly. We surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, identified labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, analyzed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals and conducted research with Fortune 500 customers. The data points to insights every leader and professional needs to know \u2014 and actions they can take \u2014 when it comes to AI\u2019s implications for work.\n\n1. Employees want AI at work \u2014 and won\u2019t wait for companies to catch up.\n\nThree in four knowledge workers (75%) now use AI at work. Employees, overwhelmed and under duress, say AI saves time, boosts creativity and allows them to focus on their most important work. While 79% of leaders agree AI adoption is critical to remain competitive, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI and 60% worry their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it. While leaders feel the pressure to turn individual productivity gains into organizational impact, employees aren\u2019t waiting to reap the benefits: 78% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work. The opportunity for every leader is to channel this momentum into ROI.\n\n2. For employees, AI raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling.\n\nWe also see AI beginning to impact the job market. While AI and job loss are top of mind for some, our data shows more people are eyeing a career change, there are jobs available, and employees with AI skills will get first pick. The majority of leaders (55%) say they\u2019re worried about having enough talent to fill open roles this year, with leaders in cybersecurity, engineering, and creative design feeling the pinch most.\n\nAnd professionals are looking. Forty-six percent across the globe are considering quitting in the year ahead \u2014 an all-time high since the Great Reshuffle of 2021 \u2014 a separate LinkedIn study found U.S. numbers to be even higher with 85% eyeing career moves. While two-thirds of leaders wouldn\u2019t hire someone without AI skills, only 39% of users have received AI training from their company. So, professionals are skilling up on their own. As of late last year, we\u2019ve seen a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude.\n\nIn a world where AI mentions in LinkedIn job posts drive a 17% bump in application growth, it\u2019s a two-way street: Organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract the best talent, and professionals who skill up will have the edge.\n\n3. The rise of the AI power user \u2014 and what they reveal about the future.\n\nIn the research, four types of AI users emerged on a spectrum \u2014 from skeptics who rarely use AI to power users who use it extensively. Compared to skeptics, AI power users have reoriented their workdays in fundamental ways, reimagining business processes and saving over 30 minutes per day. Over 90% of power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable, but they aren\u2019t doing it on their own.\n\nPower users work for a different kind of company. They are 61% more likely to have heard from their CEO on the importance of using generative AI at work, 53% more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function and 35% more likely to receive tailored AI training for their specific role or function.\n\n\u201cAI is redefining work and it\u2019s clear we need new playbooks,\u201d said Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn. \u201cIt\u2019s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.\u201d\n\nThe prompt box is the new blank page\n\nWe hear one consistent piece of feedback from our customers: talking to AI is harder than it seems. We\u2019ve all learned how to use a search engine, identifying the right few words to get the best results. AI requires more context \u2014 just like when you delegate work to a direct report or colleague. But for many, staring down that empty prompt box feels like facing a blank page: Where should I even start?\n\nToday, we\u2019re announcing Copilot for Microsoft 365 innovations to help our customers answer that question.\n\nYouTube Video Click here to load media\n\nIf you\u2019ve got the start of a prompt, Copilot will offer to auto-complete it to get to a better result, suggesting something more detailed to help ensure you get what you\u2019re looking for.

        "text": "In this guide to hiring trends for 2025, we\u2019ll explore the evolving landscape of recruitment.\n\nStarting from the use of artificial intelligence to determine the costs of hiring top talents and shifting to skills-based recruitment, it will be important to understand all these shifts to attract and retain top talents.\n\nIf you are concerned about the changes to come, you're in the right place. Keep reading this article.\n\nOverview Of Current Hiring Landscape\n\nWith the year 2025 approaching, the hiring process is shifting due to changes in the technologies we use, the needs of the people, and market forces.\n\nThe selection process has become more sophisticated, with employers emphasizing sourcing and selecting high performers in the marketplace. Remote working has increased the accessibility of talents, as recruiters can access a large database of talents.\n\nThe rise of AI in determining potential candidates for a certain position and skill-focused recruitment is evident. Now, hiring managers are rather more active and ensure the use of technology and big data to facilitate the process and minimize expenditures on hiring.\n\nAs economic players adjust to a 'new reality' on the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic, workplace flexibility and upskilling have emerged as critical. They constitute the emerging practices in the selection processes and will set the course of talent management in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAutomation and AI In Recruitment\n\nTechnology is being rapidly adopted in the talent acquisition process, specifically the use of AI and automation. Are these technologies becoming a mere fad of the future, or have they changed how recruiters seek and retain the best talents?\n\nRobotic processes can handle tasks such as sorting out job offers and related tasks or screening resumes, minimizing the time that human resource professionals spend on such tasks. Whether it\u2019s scheduling interviews or generating engaging job descriptions, AI\u2019s usefulness in recruiting seems to know no bounds.\n\nAI also works wonders for recruiters in terms of hiring by identifying the best-suited candidates. As such, to be on the right side and to attract and maintain talented employees in the future, these companies have no option but to embrace these new trends, including AI and automation.\n\nLooking to streamline your hiring process and manage property maintenance with ease?\n\nWith AllBetter, you can find, compare, and book trusted contractors in minutes. Whether you need cleaning, repairs, or other services, AllBetter connects you with top professionals quickly and efficiently. Take the hassle out of property management\u2014visit AllBetter and start saving time today!\n\nVirtual Hiring Processes\n\nMost employers will have virtual hiring means or procedures as the trends for talent acquisition. The change from a workplace to a remote one has made it mandatory for organizations to look for talent without regard to geographical location.\n\nFor those recruiters hiring through virtual or video interviewing platforms, there is an added advantage of a wider pool of talent, which allows the narrowing down of the options. This trend applies more when recruiting generational employees, especially the millennials who thrive on work flexibility and digital interface.\n\nOrganizations need to incorporate these recruiting trends in their strategy and operate within the digital environment. Future hiring will again depend on efficiency and accessibility, with the target being to get the best for the company in the least time in the coming years.\n\nData-Driven Decision Making\n\nWith organizations under increasing pressure to deliver better results, the methods of choosing talents are also changing, with more emphasis placed on data-driven systems. Today, employers will use analytics to determine how to recruit employees. Integration with HRIS software also plays a crucial role in this data-driven approach, providing organizations with comprehensive analytics and insights to inform their hiring strategies.\n\nAs indicated in a trends report, business leaders can acquire information on talent trends and be in a position to innovate, write job descriptions, and make decisions based on that information, as proposed by the World Economic Forum.\n\nEmployment is also susceptible to change, with approximately 85 million jobs estimated to experience change by 2025, meaning organizations have to deal with changes. Therefore, with a focus on data over intuition, employees will have to rise to the expected demands of the workforce, thus creating efficiency and hiring promising employees.\n\nChanging Workforce Demographics\n\nThe dynamics of the workforce will alter, and these are liable to factors such as genetic or demographic characteristics as well as expectations.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, over half of jobs are going to be transformed through advanced technologies or the movement of talents, which translates to approximately 85 million jobs.\n\nSince the baby boomers are now retiring, new talent with dissimilar characteristics and qualities is assuming these roles, thus making companies change how they recruit this talent. Such a push translates to a change in the job descriptions and, where possible, using trends reports to source the right talent.\n\nEmployers cannot afford to overlook the key fact that employees need to be more diverse and aligned with the requirements of the contemporary workforce.\n\nRise Of Remote And Hybrid Work\n\nWork-from-home and blended work designs are not merely ideas; they are gradually becoming the typical practice.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, employees must embrace flexibility in the workplace to stave off competition. This change has not been instigated by the COVID-19 pandemic alone but is a change in how companies function worldwide.\n\nBusinesses are now modifying the job description to reflect such models to attract the right talent. Incorporating time-tracking software has become essential in managing remote and hybrid teams effectively, ensuring accountability and productivity. Another recent trend identified in the LinkedIn report shows that organizations adopting this flexibility lead to higher productivity and increased satisfaction, hence showing a more permanent shift in the workplace.\n\nIncreasing Diversity And Inclusion Efforts\n\nA diverse and inclusive work culture will not just be a fashionable term\u2014instead, it'll be a vital strategy for organizations. It's also necessary to notice that business organizations have finally come to understand that a diverse population enhances creativity and efficiency in the decision-making process.\n\nThe World Economic Forum notes that employees will have to work in contexts that respect cultural/identity diversity. According to a LinkedIn trends report for 2021, a plurality of job postings are changing to ensure that no talent is ignored and that everyone is welcome. For example, the logistics industry is now hiring more women in trucking to promote gender diversity in a male-dominated industry, proving that inclusivity is essential for innovation. While the drive towards diversity isn't regulatory, it remains a business imperative that organizations must pay attention to, especially in the contemporary market.\n\nGenerational Shifts In Workforce Expectations\n\nChanges in generational trends and expectations are recasting the shape of the workforce. Millennials and Gen Z are currently the dominant generation within the labor force, and they value flexibility, quality of work, and balanced working time over contractual benefits, including job security.\n\nThese younger generations want to work for employers who are in harmony with the company's culture and values and, more importantly, the employees' needs for growth, diversification, and inclusiveness.\n\nBaby Boomers and Gen X want more stability and recognition of their expertise. With such diverse expectations across age groups, managing performance in a multigenerational workforce becomes a critical challenge that organizations must address to retain quality employees in this complex and dynamic world.\n\nSkills And Qualifications\n\nWhat used to be niche benefits are now mandatory \u2013 digital literacy and AI know-how. Choosing the right talent depends on the companies' needs, but they prize data analysis skills, specialist cybersecurity skills, and cloud expertise.\n\nTechnical skills are as necessary as 'people' skills, such as the ability to adapt to change, solve problems, and communicate effectively, all of which are essential to working effectively in a given landscape.\n\nConstant learning shall be crucial, as employers would prefer constant learners who strive to update themselves in a world that demands more professionalism due to the emergence of new sophisticated technologies.\n\nEmphasis On Soft Skills\n\nSoft skills will become even more required, and companies will not be able to compromise on the candidates' abilities in this field.\n\nWhen trillions of machines perform technical work, the endowment of humanistic skills like speech, understanding, communicating effectively, and collaboration becomes a priority. Many business organizations are keen on acquiring such skills to establish a good team that performs effectively in various circumstances.\n\nApplicants with good problem-solving, interpersonal, and flexibility skills will be advantageous. The shift is clear: employers today look for employees who perform well and are good corporate citizens who can enhance organizational culture and foster team cooperation and creativity.\n\nDemand For Tech-Savvy Candidates\n\nEmerging patterns that have been widely adopted are the focus on technical talent who possess specializations such as artificial intelligence, search engine optimization (SEO), data analysis, and cybersecurity.\n\nThe continued digitalization of companies makes it necessary to find people who can cope with multiple platforms and applications. Companies are not hiring mere coders but persons who should grasp technology in relation to business.\n\nTo counter this, candidates must embrace the changes and develop new skills that may be prerequisites to preventing firms from surpassing the odds in a digital age. This proves the focus on fluidity from conventional roles to those that are both technical and strategic, thus having tech-savviness becomes beneficial in employment.\n\nAs organizations adopt new technologies, effective onboarding experience becomes crucial for employee success. Tools like Flook are increasingly valuable, offering interactive tooltips, guided tours, and checklists to help new hires navigate complex software systems. This not only accelerates the learning curve but also ensures that tech-savvy candidates can quickly leverage their skills in new work environments.\n\nLifelong Learning And Upskilling\n\nContinuing education and learning new things are no longer nice additions\u2014they are the norm. Over time, employers require specific skills to be performed, thus pushing the need for more talent in a particular industry. Those who ensure they undertake training repeatedly shall remain relevant, thus creating opportunities.\n\nEmployers are looking for people with many endorsements because employees today must be able to update their skills to apply to their organizations. This change can be attributed to the worldwide general trends that require professional development to be promoted and pursued. Whether it's tech professionals or event photographers, staying up-to-date with industry standards has become essential.\n\nIn the current environment, it is not possible to remain fast asleep. Promoting knowledge enhancement is a fundamental aspect that connects one to future promotions and career stability.\n\nEmployer Branding And Candidate Experience\n\nAs the competition in the labor market increases, employers need help hiring the most desirable content writers. Poor employer branding, followed by a poor candidate experience, puts off candidates.\n\nPeople today do not only look for salary anymore; more importantly, they look at values and culture and want more transparency. This is because a bad experience during hiring may yield a bad reputation for your company, as well as having a limited talent pool from which to draw.\n\nEmployer branding should remain a priority when it comes to promoting activities such as the company's culture, values, and employee narratives. Improve the candidates' perception of your company by having an easy and fast application process, communicating with the applicants frequently, and giving them an overview of your recruitment process.\n\nAlthough this approach successfully attracts competent candidates for job openings, its success is also revealed in long-term staff retention.\n\nImportance Of Company Culture\n\nCompetition for the best employees is becoming stiffer and stiffer today. Organizations that must focus more on the relevance of culture tend to experience greater levels of employee attrition and low engagement. The incompatibility of culture erodes satisfaction and efficiency, and the company wastes time and money.\n\nThe right corporate culture can only achieve the employment of talented and competent people in an organization. It creates a positive workplace, brings the workers to the organization's side, and promotes cooperation.\n\nOverall, an organization with a clear and strong culture can easily attract the best talent in the market and motivate and retain employees over time.\n\nEnhancing the Candidate Journey\n\nThe candidate experience is changing, and optimizing it is the way to recruit the best talent. Applicants of the current generation expect a clear, non-complicated process from submitting their applications to join the organization's team. This process especially includes communication with candidates\u2014each candidate should hear that you are interested in their past work experience and their future prospects.\n\nThe application's designs have to be easier to use, especially when implementing the mobile-first interface. Inform the candidates in real time via SMS and keep them updated on the status of their applications.\n\nOne should consider investing in Artificial Intelligence technology to map jobs with the candidate and reduce the cycle time so as to enhance the quality of hire and the candidates' experience. Optimization of these contact points will, therefore, put your firm in a better standing in a competitive environment.\n\nRole Of Social Media In Recruitment\n\nConventional recruitment methods sometimes have to play catch-up as more and more candidates prefer to deal online rather than face-to-face. With 3.6 billion users on social media, talent acquisition is only possible with them. Overlook them, and you'll be missing the boat.\n\nRecruiters can locate passive candidates, get an idea of their personality and whether they would fit the company's culture through their social media profiles, and respond to potential employees in real time.\n\nLinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram insight not only reveal much about the character, aptitudes, and connections of the candidate, but organizations can also brand themselves as employers, effectively market their company culture, and find people who are compatible with it.\n\nEconomic Influences\n\nFluctuating economy, inflation, and economic instabilities in the global market have tested organizations' handling of hiring dynamics. Organizations require assistance in meeting the right balance between outsourcing to cut costs and attracting talented professionals to the workplace.\n\nThat is because, as budget constraints emerge, the stakes involved in every hire become equally tight. The consequences are high-risk\u2014mistakes may result in inefficient organizational actions, revenue loss, and a competitive inferiority complex.\n\nIt has become imperative for organizations to go into the market for talents for hiring with eyes wide open. Whoever is in charge of deciding those priorities, whether it is HR or some other department, must look at the roles that directly impact revenues, invest in skills training, and consider using staff augmentation to answer those economic pressures and become keen on growth.\n\nImpact Of Economic Fluctuations\n\nEconomic factors significantly shape hiring trends, with businesses increasingly seeking cost-effective solutions. In uncertain times, companies prioritize flexibility, favoring IT staff augmentation and remote work options to manage fluctuating demand. Staff augmentation allows businesses to scale operations without long-term commitments, offering agility in response to market changes.\n\nCustomer support integration is also crucial, as companies focus on maintaining customer satisfaction amid economic pressures. This trend emphasizes the need for skilled professionals who can drive financial services optimization and data driven decision making, ensuring business processes remain efficient and customer-centric during economic shifts.\n\nIndustry-Specific Hiring Trends\n\nIndustry-specific requirements are expected to play the most crucial role in determining the future of hiring. The required profiles will remain popular in technology companies as more industries adapt to digital change: data engineers and artificial intelligence specialists. The healthcare industry will witness higher demand for medical, paramedical, and nursing personnel because of population aging and emphasis on patients' treatment.\n\nAt the same time, due to enhanced regulatory requirements, the financial services industry will emphasize compliance and risk management positions. Every industry will have its problems, and specific approaches will need to be designed to keep key staff and remain relevant in the market.\n\nThe Gig Economy And Freelance Work\n\nThe concept of full-time employment has become changing, making employers and employees unsure of the outcomes.\n\nEmployers require assistance identifying the caliber of talent; workers desire work-life balance and career autonomy. While gigs, freelancers, and freelance work are being taken more frequently to address some problems, these are posing other problems in managing the workforce and its stability, not to mention the legal issues related to that type of work.\n\nTake advantage of this change by outsourcing those requirements to freelance websites and gig employees. This is flexible, can access a wider pool of talent, and is cost-efficient, ensuring your business is ready for the emerging employment structures.\n\nLegal And Regulatory Considerations\n\nThe concept of legal and regulatory analyses is part of anticipating the future of hiring. Staying ahead is essential given these changes to the labor laws and the growing instances where DEI issues are paramount in business.\n\nThis is why it is imperative to honor data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA in scenarios such as remote hiring. Furthermore, new laws exist today, especially regarding the use of artificial intelligence when recruiting employees, which direct that organizations be transparent and non-discriminatory in the selection process.\n\nStay updated on the law often, ensure DEI training, and integrate correct technology into the business. Remaining active in these areas protects your business and promotes proper employment practices.\n\nChanges In Labor Laws\n\nLabor laws are as dynamic as they come and have the potential to chart the future of hiring. Governments around the world are making policies for work flexibility, gig economy jobs, and workers more stringent. These changes seek to achieve two goals: flexibility and fairness in the system's usage, but at the same time, they present some difficulties for businesses.\n\nIt is critical to follow guidelines related to new wage laws, workers' protection, and teleworking guidelines. Companies must, therefore, ensure that their employment practices and contracts are up to date to avoid fines and create good workplace relations.\n\nSustaining such modifications will be critical in providing a basis for acquiring talented employees that would enable the organization to survive in such a saturated market.\n\nCompliance With Diversity Mandates\n\nIn the new world of human resources, diversity is not a mere fad but a fundamental mechanism of compliance. For this reason, over time, the employment of diversity measures will quickly become more functional than symbolic in an attempt to meet these new equity requirements.\n\nEmployers must adhere to the legal requirements of employment while hiring employees who are ethnically diverse in the market. Failure to observe these mandates would lead to legal ramifications, and the firms would have lost a chance to grow and diversify.\n\nRegulatory compliance is, therefore, not an option of the past; it is the only future-oriented solution to achieving ongoing success.\n\nRemote Work Regulations\n\nWith increasing trends in working from home, organizations also undergo various complex tasks of meeting changing laws within different parts of the world. These difficulties in compliance management aggravate while operating with international coworkers and expose severe legal and financial dangers.\n\nBusinesses still may face concerns such as taxation, labor laws, and working conditions without being fully aware of remote work policies. This puts growth on the balance and may lead to penalties that businesses will have to face.\n\nTo remain competitive, many organizations need to learn about the current and future rules and standards or local and global laws and adopt stronger compliance programs and tools to address the challenges of teleworkers.\n\nDid I Miss Anything?\n\nNow, I'd love to hear your thoughts!\n\nWhich aspects of the Hiring Trends for 2025 that we discussed today caught your attention?\n\nAre there specific trends or strategies that will immediately impact your recruitment or talent management practices? Or are there particular innovations in hiring technology that could reshape your approach to sourcing and retaining top talent?\n\nWhether you're focused on enhancing your recruitment process, integrating AI-driven tools, or adapting to the evolving workforce dynamics, I'd like your thoughts and experiences.

        "text": "India's rapid economic growth has put pressure on organisations to compete for skilled talent in the global market. Despite the promising economic landscape, a recent LinkedIn poll unveiled a surprising trend: 88 per cent of Indian professionals are contemplating a job change, with nearly 80 per cent seeking opportunities in different industries or roles.\n\nHowever, navigating this job market can be challenging, especially with the evolving technological landscape dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). Approximately half of job seekers feel they lack the necessary skills for their desired positions, highlighting a significant skills gap that needs to be addressed.\n\nAs AI continues to play a pivotal role in businesses, the demand for skilled AI developers and users is on the rise. Recognising this, forward-thinking companies are leveraging this challenge as an opportunity to invest in developing existing talent. This strategic approach not only benefits individual employees but also strengthens the organisation as a whole.\n\nTo bridge the skills gap, an increasing number of learning and development (L&D) professionals are collaborating closely with HR departments to design tailored training programs. Moreover, companies are expanding their talent pool by tapping into the highly skilled workforce in Tier-2 cities, a segment often overlooked in the past.\n\nBy relocating headquarters or establishing satellite offices, employers are capitalising on the untapped potential of these regions to meet their hiring needs. This shift reflects a growing recognition of the talent diversity across India and underscores the importance of adapting hiring practices to leverage emerging opportunities in the evolving job market, stated Shipra Kamra, Head of People Operations, Responsive, during a recent interaction with People Matters.\n\nExcerpts from the interview:\n\nHow do you approach upskilling and L&D as an HR-lead, what are some approaches best-fit for the talent in India?\n\nOur unwavering commitment to continuous learning and development remains a central focus as we navigate the ever-evolving technology landscape.\n\nResponsive has established a valuable partnership with LinkedIn Learning, offering an extensive array of courses spanning various skills. This collaboration empowers our employees to leverage these resources to their advantage.\n\nWe diligently identify skill gaps within our teams and take proactive steps to ensure our employees attain relevant training, consistently enhancing their expertise in their respective fields.\n\nMoreover, we actively promote employees exploring diverse roles within the organisation, providing opportunities for acquiring and developing new skills. We also prioritise employee participation in industry seminars, where experts and professionals from the same domain converge to facilitate knowledge exchange and the cross-pollination of ideas and best practices.\n\nThe growing interest in internal mobility among our employees is particularly thrilling, signalling a positive organisational culture. We encourage employees to pursue industry certifications and recognise their achievements. Certifications enhance skills and add value to employees' professional profiles.\n\nLately, SaaS companies are widening their presence beyond core IT markets and having their capabilities in tier-2 cities. Responsive\u2019s viewpoint on how best to work with talent in other cities and inviting lateral hires?\n\nWhile the majority of India\u2019s businesses still operate from Tier-1 cities, many are relocating or establishing offices in smaller Tier-2 cities such as Coimbatore, Responsive\u2019s primary hub.\n\nExpanding our workforce into Tier 2 cities has proven to be a resounding success for Responsive. Coimbatore teems with exceptional talent in terms of skills and a positive work attitude.\n\nThe key advantage of targeting cities like Coimbatore lies in the fact that we can tap into the potential of individuals who possess remarkable skills but are unable to or prefer not to relocate to Tier 1 cities, typically as a result of personal commitments or desire to stick to their roots.\n\nBy establishing our presence in these cities, we unlock the potential of these ambitious and committed talents, fostering a sense of loyalty that leads to the retention of invaluable domain knowledge.\n\nCoimbatore boasts numerous colleges that consistently produce highly skilled engineering professionals. These educational institutions have become reliable sources of emerging talent for us, creating a fresh pool of capable individuals year after year. Our partnerships with these educational establishments have been instrumental in helping us identify and secure the best local talent to support our ongoing growth and success.\n\nWe also integrate a hybrid hiring model that allows us to fulfil our skill requirements from Tier 1 cities while simultaneously establishing a robust foundation in Tier 2 cities.\n\nWhat are the hiring trends for 2024 like, and how do they differ between the global market and India?\n\nA survey of nearly 3,100 employers in 41 countries found that India\u2019s net employment outlook (those who plan to hire minus those who plan to reduce staff) is 37 per cent \u2014 tied with the Netherlands for first place.\n\nIndustries with the most significant needs include those in finance, real estate and IT, all of which are embracing new technologies. One trend, however, is universal. Every responding company reported a talent shortage, with an average of 75 per cent of companies worldwide reporting that roles are difficult to fill. 81 per cent of respondents in India report that it is difficult to hire qualified employees.\n\nAs organisations plan their strategic HR objectives for 2024, employee well-being, recruitment for skilled roles and adopting AI and technology seems to be the top 3 in the chart of priorities. Training the staff to leverage AI and narrowing down on roles that can take advantage of this advancement continues to remain a concern.\n\nYou can also read:\n\nWhat are expected to be the most significant hiring trends in 2024?\n\nToday\u2019s HR professionals understand that the needs of the company and those of employees are inseparable. Those who are most successful will embrace emerging technologies while helping create an environment that attracts and retains the best talent.\n\nAdoption of Artificial intelligence\n\nWith the increasing potency of technology, HR departments are poised to undergo a surge in AI integration. The adoption of systems operating on AI principles is expected to be widespread among companies, marking it as one of the foremost recruiting trends in 2024.\n\nEmployer Brand & Value Proposition:\n\nFostering a positive employer brand and a compelling value proposition plays a crucial role in shaping a favourable perception of the organisation, drawing in the right talent, and cultivating a workplace that enhances employee satisfaction and retention.\n\nThese components are essential for establishing a resilient and prosperous workforce. Companies are prioritising these factors as key strategies to distinguish themselves in a competitive landscape.\n\nTailoring the recruiting strategies for new generations\n\nMillennials currently constitute the largest segment of the workforce, and with the addition of Generation Z, the younger generations are poised to take the forefront in the workplace. Consequently, recruiting will need to adapt their strategies and campaigns to resonate with the values and priorities of these emerging generations. Generation Z, in particular, places significance on factors such as the organisation's mission, culture, commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as well as the social impact and contribution the organisation makes to the world. Navigating these evolving dynamics promises to be an intriguing challenge for recruitment efforts.\n\nIs there any advice you would like to share with HR professionals in India?\n\nHR professionals should ensure that HR strategies are in alignment with the overarching business objectives, utilise data for making informed HR decisions, and, above all, prioritise the organisation's culture. As the saying goes, \"Culture eats strategy for breakfast.\"",

        "text": "92% of Indian knowledge workers use AI in the workplace, finds Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index\n\n91% Indian leaders believe they need to adopt AI to stay competitive, 54% worry their organization lacks an AI plan\n\nMumbai, May 16, 2024: Microsoft and LinkedIn today released the India findings of the 2024 Work Trend Index on the state of AI at work. The report titled, \u201cAI at work is here. Now comes the hard part\u201d shows how, in just one year, AI is influencing the way people work, lead and hire. The report spotlights employees\u2019 strong desire for AI integration in the workplace, the opportunities it creates for career growth, and the emergence of AI power users[1] in the future of work.\n\nMicrosoft and LinkedIn partnered for the first time for the fourth Work Trend Index to provide a comprehensive view of how AI is shaping work. The findings are based on a survey of 31,000 people in 31 countries, labor and hiring trends on LinkedIn, trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals and research with Fortune 500 customers.\n\nThe report highlights insights every leader and professional needs to know about AI\u2019s impact on work, talent and hiring in the year ahead:\n\nEmployees want AI at work\u2014and won\u2019t wait for companies to catch up:\n\nIndia\u2019s workforce is very optimistic about AI. Ninety-two percent of knowledge workers in India use AI at work as compared to the global figure of 75%, reflecting employee confidence in AI to save time, boost creativity, and focus. Ninety-one percent of leaders in India also believe their companies need to adopt AI to stay competitive, 54% worry their organization lacks a plan and vision for implementation.\n\nWhile leaders feel the pressure to turn individual productivity gains into organizational impact, employees aren\u2019t waiting to reap the benefits: 72% of Indian AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work (BYOAI). The data is clear: people are turning to AI to be more productive and creative at work. The opportunity for every leader is to channel this momentum into ROI.\n\nFor employees, AI raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling:\n\nIn a world where AI mentions in LinkedIn job posts drive a 17% jump in response rate, it\u2019s a two-way street: organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract the best talent, and professionals who skill up in AI will have the edge.\n\nFor India\u2019s leaders, AI skills are now a top priority when it comes to hiring, with 75% stating they wouldn\u2019t hire someone lacking in AI skills, outpacing the global average of 66%. Interestingly, AI skills outweigh experience, with 80% of leaders in India preferring to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills, over a more experienced candidate without them.\n\nAs of late last year, there has been a 142x increase globally in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude.\n\nThe rise of the AI power user \u2014and what they reveal about the future:\n\nFour types of AI users emerged in the research\u2014from skeptics who rarely use AI to power users who use it extensively, with novices and explorers in between. Compared to skeptics, AI power users have fundamentally reoriented their workdays with 90% of Indian AI power users beginning their day with AI and 91% relying on it to prepare for the next day. They are also 37% more likely to seek guidance from co-workers regarding useful prompts and 47% more likely to experiment with AI.\n\nAI power users are nearly 20% more likely to receive training, particularly on prompts and role-specific AI usage, compared to other employees. They are also 65% more likely to receive communication from the CEO on generative AI, 34% more likely from the function or department lead, and 44% more likely from their manager\u2019s manager.\n\nIrina Ghose, managing director, Microsoft India and South Asia said, \u201cData from the Work Trend Index shows that AI is now a reality at work, with India having one of the highest AI adoption rates among knowledge workers, at 92%. The rate of diffusion we\u2019re seeing across sectors, from BFSI to healthcare to ITES and the public sector has been very encouraging. This AI optimism presents a tremendous opportunity for organizations to invest in the right tools and training, to unlock efficiencies for employees and ultimately drive long term business impact.\u201d\n\nRuchee Anand, head of Talent & Learning Solutions at LinkedIn said, \u201cAI is transforming the world of work, reshaping the talent landscape and nudging both individuals and organizations to embrace change. The demand for AI expertise has seen a remarkable 17% jump from last year, echoing LinkedIn platform insights and findings of the Work Trend Index. We\u2019ve seen professionals in India over index on learning while also adding AI skills to their professional toolkit. As the workforce looks to tap into the benefits of AI, it\u2019s crucial for leaders to boost their organization\u2019s AI capabilities through thoughtful investment in both technology and talent.\u201d\n\nUse of generative AI at work has nearly doubled in the last six months, globally. LinkedIn is seeing a significant increase in professionals adding AI skills to their profiles. However, with every second leader in India worried that their company lacks an AI vision and employees bringing their own AI tools to work, leaders have reached the hard part of any tech disruption: moving from experimentation to tangible business impact.\n\nOn the sidelines of the report, Microsoft announced new capabilities in Copilot for Microsoft 365 to help people get started with AI, and LinkedIn announced over 50 learning courses that are being made free to empower professionals at all levels to advance AI aptitude.\n\nSome of the new capabilities introduced in Copilot for Microsoft 365 include: Copilot will become more conversational by suggesting follow-up prompts or asking clarifying questions to provide the best response possible.\n\nA new chat interface in Copilot will proactively offer timely recommendations based on recent activity, like \u201cYou missed Tuesday\u2019s sales meeting. Here\u2019s a quick summary\u201d or flagging an important email for follow up.\n\nThe prompt box in Copilot will now have an auto complete experience, allowing users to get better results from their prompts. If you\u2019ve already written the prompt, a new rewrite feature will turn basic prompts into rich ones, grounded in your work meetings, documents and emails.\n\nUpdates to Copilot Lab will allow employees to create, publish, and manage prompts that are expressly tailored to their team.\n\nIn addition to the 50 new AI learning courses available for free through July 8, LinkedIn offers:\n\nAI-powered coaching with personalized content and conversational learning.\n\nAI-powered personalized takeaways on LinkedIn Feed offering insights, ideas and actions.\n\nAI-powered tools to assess fitment for a role based on experience and skills match, plus advice on how to stand out and suggestions for skill building.\n\nTo learn more, visit the Official Microsoft Blog, the 2024 Work Trend Index Report, and head to LinkedIn to hear more from the company\u2019s Chief Economist, Karin Kimbrough.\n\nAbout Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \u201cMSFT\u201d @microsoft) creates platforms and tools powered by AI to deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. The technology company is committed to making AI available broadly and doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\n\nAbout LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn connects the world\u2019s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the way companies hire, learn, market and sell. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world\u2019s first Economic Graph. LinkedIn has more than 1 billion members and has offices around the globe.\n\n[1] Power users are those who use AI extensively, at least several times per week",

The coming year promises to bring significant shifts in talent dynamics, as organizations balance economic uncertainties with the growing demand for specialized skills. 2025 is poised to be a year where strategic talent management will be more crucial than ever.\n\nSalary Increase Trends 2025: Strategic Differentiation Takes Center Stage\n\nThe compensation landscape in 2025 is expected to reflect a more nuanced approach to talent valuation. While the BFSI, Software & Internet, and Gaming sectors are anticipated to offer the most substantial salary increases, organizations are moving away from broad-brush approaches to compensation. Performance differentiation will become stricter, with companies maintaining double-digit salary increases for junior-level employees while creating clearer distinctions between high, average, and low performers.\n\nThe criticality of skills will emerge as a key factor in determining salary increases, particularly as Artificial Intelligence (AI) reshapes the talent landscape in 2025. Specialized AI roles are currently commanding premium increases of 35-55% during job transitions, a trend that\u2019s expected to intensify in 2025 and beyond as organizations compete for these increasingly essential capabilities.\n\nWhile core digital skills fetch packages between 16-106 lakhs, professionals with niche AI and specialized digital capabilities are securing substantially higher compensation ranging from 26-152 lakhs. Organizations are recognizing this widening compensation gap and recalibrating their strategies to not just attract but retain AI talent\u2014understanding that these specialized skills will be crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in an increasingly AI-driven future.\n\n2025 Attrition Forecast: A New Dynamic Emerge\n\n2025 may witness a slight uptick in Voluntary Attrition as market recovery gains momentum. The Software & Internet, BFSI, and Automotive industries are likely to experience the highest attrition rates. However, this isn\u2019t just about compensation \u2013 today\u2019s workforce, particularly Gen Z employees, prioritize purpose-driven work, positive environments, and meaningful roles.\n\nOrganizations are responding by focusing on preventing infant attrition, with 37% of GCCs proactively monitoring new hire quality. The emphasis is shifting towards creating comprehensive value propositions that address both financial and non-financial aspects of employee satisfaction.\n\n2025 Hiring Landscape: Strategic and Focused\n\nThe hiring landscape in 2025 will be characterized by strategic prudence. Companies are expected to adopt a lean and disciplined approach, moving away from the hire-and-fire cycles of previous years. While overall hiring may remain cautious, there\u2019s an anticipated uptick in fresher recruitment, particularly focusing on candidates with expertise in new-age specializations such as AI/ML, Data Science, Analytics, and Sustainability.\n\nA significant trend is the emergence of \u2018green jobs\u2019 as Sustainability becomes a key focus area. The International Labour Organization estimates this sector will create 24 Mn jobs globally by 2030, introducing roles like Sustainable Procurement Analysts, ESG Accounting Managers, and Green Finance Specialists.\n\n2025\u2019s Emerging Roles: The Next Generation of GCC Talent\n\n2025 will see the continued emergence of next-generation roles shaped by technological advancement and changing business needs. Traditional positions are evolving into specialized roles:\n\nHR roles will transform into future-ready positions such as Workplace Engagement Specialists, Gig Workforce Managers, and Neurodiversity Recruitment Specialists\n\nTraditional technology roles will evolve into next-gen specializations, with Software Engineers and Data Scientists moving into positions like Generative AI Architects, AI Research Scientists, and Emotional AI Specialists\n\nWith growing focus on environmental goals, 2025 will see the rise of roles like ESG Accounting Managers, Green Finance Specialists, and Sustainable Procurement Analysts\n\nSalary Increase Trends, Attrition, and Hiring: Strategic Approach for 2025\n\nAs we approach 2025, organizations must prepare for a year of strategic talent management. Success will depend on:\n\nBalancing cost optimization with competitive compensation for critical skills\n\nCreating robust learning and development frameworks\n\nBuilding sustainable talent pipelines, particularly in Tier-II cities\n\nDeveloping comprehensive employee value propositions that resonate with a purpose-driven workforce\n\nThe \u201cSalary Increase, Attrition & Hiring Trends: An India GCC View\u201d report provides detailed insights into these trends, helping organizations craft effective talent strategies for the year ahead.

        "text": "Today\u2019s job market is constantly shifting and recruiters need to work hard to keep up with the changes. A new report from consulting firm Korn Ferry sheds light on six talent hiring trends for recruiters in 2024.\n\nAI in recruitment\n\nAI is undoubtedly already transforming the way companies approach recruitment. It is not just about streamlining processes \u2013 it can also be an important tool for talent acquisition, offering fresh perspectives and new approaches.\n\nTools that use AI can help recruiters in a number of ways including quickly writing job descriptions, providing quick answers to questions with chatbots, and more effectively managing candidate profiles. AI can also be valuable for other time-saving functions like automated scheduling and assessments, for example.\n\nAI could also improve diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts in hiring. DE&I remains a top priority for many companies, but leaders often face hurdles funding initiatives, according to the report.\n\nThis is where AI comes into play: Talent leaders can use AI to enhance accessibility for candidates with disabilities through features like screen readers, voice commands, and captioning. While there are still risks and AI tools are not immune to bias, the majority of recruiters told Korn Ferry the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nAI for candidates\n\nIt is not just recruiters using AI, of course. With the huge popularity of openly available tools like ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, job searchers are also making their lives easier with the new technology.\n\nAI immensely simplifies tedious tasks like tailoring CVs, drafting cover letters, and hunting for open positions. When used correctly, these tools can help candidates stand out in a competitive and crowded field of applicants.\n\nApplicants that used AI in creating their CV saw an 8% higher hiring rate, 7.8% more job offers, and 8.4% higher wages, according to an MIT Sloan study. While there is some concern from recruiters that AI tools enable candidates to embellish or misrepresent qualifications on CVs, the reality is that AI is likely not making candidates any more dishonest than they would be otherwise.\n\nThe boost in success from CVs that use AI is likely due to high-potential candidates whose applications may have otherwise been ignored. Not everyone excels at presenting their qualifications, even the most qualified candidates.\n\nEarly career hiring\n\nLarge employers will increasingly look beyond the college-level talent pools towards candidates emerging from non-traditional higher education, technical schools, or even those still in high school. While entry-level hires do not offer the same technical skill and know-how of higher level candidates, they command lower salaries and can be an attractive choice when budgets are tight.\n\nMany younger candidates are not simply seeking jobs, but are looking for companies that value their overall well-being and personal development. In fact, data from the report shows 76% of Gen Z employees see learning and development as a key driver of work engagement.\n\nHiring for skills\n\nMany companies are embracing skills-based hiring \u2013 where they prioritize what candidates know over where they have been. This is seen as one approach to navigating the global talent crunch, which is could cost an estimated $8.5 trillion in lost annual revenue across the globe.\n\n\u201cRecent LinkedIn data reveals recruiters on the platform search for candidates by their skills 5 times more often than by their degrees. And the share of LinkedIn job postings that didn\u2019t require a professional degree grew by 36% over the course of 2022,\u201d reads the Korn Ferry report.\n\nEmpathy takes center stage\n\nPrecipitated by the pandemic and the huge changes to working life that came with it, organizations have increasingly being putting people at the top of their agendas, helping employees better take care of themselves and their families. That is a trend that is very likely to continue into 2024.\n\nA Korn Ferry survey from last year found that 32% of employees found their CEO lacked empathy, a bit higher than the previous year. That is a big problem for companies that want to attract new talent and hold onto high performing talent.\n\nRelocation could make a big comeback\n\nRelocating for a dream job was a no-brainer just some years before the pandemic. But now, with all the changes brought on by the huge uptick in remote work, job searchers are far less likely to agree to move for work.\n\nA survey from 2023 found that fewer than 2% of American professionals moved for work that year. That is far lower than the 45% that reported relocating for their job in 1986.\n\nThere is a big push from business leaders for employees to return to the office. Over 90% of employees surveyed said that their boss wants their teams back in the office. Many of those surveyed reported considering quitting rather than going back into work as they did pre-pandemic.",

        "text": "AI in 2024: Five trends workers need to know\n\n5 January 2024 Share Save Leah Carroll Features correspondent Share Save\n\nAlamy One of the biggest opportunities for AI in 2024 is driving inclusion across the workforce (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe influence of artificial intelligence stands to make an even bigger impact this year in areas including hiring bias, inclusivity, regulation and more.\n\nAs much as 2023 marked a turning point for artificial intelligence, AI is poised to make an even bigger impact in 2024. Yet this time, workers are ready.\n\nNow that generative AI has been on employees' radars for more than a year, they're not only better positioned to understand its place in the contemporary work landscape, but also equipped to embrace the changes and possibility that comes with it.\n\nIt's time to put that advantage to use. To get ahead, workers should know what's coming in the AI space, including these five trends that are poised to impact the year.\n\n1. AI will encourage widespread inclusivity\n\nArtificial intelligence is likely to become a powerful tool for workers with disabilities \u2013 and those advances could drive change for all people.\n\nFirst, many machine-learning tools developed to benefit disabled workers could become increasingly available, believes Victor Santiago Pineda, director of the Inclusive Cities Lab at UC Berkeley, US. Think, for instance, algorithm-based speech-to-text and text-to-speech tools that provide additional information to visually- and hearing-impaired users, respectively.\n\n\"AI-powered assistive technologies have the potential to break down barriers and empower individuals with disabilities, fostering a sense of independence and inclusion,\" he says.\n\nHe believes the mainstream adoption of tools meant to assist disabled people can also benefit everyone. For example, as large language models continue to refine real-time, multilingual closed captioning, all people will have access to a wider and more diverse range of information.\n\n2. AI will make hiring \u2013 and layoff \u2013 processes more equitable\n\nHuman-resource professionals are already prepared to use artificial intelligence in the hiring process to create a more equitable hiring landscape, but the current technology is far from perfect. In response, academics and industry experts are working to reduce algorithmic bias on electronic hiring platforms and other HR tools through AI.\n\nSome experts are already prioritising these goals. The Hire Aspirations Institute, led by Cynthia Dwork, professor of computer science at the Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, is focused on identifying bias in screening tools and the professionals who use them.\n\nAlamy Tools to help workers with disabilities may proliferate, and these advances stand to help all workers (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBeyond the hiring process, some companies, including the global consultancy firm Deloitte, are using artificial intelligence technology to retain talent. The firm is currently experimenting with using AI data to more effectively reallocate budgets, move workers to more in-demand positions and, in turn, stave off layoffs. This could particularly help marginalised groups, who are often the targets of corporate cuts.\n\nHowever, many experts and HR professionals agree that although AI development will be helpful in creating a more diverse candidate funnel, it may not be able to solve all issues, including human bias in hiring. However, a heightened awareness of hiring inequity may help HR professionals understand their own implicit judgements and how to move past them.\n\n3. Workplaces will use AI to centre diversity in hiring and training\n\nBeyond levelling the playing field for applications, evolving AI tools may also help to ensure traditionally marginalised people are not starting a new job on the back foot.\n\nTo begin, the development of AI may push regulators to increasingly focus on funding worker inclusion practices in the public and private sectors. In its recent Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP), the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission prioritised overcoming workplace discrimination in an increasingly AI assisted world. In the EU, the newly passed AI act requires that HR data and processes at firms must meet established standards for workers' rights, or face corporate fines.\n\nInvestment in inclusive technology such as language-learning models designed by diverse teams, for instance, stands to help employers create personalised educational programs tailored to a wide set of employee experiences. This has the potential to help workers from all backgrounds get the same start.\n\nImportantly, these kinds of changes stand to impact how hiring platforms are designed. Addressing bias in the development of algorithms can head off exclusionary practices from the start of the hiring process, instead of working to make up for mistakes and blind spots after they show themselves. Experts say this could make a real difference, as they point to the importance of creating inclusive teams at the development stage of AI technology to help all workers have an equal chance to advance.\n\n4. Employees want to work with AI, and employers will invest in upskilling\n\nWhile some experts say concerns about AI replacing some roles are valid, they also have simultaneously predicted that it won't eliminate all human jobs. Instead, workers will evolve to co-exist with this emerging technology, and the employees who are willing to learn and adapt to AI will see the greatest benefits.\n\nAlamy Getting diverse groups into the development of AI from the outset can head off exclusionary practices (Credit: Alamy)\n\nFor many, this will require re-training in specific areas and employer-sponsored learning opportunities. A 2023 survey conducted by Jobs for the Future's Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work (JFF) showed the majority of respondents believe they will need new skills to compete in an AI-driven workforce. Younger workers are particularly feeling the pressure: 66% of Gen Z and millennial respondents said they felt the need to hone and update their skillsets to maintain a competitive edge.\n\nCompanies may increasingly rise to the occasion, offering better resources for upskilling, through programmes such as in-office workshops, partnerships with academic institutions, mentoring schemes and trials that expose workers to multiple parts of the business. Experts at the JFF report that companies that invest stand to drive employee success and also have a business edge in the wider competitive landscape.\n\n5. AI regulation will continue to struggle to keep pace with the technology\n\nAI will come with benefits, but implementation of these advancements won't necessarily be smooth sailing.\n\nAs AI has come into mainstream usage, some technology leaders are calling for a push to define its boundaries. Regulators are tasked with expanding the technology, while also protecting the rights \u2013 and occupations \u2013 of a diverse human workforce. In the meantime, as AI becomes commonplace in many industries, experts say that a successful framework for regulation will require global collaboration from corporations, governments and academic researchers.\n\nAs the rapid advances in AI technology threaten to outpace efforts to create a flexible and comprehensive framework for its use, workers may be left concerned about job protections, privacy in the workplace and industry shifts. These concerns have real-life consequences \u2013 according to the American Psychological Association's 2023 Workplace in America survey, respondents who were worried about AI affecting their jobs reported greater amounts of stress, anxiety and professional burnout, than those who embraced the technology.",

        "text": "AI job postings have risen in recent months after dropping from their peak in March 2022. This pickup is due to a shift toward AI jobs in a few sectors, particularly Software Development.\n\nKey Points:\n\nAI-related job postings are rising, hitting 2% of all jobs at the end of February 2024. But AI-related postings are still short of their recent peak of 3.3%, reached in March 2022.\n\nAI-related job postings remain well below their recent high because job postings are depressed in the sectors most likely to list AI jobs, including Mathematics and Software Development.\n\nThe recent uptick in AI job postings is attributable not to a pick-up in job postings in AI-heavy sectors, but rather an increase in the AI share of job postings, particularly for Software Development jobs.\n\nOur monthly Labor Market Update looks at an important labor market trend through the lens of Indeed data. A more comprehensive view of the US labor market can be found in our US Labor Market Overview chartbook. Data from our Job Postings Index \u2014 which stands 18% above its pre-pandemic baseline as of March 8 \u2014 and the Indeed Wage Tracker are regularly updated, and can be downloaded on our data portal and GitHub.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI), and artificial intelligence (AI) tools more broadly, may destroy jobs in the future. But today, both technologies are already creating new jobs, and have been for a while.\n\nGenAI, which can produce text, images, and audio, captured the world\u2019s attention when it exploded onto the scene in late 2022. The tools\u2019 new capabilities have provoked speculation \u2014 and fear \u2014 over how jobs may change or even be eliminated in the near future as the tools improve. At the moment, Hiring Lab research suggests GenAI is more likely to augment certain roles, rather than fully replace them. Which is not yet stopping the tremendous growth in adoption and development of the tools. While still a very small share of total US jobs, GenAI-related jobs have grown rapidly since January 2023, from just 3 in 100,000 job postings to 11 in 10,000 as of the end of February 2024, a more than 30-fold increase.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cGen AI jobs are rare, but they are growing quickly\u201d covering from January 2022 through February 2024. The graph shows an almost nonexistent level of Gen AI jobs until very rapid growth from the beginning of 2023 until February 2024.\n\nBut companies have been hiring for roles related to other AI skills and technologies more broadly \u2014 think machine learning or machine vision \u2014 for years. However, growth in broader AI jobs is far more muted than growth in GenAI-specific jobs, even as the total level of broad AI jobs remains much higher. AI-related job postings have been rising since last summer, but their share of overall postings is still well below its recent peak.\n\nAt the end of February, 2% of job postings on Indeed included AI-related keywords, up from a recent low of 1.64% in June 2023, but well below the 3.3% peak registered in March 2022. Given the anticipation and excitement about AI, why are postings for the field stifled?\n\nA line graph titled \u201cAI jobs are bouncing back, but remain below their 2022 peak\u201d showing the share of AI-related jobs in the US from January 2019 through February 2024. The graph shows a large rise in 2021 in the AI job postings share and then a dramatic drop until June 2023. The AI share then rises through February 2024.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s clear that the recent wave of enthusiasm around AI has centered on GenAI more specifically. But more broadly, the AI labor market is deeply connected to the tech labor market \u2014 and postings for tech-related jobs overall are currently depressed. Consider the two occupational sectors with the highest share of broadly AI-related job postings: Mathematics and Software Development. As of Feb. 29, postings for Mathematics roles are down 58% since March 2022, when AI job postings peaked, according to the Indeed Job Postings Index. The pullback is more severe within the Software Development sector, with postings down 67% over the same period.\n\nSo, does this mean that the recent increase in AI jobs can be attributed to an uptick in the broader tech labor market? In short, no. Postings for Mathematics and Software Development are down 3.5% and 11%, respectively, since June 2023 (the recent low point for AI-related job postings). The increase in the overall AI-related job share since then is attributable primarily to a rise in the share of jobs within specific sectors that are related to AI. In other words, job postings specifically related to AI are on the upswing, even as job postings within the category overall continue to slide. The rising AI-related share of Software Development jobs has been the largest contributor to the overall AI-related job share increase since bottoming out last June. Almost a quarter (22%) of Software Development jobs were AI-related at the end of February, up from 19% in June 2023. The overall tech labor market might not be rebounding, but our data suggests employers are starting to pivot back toward AI jobs.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cAI jobs are on the rise in the Software Development sector\u201d showing the AI share of Software Development jobs from January 2019 to February 2024. The AI share in this sector rose from 2019 through early 2022 before falling until summer 2023. The share is now rising and is almost at its March 2022 peak.\n\nThe short-term outlook for AI jobs will likely remain tied to the overall tech market, and a larger increase in the AI share will require a broader rebound in tech job postings as a whole. But it also seems clear that tech employers are shifting more toward AI. For job seekers, this trend means tilting their interests and skills toward artificial intelligence if they want to land a tech role. More broadly, increased hiring for AI-related jobs points toward deeper corporate investments in these technologies. The possible returns on these investments, and their effects on productivity, are uncertain, exciting, and potentially anxiety-inducing all at once. We\u2019ll continue to track AI jobs to get a better sense of how this trend progresses.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe AI share of job postings is calculated by extracting job postings related to AI generally, using a broader list of keywords indicating skills associated with AI. This category of job postings includes Generative AI job postings.\n\nThe analysis involved extracting job postings directly related to Generative AI, using specific keywords indicating its presence, such as \u201cGenerative AI,\u201d \u201cLarge Language Models,\u201d and \u201cChat GPT.\u201d",

        "text": "These human biases tend to pose significant barriers to equitable hiring, he says, but adding AI to the equation gives humans the opportunity to reflect. \"It will give the human pause if there's a machine decision that's different from theirs, and it makes it more likely that the human, even if they are the final decision maker, will question their own motivations for why they prefer one candidate over another,\" Sundararajan said.\n\n\"Although AI systems may be biased in certain ways because of the data that they're trained on, they don't have personalities that display explicit prejudice or subconscious bias learned over time,\" said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at NYU Stern School of Business studying AI's impact on myriad facets of life and a member of the Artificial Intelligence Governance Alliance for the World Economic Forum .\n\nDespite the risks, Viramontes believes in the potential for AI-enabled hiring to reduce bias in the process, and he's not alone.\n\n\"We know there's bias in the way that we've done things historically,\" said Viramontes. Replaying past mistakes in a novel form, he suggests, could make the woes of hiring worse. Not only can human bias impact algorithmic bias, but research also suggests that the reverse can be true. Two researchers from Deusto University in Spain, Luc\u00eda Vicente and Helena Matute , found that humans reproduce digitally enacted AI bias in the real world.\n\nHistorical data is at the root of many AI hiring solutions, notes Jamie Viramontes, CEO and founder of Konnect who formerly headed HR for brands like Forever 21, Chipotle and St. Francis Medical Center.\n\nFor HR, fear of AI's unknown repercussions \u2014 in practice and in regulatory pushback \u2014 is causing angst. That fear hasn't halted the promises that various AI applications make, namely mitigating the longstanding bias that exists in the hiring framework.\n\nThe latest generation of artificial intelligence is officially old enough for human-centered business controversy, with companies like OpenAI and Microsoft embedded in the debate. Even with this so-called milestone, many industries remain hesitant to test the AI waters to their fullest capacity, including human resources.\n\nAccording to the 2023 Talent Index from AI-powered talent lifecycle management platform Beamery, 59% of people looking for work say they've noticed AI being used during the recruitment process. Half of respondents said they've used it for recruitment themselves.\n\nWhile AI usage in the hiring process remains elementary in many cases (in the form of chatbots and scheduling assistants, for example), there's no ignoring its presence \u2014 and the potential for bias to improve or worsen as a result.\n\nThe 2023 American Staffing Association Workforce Monitor reports that 34% of people see AI hiring tools as more prone to bias than humans alone. There are measures companies can take, experts say, to fight against this, but it requires a concerted effort from policymakers and corporate decision makers alike.\n\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission published a four-year strategic enforcement plan beginning in fiscal year 2024 that includes AI's impact on bias. Recognizing employers' increasing use of this technology, the EEOC is focusing on how it targets job advertisements, recruits applicants or makes or assists in hiring decisions \"where such systems intentionally exclude or adversely impact protected groups.\"\n\nWhile government agencies continue on the road to firm directives, self-regulation is an interim solution. Though self-regulation lacks a level of powerful oversight that makes these policies broadly effective, it is, to some, better than a free-for-all that could further marginalize groups of people who are already on the outskirts of equity (or marginalize entirely different groups of people based on imperfect outcomes we have yet to witness).\n\nHiring the right AI\n\nAs organizations assess AI vendors to assist them in the hiring process, there are questions they can ask to ensure they're signing on with a trustworthy, knowledgeable vendor that's actively interested in equitable outcomes for all.\n\nWith every organization having distinct recruiting needs, it's important to ask the vendor if the algorithm can be customized to take advantage of internal data, Sundararajan says.\n\nAnother question Sundararajan suggests asking is: What measures are you taking to debias your algorithm? Chances are the technology provider will put you in touch with someone who will take you through their process of debiasing and show you the extent to which they're paying attention to this issue, he says.\n\n\"Machine learning systems can reconstruct these variables, even if you suppress them. Knowing that your vendor is sophisticated enough, for example, to even understand that problem and take care of it, that's step one,\" Sundararajan added. \"But then, what are the more nuanced ways in which they're debiasing their systems?\"\n\nFinally, he says to ask about the extent to which they use your data to improve the system's performance for other clients. In other words, he said, \"To what extent is your proprietary data proprietary to you?\"\n\nHow HR should start experimenting\n\nThe machine learning process has three key components contributing to algorithmic bias, according to researcher Zhisheng Chen from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China: dataset construction, the engineer's target formulation and feature selection. It's in these components that algorithmic debiasing takes place, and technological tools like data blending, decoupling and differential testing can help the process.\n\nOn the human front, Viramontes said one key aspect is \"having checks and balances from an HR perspective, but also having checks and balances between the HR team and the hiring manager.\" This, he says, includes tools like unconscious bias training and proactive diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nSundararajan adds that when companies adopt AI tools, the recruiting team on the front lines needs to make material changes to how they hire. \"Human beings have a tendency to trust their judgments over the judgment of a decision support system that's been given to them,\" he said. \"How do we make sure that the top management's vision of de-biasing hiring with the use of AI translates into actual process changes on the front lines so that the AI systems aren't just acquired, they're actually used?\"\n\nAs HR professionals and hiring managers ease into AI with all of its risks and opportunities in mind, Viramontes suggests starting with lower-risk processes such as improving the health insurance enrollment process for employees.\n\n\"We know that there's a huge reduction in turnover if employees are having a great experience with open enrollment,\" said Viramontes. As teams have more wins in these areas, he adds, they may become more open to AI's potential in hiring.",

        "text": "HR and recruitment teams are beginning to use AI tools in multiple stages of the hiring process.\n\nThis tech-driven approach can help hiring leaders evaluate candidates' r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and skills faster.\n\nStill, experts say using AI in recruitment requires careful execution to avoid bias.\n\nThis article is part of \"Build IT,\" a series about digital-tech trends disrupting industries.\n\nFilling an open role at a company can be a difficult, time-consuming experience for recruiters. It could take several weeks, or even months, for hiring managers to parse through applications and set up interviews.\n\nBut with 67% of human-resources professionals in a survey from the customer-service platform Tidio saying they see the value in artificial-intelligence tools, it's clear the hiring process is in a major transition.\n\nTech leaders and scholars told Business Insider that HR and recruitment teams were increasingly using AI tools at multiple stages of the hiring process \u2014 from reviewing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to short-listing candidates \u2014 while developing ethical parameters to temper the risks and biases of AI. They predicted the tools would make the hiring process faster for HR workers and could even prove valuable to job seekers.\n\nThe future of recruitment can be more streamlined and automated with AI, experts say\n\nFrom sourcing talent to answering standard candidate questions, some experts believe AI tools could make the hiring process better and faster.\n\nLindsey Zuloaga, the chief data scientist at the AI-based hiring company HireVue, told BI that clients have used her company's AI-powered tools, such as chat-based job matching, to \"automate mundane tasks and improve fairness in their processes.\"\n\nApplying AI technologies to the recruitment process may also \"redefine how organizations source talent and how HR teams operate,\" Pamela Maynard, the CEO of the IT consulting firm Avanade, said. For example, she told BI, AI helps recruiters leverage big data to get through tasks such as \"analyzing CVs and job applications,\" as well as \"sourcing and screening candidates\" quicker.\n\n\"By matching the skills and experience on the supply side with business/client demands, recruiters will be able to more quickly review/assess the suitability of the individual to a role,\" she said.\n\nAI technologies, Maynard said, have the power to improve efficiencies within recruitment departments as well.\n\n\"Depending on the quality of data that the recruitment team has, AI can even carry out activity that usually requires human intelligence, such as predicting a candidate's success ahead of hiring and even how they may fit culturally in an organization,\" she said.\n\n\"AI can use data to look at the candidate's skills, background, and experience to determine how successful they will be in a role before hiring them,\" she added. \"For example, AI can look at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the applicants and rank them based on how well they match to qualifications of prior successful candidates, using information such as education, skills, achievements, and interests.\"\n\nDespite this, Paolo Pescatore, a tech analyst, told BI that changes in a person's emotions and personal circumstances, or in a company's objectives and internal culture, could \"impact performance.\" \"Too much focus is being placed on AI,\" he added, at a time when the technology is still in its infancy.\n\nHow AI could benefit job candidates\n\nThe emergence of AI-driven talent-intelligence tools stands to benefit job seekers, Alexandra Levit, a workforce consultant and futurist, said. She told BI that machine-learning methods could analyze candidates' adjacent, transferable skills, giving them a fighting chance to pursue a new career with little to no direct experience. AI can also flag these skills to recruiters and help them ensure the candidate would be a good fit for the role in question.\n\n\"It also helps determine current organizational capabilities and future needs by taking into account a global dataset of standardized job descriptions and requirements,\" Levit added.\n\nShe said that talent-intelligence platforms pulled \"millions of profiles and job descriptions\" from the internet, using this information to \"predict what people will do next in their careers,\" as well as any skills they \"aren't listing or talking about.\"\n\n\"Recruiters can also use these platforms to conduct competitor analysis and work out the most important skills in their sector,\" she added.\n\nRoger Philby, the founder and CEO of the Chemistry Group, a business-management consultancy, said other capabilities of AI-based predictive models were scoring candidates and ensuring \"assessment results relate to job performance.\" This can be used to \"provide candidates with actionable feedback that's more meaningful and delivered in plain language,\" he added. For instance, this could be feedback on how a candidate did in an interview and ways they could improve in future interviews, he added.\n\nSome say AI tools could make recruiting more fair\n\nWhile there's plenty of evidence of bias in AI , Zuloaga of HireVue said she'd seen her company's tools increase the diversity of talent pools for many clients.\n\n\"As compared with human decision-making, many of our customers see an increase in diversity when hiring processes are highly standardized and use algorithms that are optimized with fairness in mind,\" she said. \"With AI, we can tune out any unnecessary information that can lead to adverse impact towards demographic groups.\"\n\nSeun Kolade, a professor of entrepreneurship and digital transformation at Sheffield Business School, told BI he agreed that AI could help recruiters make the hiring process more fair but said it's not a \"magic wand.\" Recruiters can realize the benefits of AI technologies, he added, only when their algorithms are \"carefully designed and properly trained.\"\n\nHe added that recruiters should view AI technology \"as an assistant\" and \"not a replacement,\" stressing the importance of having \"diverse hiring committees who can offer a wider range of perspectives,\" in addition to \"balanced decision-making.\"\n\nBut beware: AI recruitment can still be risky\n\nWhile AI technology is helping recruiters in many ways, there are some risks to consider and mitigate.\n\nIn 2022, researchers at Cambridge University found that AI recruitment tools weren't capable of eradicating bias or boosting diversity during the hiring process. And in 2018, Amazon ditched its plans to use an AI hiring tool after it showed prejudice against female applicants. Amazon, along with Unilever, Microsoft, and others, has since signed on to a set of principles and protocols for trustworthy AI-based hiring solutions.\n\nThese problems often arise because of biased historical data used for training AI recruitment technologies, Maynard said. She added that when this was the case, AI tools might \"make unfair or discriminatory decisions\" regarding \"gender, race, age, or other protected characteristics.\"\n\n\"When the percentage of developers building AI models and solutions largely represent one ethnic, gender, and age group, the risk of bias and discrimination in future iterations is too great,\" she said. \"It is essential to carefully monitor and address bias in AI recruitment tools and increase diversity and inclusion in the teams that are designing the tools.\"\n\nTo comply with evolving AI regulations and use automated recruitment tools safely, Levit advises firms to create a code of conduct that outlines what technology should and shouldn't be used for.\n\nCompanies can also \"boost morale\" in their recruitment and HR teams by communicating to employees that AI hiring tools won't replace them en masse, Levit told BI.\n\nRecruiters might struggle to spot bias in AI recruitment tools, like ChatGPT, that pull information from unverified online sources, Annie Jackson, the head of talent at the AI-powered financial-budgeting app Cleo , said.\n\nJackson recommended that companies develop strict policies governing the use of AI hiring tools and provide their recruitment teams with bias training. Additionally, because automated hiring tools are powered by large datasets, implementing robust data protection and security measures should be another critical priority for recruitment teams that use AI.\n\nDeveloping an effective AI recruitment strategy\n\nParul Mishra, the vice president of digital labor-product management at IBM, said recruitment and HR teams that want to begin using AI in their processes should choose easy-to-use tools.\n\n\"Highly technical solutions may not be the best fit for your team,\" she told BI. \"Instead, look for tools that are low touch and low code .\"\n\nAnother important step for incorporating AI into recruiting and hiring strategies is \"getting everyone on board with a responsible AI framework that ensures trust and transparency,\" Maynard said.\n\nThis should determine where AI has the most potential to solve a business challenge and how it can deliver the most immediate impact, Maynard said, adding that it should establish clear guidelines that honor corporate values.\n\nOrganizations must \"create clear processes for managing and mitigating risks, set clear performance-management objectives, and document all proposed and implemented AI use cases\" when using the technology as part of their recruitment efforts, she added.\n\nIt's also essential for recruiters to \"become familiar with different offerings and explore unique ways to use this technology,\" Mishra said. \"AI may not replace recruiters, but the recruiters that use AI will replace those that do not.\"",

        "text": "Half of graduates feel threatened by AI (46%) and question their workforce readiness (52%)\n\n59% of employers say AI has caused them to prioritize different skills when hiring, including \"uniquely human\" skills\n\nHalf of employers have dropped degree requirements for entry-level roles\n\nBOSTON, July 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The job landscape has been completely transformed. In response to workplace transitions like The Great Resignation, Quiet Quitting and now the rise and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), employer hiring habits continue to evolve with 50% of employers now admitting they've dropped 2- and 4-year degree requirements for entry-level positions (a 32% increase over 2022) and started prioritizing softer skills and previous job experience (66%).\n\nData from the 2023 Cengage Group Employability Survey tracks opinions on key workforce trends among recent graduates and employers.\n\nAnd while these shifts signal a move toward skills-based hiring (over degree-based hiring), it also introduces new uncertainties for graduates.\n\nAccording to Cengage Group's 2023 Employability Report \u2013 the third annual report surveying 1,000 graduates who completed a degree or non-degree program in the last 12 months and 1,000 U.S. hiring decisionmakers \u2013 the growth of emerging technologies, like generative AI, have a third of grads second-guessing their career choice. Additionally, more than half (52%) of graduates say competition from AI has them questioning how prepared they are for the workforce.\n\n\"The workplace has changed rapidly in the last few years, and now we are witnessing a new shift as AI begins to reshape worker productivity, job requirements, hiring habits and even entire industries,\" said Michael Hansen, CEO of Cengage Group. \"With new technology comes both new uncertainties and new opportunities for the workforce, and educators and employers must do more to prepare today's workers for these technological shifts.\"\n\nData shows that educators still have work to do in preparing graduates. Just 41% of grads said their program taught them skills needed for their first job \u2013 down from 63% who said the same in 2022. Recent graduates report they are not getting enough preparation to develop \"soft skills,\" something employers say they will prioritize more with the growth of AI. Nearly 3 in 5 grads (58%) believe closer alignment between employers and learning institutions would help them develop important workplace skills.\n\nAdditional findings include:\n\nThe struggle for talent is still very real and has forced employers to do things differently. Half of employers (53%) struggle to find talent (down from 65% in 2022), which has improved their willingness to interview candidates with experience but no degree (66%; up from 53% in 2022). Additionally, employers are more open to upskilling with nearly half of employers (48%) admitting they will hire talent with some but not all the skills needed for a role and upskill them, and 17% open to finding and upskilling talent from within the company.\n\nHalf of employers (53%) struggle to find talent (down from 65% in 2022), which has improved their willingness to interview candidates with experience but no degree (66%; up from 53% in 2022).

Dropping degree requirements has increased grad confidence. With half of employers dropping degree requirements on entry-level job listings, grads are more confidently applying to jobs with 3 in 5 (61%) employers seeing an uptick in non-degree applicants. In fact, recent degree and non-degree graduates are feeling more confident regarding their qualifications to apply for entry-level jobs, with only one-third (33%) stating they felt underqualified, down significantly from the last two years in which roughly half of graduates felt underqualified.\n\nWith half of employers dropping degree requirements on entry-level job listings, grads are more confidently applying to jobs with 3 in 5 (61%) employers seeing an uptick in non-degree applicants. In fact, recent degree and non-degree graduates are feeling more confident regarding their qualifications to apply for entry-level jobs, with only one-third (33%) stating they felt underqualified, down significantly from the last two years in which roughly half of graduates felt underqualified. There's still work to be done to connect education to the workforce. Half of all graduates (49%) say their educational institution should be held accountable for placing them in jobs upon graduation, however fewer graduates gained important workforce experience before graduating. Less than half of graduates (47%) participated in an internship, externship or apprenticeship this year, compared with 63% in 2022. Of those graduates who did, more than a third (35%) did not receive any guidance from their school in finding the opportunity.\n\nHalf of all graduates (49%) say their educational institution should be held accountable for placing them in jobs upon graduation, however fewer graduates gained important workforce experience before graduating.

With more than half of employers (57%) saying certain entry level jobs, teams and skills could be replaced by AI, they are calling for employees to upskill. More than two-thirds of employers (68%) say many of their employees will need to reskill or upskill in the next 3-5 years because of emerging technology and grads agree \u2013 3 in 5 (61%) say they will need to develop or strengthen their digital skills due to AI. The good news for employers: graduates (65%) recognize that and say they need more training in working alongside new technology.\n\n\"No part of the workforce is immune to the changes AI will bring. Many workers will need to develop new skills to work alongside new technology or perhaps even find new careers as a result of AI disruption. As we collectively navigate these changes, we are laser-focused on helping people develop in demand skills and connect to sustainable employment,\" said Hansen.\n\nFor more information on the 2023 Cengage Group Graduate Employability Report, click here.

        "text": "You have reached a page with older survey data. Please see our 2024 survey results here\n\nAdoption has more than doubled since 2017, though the proportion of organizations using AI has plateaued between 50 and 60 percent for the past few years. A set of companies seeing the highest financial returns from AI continue to pull ahead of competitors. The results show these leaders making larger investments in AI, engaging in increasingly advanced practices known to enable scale and faster AI development, and showing signs of faring better in the tight market for AI talent. On talent, for the first time, we looked closely at AI hiring and upskilling. The data show that there is significant room to improve diversity on AI teams, and, consistent with other studies, diverse teams correlate with outstanding performance.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Five years in review: AI adoption, impact, and spend\n\nThis marks the fifth consecutive year we\u2019ve conducted research globally on AI\u2019s role in business, and we have seen shifts over this period.\n\n2. Mind the gap: AI leaders pulling ahead\n\nOver the past five years we have tracked the leaders in AI\u2014we refer to them as AI high performers\u2014and examined what they do differently. We see more indications that these leaders are expanding their competitive advantage than we find evidence that others are catching up.\n\nFirst, we haven\u2019t seen an expansion in the size of the leader group. For the past three years, we have defined AI high performers as those organizations that respondents say are seeing the biggest bottom-line impact from AI adoption\u2014that is, 20 percent or more of EBIT from AI use. The proportion of respondents falling into that group has remained steady at about 8 percent. The findings indicate that this group is achieving its superior results mainly from AI boosting top-line gains, as they\u2019re more likely to report that AI is driving revenues rather than reducing costs, though they do report AI decreasing costs as well.\n\nNext, high performers are more likely than others to follow core practices that unlock value, such as linking their AI strategy to business outcomes (Exhibit 1). Also important, they are engaging more often in \u201cfrontier\u201d practices that enable AI development and deployment at scale, or what some call the \u201cindustrialization of AI.\u201d For example, leaders are more likely to have a data architecture that is modular enough to accommodate new AI applications rapidly. They also often automate most data-related processes, which can both improve efficiency in AI development and expand the number of applications they can develop by providing more high-quality data to feed into AI algorithms. And AI high performers are 1.6 times more likely than other organizations to engage nontechnical employees in creating AI applications by using emerging low-code or no-code programs, which allow companies to speed up the creation of AI applications. In the past year, high performers have become even more likely than other organizations to follow certain advanced scaling practices, such as using standardized tool sets to create production-ready data pipelines and using an end-to-end platform for AI-related data science, data engineering, and application development that they\u2019ve developed in-house.\n\nHigh performers might also have a head start on managing potential AI-related risks, such as personal privacy and equity and fairness, that other organizations have not addressed yet. While overall, we have seen little change in organizations reporting recognition and mitigation of AI-related risks since we began asking about them four years ago, respondents from AI high performers are more likely than others to report that they engage in practices that are known to help mitigate risk. These include ensuring AI and data governance, standardizing processes and protocols, automating processes such as data quality control to remove errors introduced through manual work, and testing the validity of models and monitoring them over time for potential issues.\n\nAI use and sustainability efforts The survey findings suggest that many organizations that have adopted AI are integrating AI capabilities into their sustainability efforts and are also actively seeking ways to reduce the environmental impact of their AI use (exhibit). Of respondents from organizations that have adopted AI, 43 percent say their organizations are using AI to assist in sustainability efforts, and 40 percent say their organizations are working to reduce the environmental impact of their AI use by minimizing the energy used to train and run AI models. As companies that have invested more in AI and have more mature AI efforts than others, high performers are 1.4 times more likely than others to report AI-enabled sustainability efforts as well as to say their organizations are working to decrease AI-related emissions. Both efforts are more commonly seen at organizations based in Greater China, Asia\u2013Pacific, and developing markets, while respondents in North America are least likely to report them. When asked about the types of sustainability efforts using AI, respondents most often mention initiatives to improve environmental impact, such as optimization of energy efficiency or waste reduction. AI use is least common in efforts to improve organizations\u2019 social impact (for example, sourcing of ethically made products), though respondents working for North American organizations are more likely than their peers to report that use.\n\nInvestment is yet another area that could contribute to the widening of the gap: AI high performers are poised to continue outspending other organizations on AI efforts. Even though respondents at those leading organizations are just as likely as others to say they\u2019ll increase investments in the future, they\u2019re spending more than others now, meaning they\u2019ll be increasing from a base that is a higher percentage of revenues. Respondents at AI high performers are nearly eight times more likely than their peers to say their organizations spend at least 20 percent of their digital-technology budgets on AI-related technologies. And these digital budgets make up a much larger proportion of their enterprise spend: respondents at AI high performers are over five times more likely than other respondents to report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent of their enterprise-wide revenue on digital technologies.\n\nFinally, all of this may be giving AI high performers a leg up in attracting AI talent. There are indications that these organizations have less difficulty hiring for roles such as AI data scientist and data engineer. Respondents from organizations that are not AI high performers say filling those roles has been \u201cvery difficult\u201d much more often than respondents from AI high performers do.\n\nThe bottom line: high performers are already well positioned for sustained AI success, improved efficiency in new AI development, and a resultingly more attractive environment for talent. The good news for organizations outside the leader group is that there\u2019s a clear blueprint of best practices for success.\n\n3. AI talent tales: New hot roles, continued diversity woes\n\nOur first detailed look at the AI talent picture signals the maturation of AI, surfaces the most common strategies organizations employ for talent sourcing and upskilling, and shines a light on AI\u2019s diversity problem\u2014while showing yet again a link between diversity and success.\n\nHiring is a challenge, but less so for high performers\n\nAll organizations report that hiring AI talent, particularly data scientists, remains difficult. AI high performers report slightly less difficulty and hired some roles, like machine learning engineers, more often than other organizations.\n\nReskilling and upskilling are common alternatives to hiring\n\nWhen it comes to sourcing AI talent, the most popular strategy among all respondents is reskilling existing employees. Nearly half are doing so. Recruiting from top-tier universities as well as from technology companies that aren\u2019t in the top tier, such as regional leaders, are also common strategies. But a look at the strategies of high performers suggests organizations might be best served by tapping as many recruiting channels as possible (Exhibit 2). These companies are doing more than others to recruit AI-related talent from various sources. The findings show that while they\u2019re more likely to recruit from top-tier technical universities and tech companies, they\u2019re also more likely to source talent from other universities, training academies, and diversity-focused programs or professional organizations.\n\nResponses suggest that both AI high performers and other organizations are upskilling technical and nontechnical employees on AI, with nearly half of respondents at both AI high performers and other organizations saying they are reskilling as a way of gaining more AI talent. However, high performers are taking more steps than other organizations to build employees\u2019 AI-related skills.\n\nRespondents at high performers are nearly three times more likely than other respondents to say their organizations have capability-building programs to develop technology personnel\u2019s AI skills. The most common approaches they use are experiential learning, self-directed online courses, and certification programs, whereas other organizations most often lean on self-directed online courses.\n\nHigh performers are also much more likely than other organizations to go beyond providing access to self-directed online course work to upskill nontechnical employees on AI. Respondents at high performers are nearly twice as likely as others to report offering peer-to-peer learning and certification programs to nontechnical personnel.\n\nIncreasing diversity on AI teams is a work in progress\n\nWe also explored the level of diversity within organizations\u2019 AI-focused teams, and we see that there is significant room for improvement at most organizations. The average share of employees on these teams at respondents\u2019 organizations who identify as women is just 27 percent (Exhibit 3). The share is similar when looking at the average proportion of racial or ethnic minorities developing AI solutions: just 25 percent. What\u2019s more, 29 percent of respondents say their organizations have no minority employees working on their AI solutions.\n\nSome companies are working to improve the diversity of their AI talent, though there\u2019s more being done to improve gender diversity than ethnic diversity. Forty-six percent of respondents say their organizations have active programs to increase gender diversity within the teams that are developing AI solutions, through steps such as partnering with diversity-focused professional associations to recruit candidates. One-third say their organizations have programs to increase racial and ethnic diversity. We also see that organizations with women or minorities working on AI solutions often have programs in place to address these employees\u2019 experiences.\n\nIn line with previous McKinsey studies, the research shows a correlation between diversity and outperformance. Organizations at which respondents say at least 25 percent of AI development employees identify as women are 3.2 times more likely than others to be AI high performers. Those at which at least one-quarter of AI development employees are racial or ethnic minorities are more than twice as likely to be AI high performers.\n\nAbout the research\n\nThe online survey was in the field from May 3 to May 27, 2022, and from August 15 to August 17, 2022, and garnered responses from 1,492 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 744 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one function and were asked questions about their organizations\u2019 AI use. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondent\u2019s nation to global GDP.",

        "text": "About a fifth of all workers have high-exposure jobs; women, Asian, college-educated and higher-paid workers are more exposed. But those in the most exposed industries are more likely to say AI will help more than hurt them personally\n\nA radiologist at Unfallkrankenhaus Berlin uses an AI-based app to look at a patient\u2019s brain scan images on a tablet. (Monika Skolimowska/picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how American workers may be exposed to artificial intelligence (AI) at their jobs. The study emphasizes the impact of AI on different groups of workers, such as men and women and racial and ethnic groups, and it includes new survey findings on how American adults think AI will impact them personally, setting it apart from preceding analyses. By exposure to AI, we refer to the likelihood that the activities workers perform on their jobs may be replaced or aided by artificial intelligence. We make no determination as to whether workers may lose their jobs as a result or gain new jobs, and we also do not consider the role of robots. Most of the analysis is based on data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), Version 27.3. O*NET analysts rate the importance of 41 work activities related to job performance in individual occupations. We grouped these activities into three categories based on their likely exposure to AI: low exposure, medium exposure and high exposure. Occupations were ranked by the relative importance of low- or high-exposure activities. Those in the top quarter of each ranking are the least or most exposed occupations. The remaining occupations have medium exposure. Data on the employment and earnings of workers in individual occupations and their demographic profiles are from the Current Population Survey (IPUMS). Monthly files from January to December 2022 were combined to form an annual file. Earnings data is available for a quarter of this sample. The AI-exposure rankings of 873 detailed occupations from the O*NET data are matched to 485 broader occupations listed in the CPS. A part of the analysis is based on a Pew Research Center survey of 11,004 U.S. adults conducted from Dec. 12 to 18, 2022. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.\n\nTerminology Artificial intelligence (AI): Broadly speaking, AI refers to a range of applications of machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing that allow computers or machines to perform tasks autonomously. AI can substitute for or complement a variety of human tasks, such as writing, drawing, providing customer service, reading radiology scans, driving cars and more. ChatGPT and Dall-E are examples of AI-driven technologies. Low or high exposure to AI: We rated a set of 41 job-related work activities common to all occupations as having low, medium or high exposure to AI. How much an occupation is exposed to AI depends on which of these work activities is more important in that particular job. The importance scale runs from one (not important) to five (extremely important). In this report, we focus on the importance of low- and high-exposure activities. In one step of analysis, occupations are ranked by the relative importance of high-exposure activities in them; the jobs ranking in the top 25% are occupations that we rate as most exposed to AI. In another step, occupations are ranked by the relative importance of low-exposure activities in them. Those ranking in the top 25% are occupations that are least exposed to AI. A full description of the ranking process is in the methodology. The terms occupation and job are often used interchangeably in the report, as are the terms earnings and wages. White, Black, Asian and American Indian or Pacific Islander workers include those who report being only one race and are not Hispanic. Hispanics are of any race. High school graduate refers to those who have a high school diploma or its equivalent, such as a General Education Development (GED) certificate, and those who had completed 12th grade, but their diploma status was unclear (those who had finished 12th grade but not received a diploma are excluded). Adults with some college include those with an associate degree and those who attended college but did not obtain a degree. U.S. born refers to individuals who are U.S. citizens at birth, including people born in the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories, as well as those born elsewhere to at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen. The terms foreign born and immigrant are used interchangeably in this report. They refer to people who are not U.S. citizens at birth.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) recently gained new attention with the release of ChatGPT and Dall-E. These tools and the broader array of AI-driven business applications represent a new reality for workers.\n\nHistorically, changes in technology have often automated physical tasks, such as those performed on factory floors. But AI performs more like human brainpower and, as its reach grows, that has raised questions about its impact on professional and other office jobs \u2013 questions that Pew Research Center seeks to address in a new analysis of government data.\n\nWhat we found\n\nIn 2022, 19% of American workers were in jobs that are the most exposed to AI , in which the most important activities may be either replaced or assisted by AI.\n\n, in which the most important activities may be either replaced or assisted by AI. 23% of workers have jobs that are the least exposed to AI , in which the most important activities are farther from the reach of AI. Other workers, nearly six-in-ten in all, are likely to have varying levels of exposure to AI.\n\n, in which the most important activities are farther from the reach of AI. Other workers, nearly six-in-ten in all, are likely to have varying levels of exposure to AI. Jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus.\n\nCertain groups of workers have higher levels of exposure to AI\n\nThose with more education: Workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or more (27%) are more than twice as likely as those with a high school diploma only (12%) to see the most exposure.\n\nWorkers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or more (27%) are more than twice as likely as those with a high school diploma only (12%) to see the most exposure. Women: A greater share of women (21%) than men (17%) are likely to see the most exposure to AI. This is because of differences in the types of jobs held by men and women.\n\nA greater share of women (21%) than men (17%) are likely to see the most exposure to AI. This is because of differences in the types of jobs held by men and women. Asian and White: Asian (24%) and White (20%) workers are more exposed than Black (15%) and Hispanic (13%) workers.\n\nAsian (24%) and White (20%) workers are more exposed than Black (15%) and Hispanic (13%) workers. Higher-wage workers: In 2022, workers in the most exposed jobs earned $33 per hour, on average, compared with $20 in jobs with the least amount of exposure.\n\nWorkers seem more hopeful than concerned about the impact of AI on their jobs\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey finds that many U.S. workers in more exposed industries do not feel their jobs are at risk \u2013 they are more likely to say AI will help more than hurt them personally. For instance, 32% of workers in information and technology say AI will help more than hurt them personally, compared with 11% who say it will hurt more than it helps.\n\nWhich jobs are more exposed to AI? Work-related tasks vary in their exposure to AI. Some activities, such as repairing equipment, may have low exposure to AI, while others may have a medium or a high degree of exposure. Also, activities with different levels of exposure may be equally important within many jobs.\n\nIn our analysis, jobs are considered more exposed to artificial intelligence if AI can either perform their most important activities entirely or help with them.\n\nFor example, AI could replace, at least to a degree, the tasks \u201cgetting information\u201d and \u201canalyzing data or information,\u201d or it could help with \u201cworking with computers.\u201d These are also among the key tasks for judicial law clerks and web developers, and they are more exposed to AI than other workers. However, AI alone cannot \u201cassist and care for others\u201d or \u201cperform general physical activities.\u201d Thus, nannies \u2013 for whom these are essential activities \u2013 are less exposed to AI.\n\nIn our analysis, jobs that placed in the top 25% when ranked by the importance of work activities with high exposure to AI were judged to be the most exposed. Jobs that placed in the top 25% when ranked by the importance of work activities with low exposure to AI are the least exposed. The remaining jobs, such as chief executives, are likely to see a medium level of exposure to AI. (Refer to the appendix for an extended list of examples of occupations in each group.)\n\nRelated: How we determined the degree to which jobs are exposed to artificial intelligence\n\nWill exposure to AI lead to job losses? The answer to this is unclear. Because AI could be used either to replace or complement what workers do, it is not known exactly which or how many jobs are in peril. For this reason, our study focuses on the level of exposure jobs have to AI. It sets aside the question of whether this exposure will lead to jobs lost or jobs gained.\n\nConsider customer service agents. Evidence shows that AI could either replace them with more powerful chatbots or it could enhance their productivity. AI may also create new types of jobs for more skilled workers \u2013 much as the internet age generated new classes of jobs such as web developers. Another way AI-related developments might increase employment levels is by giving a boost to the economy by elevating productivity and creating more jobs overall.\n\nOverall, AI is designed to mimic cognitive functions, and it is likely that higher-paying, white-collar jobs will see a fair amount of exposure to the technology. But our analysis doesn\u2019t consider the role of AI-enabled machines or robots that may perform mechanical or physical tasks. Recent evidence suggests that industrial robots may reduce both employment and wages. Moreover, jobs held by low-wage workers, those without a high school diploma, and younger men are more exposed to the effects of industrial robots.\n\nWhat data did we use? This analysis rests on data on the importance of 41 essential work activities in 873 occupations from the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Information Network (O*NET, Version 27.3). We used our judgment to determine which of these activities have low, medium or high exposure to AI, but focus on the importance of low- and high-exposure activities. For additional analysis, the 873 occupations were further grouped to a total of 485 for which government data on employment and earnings of workers were available. That allowed us to analyze the potential impact of AI on different groups of workers. Other findings about how workers feel about AI come from a Center survey of 11,004 U.S. adults conducted between Dec. 12 and 18, 2022. (Refer to the text boxes and methodology for more details.)\n\nOur other key findings\n\nMost workers are more likely to work in jobs with less exposure to AI than in jobs with more exposure. This is true among men, Black and Hispanic workers, younger workers, and workers with less formal education, among others.\n\nThis is true among men, Black and Hispanic workers, younger workers, and workers with less formal education, among others. Asian workers and college graduates are among the highest paid of workers most exposed to AI. The most exposed workers earn more than the least exposed workers no matter their demographic characteristic, and the gap is especially striking among men, Asian workers and foreign-born workers.\n\nThe most exposed workers earn more than the least exposed workers no matter their demographic characteristic, and the gap is especially striking among men, Asian workers and foreign-born workers. Analytical skills are more important in jobs with more exposure to AI. These skills include critical thinking, writing, science and mathematics. Mechanical skills, such as equipment maintenance, are more important in jobs with less exposure to AI.\n\nThese skills include critical thinking, writing, science and mathematics. Mechanical skills, such as equipment maintenance, are more important in jobs with less exposure to AI. Scarcely any U.S. businesses \u2013 fewer than 3% \u2013 reported using advanced technologies such as machine learning or machine vision software to produce goods or services in 2020, according to the most recent available data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Still, these were large businesses who accounted for about 11% to 16% of overall employment.\n\nSidebar: How we determined the degree to which jobs are exposed to artificial intelligence\n\nIn our analysis, we considered two major questions when assessing the exposure of jobs to AI:\n\nWhat is the likelihood that a work activity may be substituted for or complemented by AI at this time? Is the likelihood high, medium or low? How important are activities with high or low exposure to AI in any given job, relative to the importance of other activities?\n\nClassifying work activities by exposure to AI\n\nThe O*NET database lists a set of 41 work activities in common across all occupations. Examples of these activities are getting information, selling or influencing others, and handling and moving objects (refer to the methodology for the complete list). We used our collective judgment to designate each activity as having high, medium or low exposure to AI. Consensus on some activities, such as performing general physical activities or processing information, was reached quickly. The former is judged as having low exposure to AI and the latter is judged as having high exposure.\n\nIn other instances, we used additional details on a work activity to reach consensus. The question we asked ourselves at this stage was the following:\n\nAre most of the detailed tasks that comprise a work activity exposed to AI?\n\nFor example, the job activity \u201cperforming for or working directly with the public\u201d is ambiguous on the surface. But consider the list of detailed tasks that comprise this broad activity:\n\nAudition for roles\n\nPerform for recordings\n\nPerform music for the public\n\nCollaborate with others to prepare or perform artistic productions\n\nEntertain public with comedic or dramatic performances\n\nPerform dances\n\nOperate gaming equipment\n\nConduct amusement or gaming activities\n\nRespond to customer problems or complaints\n\nRespond to customer inquiries\n\nAnswer customer questions about goods or services\n\nCommunicate with customers to resolve complaints or ensure satisfaction\n\nResolve customer complaints or problems\n\nCorrespond with customers to answer questions or resolve complaints\n\nThe consensus we reached was that most of these detailed tasks, such as interfacing with customers or creating music, had a high degree of exposure to AI. Only a few tasks \u2013 auditioning, comedic or dramatic performances and dancing \u2013 were considered to have relatively low exposure to AI. For that reason, the broad activity \u201cperforming for or working directly with the public\u201d is deemed to have high exposure to AI.\n\nAt the other end of the exposure scale is the work activity \u201ccoaching and developing others,\u201d entailing:\n\nCoach others\n\nEncourage patients during therapeutic activities\n\nVisit individuals in their homes to provide support or information\n\nEncourage students\n\nInteract with patients to build rapport or provide emotional support\n\nSupport the professional development of others\n\nEncourage patients or clients to develop life skills\n\nThe focus of most of these detailed tasks involves personal interaction. So, we judged that the activity \u201ccoaching and developing others\u201d has low exposure to AI.\n\nOverall, 16 work activities were assessed to have high exposure to AI, 16 more were judged to have medium exposure, and nine were deemed to have low exposure. (Refer to the methodology for where each activity was classified.)\n\nDetermining the level of exposure of a job to AI\n\nThe 41 work activities listed in O*NET are spread across all occupations in the O*NET database. That is to say, each occupation is a mix of low, medium and high AI-exposure activities. The question then is:\n\nWhich work activities are relatively more important in a job? Are high- or low-exposure activities more important than other activities?\n\nTo answer this, we first estimated the averages of the importance ratings for high-, medium- and low-exposure activities in each job, where the rating of each activity within a category is taken from the O*NET database. The rating for each activity ranges from one (not important) to five (extremely important).\n\nOverall, among the 873 occupations we looked at, high-exposure activities were rated as being important to extremely important in 77% of occupations, and medium-exposure activities were similarly important in 72% of occupations. Low-exposure activities were rated as important in 39% of occupations. This suggests that high, medium and low exposure could simultaneously be important in a job.\n\nThe final step was to estimate the relative importance of high-, medium- or low-exposure activities in each job \u2013 that is, to determine which tasks are more important than the others in any given job. This procedure is described in the methodology. Occupations were then ranked two ways, once by the relative importance of high-exposure work activities and again by the relative importance of low-exposure work activities.\n\nIn our analysis, jobs that are most exposed to AI are in the top 25% of occupations ranked by the relative importance of high-exposure activities. Jobs that are least exposed to AI are in the top 25% of occupations ranked by the relative importance of low-exposure work activities. The other jobs may be thought of as having a medium level of exposure to AI. (Refer to the appendix for examples of occupations that are among the most or least exposed or have a medium level of exposure.)\n\nTo take an example, consider mechanical drafters, who prepare detailed working diagrams of machinery and mechanical devices. Mechanical drafters are among the workers most exposed to AI. For them, high-exposure activities have an average rating of 3.28 but low-exposure activities have an average rating of 2.36, where a rating of 3 means an activity is important.\n\nFor nannies, among the least exposed workers, high-exposure activities have an average rating of 2.36 but low-exposure activities have a rating of 3.03.\n\nPrevious research on the impact of AI on U.S. workers\n\nOur analysis follows in the footsteps of other researchers who have recently examined the impact of AI on the workplace. Eloundou, Manning, Mishkin and Rock (March 2023) conclude that about one-in-five U.S. workers may see an impact on half or more of their job tasks. Felten, Raj and Seamans (April 2021) find that white-collar occupations requiring advanced degrees are most exposed to AI, as are industries providing financial or legal services. Webb (January 2020) reports that high-skill occupations, highly educated and older workers will be more impacted by AI, but he does not draw conclusions about the nature or the extent of the impact on workers. Our findings are broadly consistent with the results of these analyses.\n\nCORRECTION (Oct. 26, 2023): In the appendix, a previous version of the bar chart \u201cShares of workers in an industry who are most likely see low exposure to AI\u201d included one mislabeled category. \u201cRetail trade\u201d should have been included, at 20%, and the actual share for \u201cManagerial and administrative services\u201d was 45%.",

        "text": "All the hype around generative artificial intelligence since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT has companies scrambling to hire talent who knows how to implement and harness the rapidly developing technology.\n\nIndeed's latest U.S. Jobs and Hiring Trends Report published in November found AI job postings surged 20-fold from the beginning of 2023 to the end of October.\n\nAs part of the trend, there has now been a sharp rise in what appears to be a hot new job for 2024: Chief AI Officer (CAIO).\n\nAccording to Glassdoor, 122 people with the title of chief or vice president of AI joined a forum last year on Glassdoor, up from 19 in 2022. That number is set to explode this year just from government positions alone, as over 400 federal departments are looking for CAIOs.\n\nAWS LAUNCHES PROGRAM TO BOOST AI AND TECH COMPETENCY FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES\n\nHowever, what does this new role entail, and who should fill it? Should an AI chief be an engineer, an attorney, or have some other background?\n\nAsha Palmer, SVP of Compliance at edtech firm Skillsoft, says the answers to those questions will vary depending on the industry and company, but leaders need to have concrete answers to them before investing in a dedicated AI position in the C-suite.\n\n\"I don't think there's one answer for everyone,\" Palmer told FOX Business. \"I think companies have to [ask], \u2018What are our use cases? And then, \u2019How are we using it? Where do we want to use it? How can we accelerate our business?' Those are all the questions businesses should start asking themselves, and probably already are.\"\n\nThen, Palmer says, companies need to ask themselves what risks they face by using AI, and determine who is best situated either internally or outside the organization to balance the opportunities and risks that come with the technology.\n\nOPENAI VALUED AT $80B AFTER DEAL: REPORT\n\nRather than having a dedicated chief AI officer, Skillsoft has an AI governance committee made up of a cross-functional team for oversight. Representatives from several different departments are involved, including representation from legal, engineering, compliance and customer success.\n\nPalmer says that whether a company chooses to hire a CAIO or to form a governing board, AI has to be an organizational focus with high-level oversight and visibility.\n\nShe said boards need to question their company's uses for AI and the controls around it, because the technology is here to stay and will be increasingly utilized, accelerating efficiencies and effectiveness. Additionally, those who are not asking those questions should start now in order to be ahead of the regulations surrounding AI that are sure to come.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nPalmer said regulations usually come after most people have put some kind of infrastructure in place, and serve as a force mechanism to make everyone else get on board.\n\nShe said, \"I would encourage businesses who are wanting to be good corporate citizens to start this journey in the absence of regulation, and really create a sustainable and strategic strategy around AI, which again, involves the acceleration factor, but also the guardrails and the brakes.\"",

        "text": "At a glance\n\nDuring the pandemic (2019\u201322), the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational shifts, 50 percent more than in the previous three-year period. Most involved people leaving food services, in-person sales, and office support for different occupations.\n\nMost involved people leaving food services, in-person sales, and office support for different occupations.

Federal investment to address climate and infrastructure, as well as structural shifts, will also alter labor demand. The net-zero transition will shift employment away from oil, gas, and automotive manufacturing and into green industries for a modest net gain in employment. Infrastructure projects will increase demand in construction, which is already short almost 400,000 workers today.

An additional 12 million occupational transitions may be needed by 2030. As people leave shrinking occupations, the economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs. Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in highest-wage positions, and most will need additional skills to do so successfully. Women are 1.5 times more likely to need to move into new occupations than men.\n\nAs people leave shrinking occupations, the economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs. Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in highest-wage positions, and most will need additional skills to do so successfully. Women are 1.5 times more likely to need to move into new occupations than men. The United States will need workforce development on a far larger scale as well as more expansive hiring approaches from employers. Employers will need to hire for skills and competencies rather than credentials, recruit from overlooked populations (such as rural workers and people with disabilities), and deliver training that keeps pace with their evolving needs.\n\nThe US labor market is going through a rapid evolution in the way people work and the work people do. Months after MGI released its last report on the future of work in America, the world found itself battling a global pandemic. Since then, the US job market has come roaring back from its sudden drop. The nature of work has changed as many workers have stuck with remote or hybrid models and employers have sped up their adoption of automation technologies. More recently, the accelerated development of generative AI, with its advanced natural language capabilities, has extended the possibilities for automation to a much wider set of occupations.\n\nAmid this disruption, workers changed jobs at a remarkable pace\u2014and a subset made bigger leaps and moved into entirely different occupations (Exhibit 1). Some 8.6 million occupational shifts took place from 2019 through 2022. Now even more change is in store. We expect an additional 12 million occupational shifts by 2030. The total number of transitions through 2030 could be 25 percent higher than we projected a little over two years ago.\n\nMultiple forces are set to fuel growth in certain occupations and erode jobs in others. They generally fall into three categories: automation, including generative AI; an injection of federal investment into infrastructure and the net-zero transition; and long-term structural trends such as aging, continuing investment in technology, and the growth of e-commerce and remote work. We do not forecast how aggregated employment may be affected by the business cycle in the short term; instead, we focus on how these forces may reshape the composition of labor demand over the long term.\n\nAcross a majority of occupations (employing 75 percent of the workforce), the pandemic accelerated trends that could persist through the end of the decade. Occupations that took a hit during the downturn are likely to continue shrinking over time. These include customer-facing roles affected by the shift to e-commerce and office support roles that could be eliminated either by automation or by fewer people coming into physical offices. Declines in food services, customer service and sales, office support, and production work could account for almost ten million (more than 84 percent) of the 12 million occupational shifts expected by 2030.\n\nBy contrast, occupations in business and legal professions, management, healthcare, transportation, and STEM were resilient during the pandemic and are poised for continued growth. These categories are expected to see fewer than one million occupational shifts by 2030.\n\nWorkers have shown a willingness to change career paths, while a tighter labor market has encouraged companies to hire from broader applicant pools.\n\nFor the other categories that account for the remaining one million occupational shifts still to come, the pandemic was a temporary headwind. Employment in fields like education and training should rise in the years ahead amid a continuous need for early education and lifelong learning. Demand for construction workers also stalled during the height of the pandemic but is expected to rebound strongly.\n\nThe changes estimated in our earlier research are happening even faster and on an even bigger scale than expected. It is becoming even more urgent to solve occupational and geographic mismatches and connect workers with the training they need to land jobs with better prospects. The fact that workers have been willing to pivot and change career paths, while a tighter labor market encouraged companies to hire from broader applicant pools, gives cause for optimism\u2014but not complacency. The future of work is already here, and it\u2019s moving fast.\n\nIn a tighter labor market, workers have been moving into new roles, accelerating occupational shifts\n\nBy the end of 2022, employment had bounced back to its 2019 level. But a great deal was in flux.\n\nAre pandemic-era labor shortages here to stay?\n\nThe quits rate soared to new heights during the pandemic, with roughly 48 million Americans leaving their jobs in 2021 and 51 million in 2022. What people did next is not fully evident from the data. Some moved into better jobs with higher pay. Others left the labor force, whether out of discouragement or for personal or health reasons, and it is unclear if or when they will return.\n\nTotal employment hit an all-time high after the pandemic, with many employers encountering hiring difficulties. As of April 2023, some ten million positions remained vacant; labor force participation had ticked up but was 0.7 percentage point below its prepandemic level. That translates into roughly 1.9 million workers who are neither employed nor actively looking for jobs. This erosion comes after an extended 20-year trend of steadily falling participation.\n\nLabor supply may continue to be constrained, given that one in four Americans will be of retirement age or older by 2030. Without higher participation rates, increased immigration, or meaningful productivity growth, labor shortages could be a lasting issue as the economy and the population grow. This remains an open question confronting markets, economists, and employers.\n\nThe Great Attrition obscured deeper shifts\n\nWhile most attention was focused on soaring quits rates during the pandemic, something more structural was also occurring. A subset of people did more than change employers; they moved into different occupations altogether. Based on net increases and decreases in employment, some 8.6 million occupational shifts took place from 2019 through 2022\u201450 percent more than in the previous three-year period (Exhibit 2). While it is impossible to trace individual moves, many people left their previous roles and landed better-paying jobs in other occupations.\n\nThe majority of these shifts came from people leaving jobs in food services, customer service and sales, office support, and production work (such as manufacturing). At the same time, managerial and professional roles plus transportation services collectively added close to four million jobs from 2019 to 2022. Our previous research had anticipated these types of changes over a longer time frame, but the pandemic suddenly accelerated matters. The past few years have been a preview of trends we expect to continue through the end of the decade.\n\nMore high-wage jobs\u2014and fewer workers taking lower-wage service jobs\n\nOverall employment in low- and middle-wage occupations has fallen from prepandemic levels, while occupations that pay more than $57,000 annually added about 3.5 million jobs. However, it is unclear how many higher-paying roles were filled by people who moved up and how many were filled by new entrants to the labor force. Meanwhile, the number of lower-wage job openings has not declined. Demand for lower-wage service work remains, but fewer workers are accepting these roles.\n\nWhat is clear from the job switching and occupational shifts of the past three years is that the US labor market accommodated a higher level of dynamic movement. Spiking demand and labor scarcity forced many employers to consider nontraditional candidates with potential and train them if they lacked direct experience. While this may not hold in the future, employers and workers alike can draw on what they have learned about the potential for people to make quick pivots and add new skills.\n\nAutomation and other forces will continue to reshape the labor market\n\nAutomation, from industrial robots to automated document processing systems, continues to be the biggest factor in changing the demand for various occupations. Generative AI is both accelerating automation and extending it to an entirely new set of occupations. While this technology is advancing rapidly, other forces are also affecting labor demand. Overall, we expect significant shifts in the occupational mix in the United States through the end of the decade.\n\nThe effects of automation and generative AI\n\nAutomation has taken a leap forward with the recent introduction of generative AI tools. \u201cGenerative\u201d refers to the fact that these tools can identify patterns across enormous sets of data and generate new content\u2014an ability that has often been considered uniquely human. Their most striking advance is in natural language capabilities, which are required for a large number of work activities. While ChatGPT is focused on text, other AI systems from major platforms can generate images, video, and audio.\n\nAlthough generative AI is still in the early stages, the potential applications for businesses are significant and wide-ranging. Generative AI can be used to write code, design products, create marketing content and strategies, streamline operations, analyze legal documents, provide customer service via chatbots, and even accelerate scientific discovery. It can be used on its own or with \u201chumans in the loop\u201d; the latter is more likely at present, given its current level of maturity.\n\nAll of this means that automation is about to affect a wider set of work activities involving expertise, interaction with people, and creativity. The timeline for automation adoption could be sharply accelerated. Without generative AI, our research estimated, automation could take over tasks accounting for 21.5 percent of the hours worked in the US economy by 2030. With it, that share has now jumped to 29.5 percent (Exhibit 3).\n\nImage description: A dot plot with 17 rows for different U.S. sectors shows automation adoption by 2030 as a share of time spent on work activities, averaging about 25% overall. Each row plots one circle for automation adoption without generative A.I. acceleration and one circle with acceleration and highlights the difference between. Sectors with the greatest jump in acceleration, 14 to 16 points, include stem professionals, education and workforce training, creatives and arts management, and business and legal professionals. End of image description.\n\nOther forces affecting future labor demand\n\nAutomation is not occurring in a vacuum, of course. Other trends are affecting the demand for certain occupations, and we expect the employment mix to change significantly through 2030, with more healthcare, STEM, and managerial positions and fewer jobs in customer service, office support, and food services.\n\nFederal investment: Recent federal legislation is driving momentum and investment in other areas that will affect jobs. Reaching the net-zero emissions goal is one of these priorities. Some 3.5 million jobs could be displaced through direct and indirect effects across the economy. But at the macro level, these losses should be more than offset by gains of 4.2 million jobs, primarily led by capital expenditures on renewable energy. The net-zero transition will likely be a net positive for jobs, but those jobs may be located in different places and require different skills. Similarly, major investment in infrastructure projects across the country will bolster construction jobs, which could see employment growth of 12 percent from 2022 through 2030. However, the sector already had some 383,000 unfilled positions in April 2023. This shortage will have to be addressed to bring infrastructure projects to life from coast to coast. The CHIPS and Science Act is putting additional funding into semiconductor manufacturing as well as R&D and scientific research. This comes at a time when some companies have been adjusting their supply chains, leading to an uptick in domestic manufacturing. While manufacturing is likely to boost employment demand overall in the years ahead, the sector is becoming more high-tech. It will involve fewer traditional production jobs than in the past but more workers with technical and STEM skills.\n\nOther structural trends: At the same time, other trends like rising incomes and education levels will sustain jobs. An aging population will need more healthcare workers in multiple roles, while the ongoing process of digitizing the economy will require adding more tech workers in every sector.\n\nPutting it all together, the mix of jobs is changing, and we anticipate an additional 12 million occupational shifts\n\nOne of the biggest questions of recent months is whether generative AI might wipe out jobs. Our research does not lead us to that conclusion, although we cannot definitively rule out job losses, at least in the short term. Technological advances often cause disruption, but historically, they eventually fuel economic and employment growth.\n\nThis research does not predict aggregated future employment levels; instead, we model various drivers of labor demand to look at how the mix of jobs might change\u2014and those results yield some gains and some losses. In fact, the occupational categories most exposed to generative AI could continue to add jobs through 2030 (Exhibit 4), although its adoption may slow their rate of growth. And even as automation takes hold, investment and structural drivers will support employment. The biggest impact for knowledge workers that we can state with certainty is that generative AI is likely to significantly change their mix of work activities.\n\nImage description: A scatterplot with a circle for each of the 17 U.S. sectors shows the relationship between the change in labor demand over 2022 to 2030 and the increase in automation adoption driven by generative AI acceleration. In the top right quadrant are circles for stem professionals, creatives and arts management, business and legal professionals, education and workforce training, indicating that those sectors have both increasing labor demand and high change of work activities. End of image description.\n\nResilient and growing occupational categories\n\nThe largest future job gains are expected to be in healthcare, an industry that already has an imbalance, with 1.9 million unfilled openings as of April 2023. We estimate that there could be demand for 3.5 million more jobs for health aides, health technicians, and wellness workers, plus an additional two million healthcare professionals.\n\nBy 2030, we further estimate a 23 percent increase in the demand for STEM jobs. Although layoffs in the tech sector have been making headlines in 2023, this does not change the longer-term demand for tech talent among companies of all sizes and sectors as the economy continues to digitize. Employers in banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare, for example, are undertaking major digital transformations and need tech workers with advanced skills. In addition, the transportation services category is expected to see job growth of 9 percent by 2030.\n\nDeclining occupational categories\n\nThe biggest future job losses are likely to occur in office support, customer service, and food services. We estimate that demand for clerks could decrease by 1.6 million jobs, in addition to losses of 830,000 for retail salespersons, 710,000 for administrative assistants, and 630,000 for cashiers. These jobs involve a high share of repetitive tasks, data collection, and elementary data processing, all activities that automated systems can handle efficiently. Our analysis also finds a modest decline in production jobs despite an upswing in the overall US manufacturing sector, which is explained by the fact that the sector increasingly requires fewer traditional production jobs but more skilled technical and digital roles.\n\nWe estimate that 11.8 million workers currently in occupations with shrinking demand may need to move into different lines of work by 2030. Roughly nine million of them may wind up moving into different occupational categories altogether. Considering what has already transpired, that would bring the total number of occupational transitions through the decade\u2019s end to a level almost 25 percent higher than our earlier estimates, creating a more pronounced shift in the mix of jobs across the economy.\n\nOverall, we expect more growth in demand for jobs requiring higher levels of education and skills, plus declines in roles that typically do not require college degrees (Exhibit 5).\n\nImage description: A bar chart with a row for each of the 17 U.S. sectors plots estimated future job growth over 2022 to 2030. Rising the most, from 23% to 30% are health professionals; health aides, technicians, and wellness; and stem professionals. Decreasing from 1% to 18% are office support, customer service and sales, food services, and production work. End of image description.\n\nWorkers in jobs with lower wages and educational requirements could be the most affected\n\nPeople in the two lowest wage quintiles (those earning less than $30,800 a year and those earning $30,800 to $38,200 a year) are up to 10 and 14 times more likely, respectively, to need to change occupations by the end of this decade than the highest earners. Changing occupations, as opposed to finding a new job within the same occupation, often requires adding new skills and is more challenging.\n\nThe jobs in the two lowest wage quintiles are disproportionately held today by those with less education, women, and people of color. Women are heavily represented in office support and customer service, which could shrink by about 3.7 million and 2.0 million jobs, respectively, by 2030. Similarly, Black and Hispanic workers are highly concentrated in some shrinking occupations within customer service, food services, and production work.\n\nWhile our analysis shows a decrease of 1.1 million jobs in the two lowest wage quintiles by 2030, jobs in the highest wage quintile could grow sharply, by 3.8 million. Helping workers in lower-wage, shrinking occupations move into better-paying jobs with more stability will require widespread access to training programs, effective job matching, different hiring and training practices by employers, and better geographic mobility.\n\nThe overall labor market will have higher demand for social-emotional and digital skills. Although the demand for basic cognitive and manual skills is likely to decline, physical work is not going away. It may still account for just under 31 percent of time spent, driven by growth in sectors such as transportation services, construction, and healthcare.\n\nThis period of change can be an opportunity for more inclusive growth\n\nWith the pace of change unlikely to let up, the challenge will be helping workers match up with the jobs of the future. While some of this may require large-scale collaboration, individual companies can fill many of the gaps by adapting their own approaches to hiring and training.\n\nBoosting productivity through automation and generative AI\n\nRecent MGI research focused on how to reignite productivity growth in the United States. Automation and reskilling will be vital to this effort. Automation could jump-start lackluster productivity while simultaneously easing labor shortages.\n\nGenerative AI has the potential to increase US labor productivity by 0.5 to 0.9 percentage points annually through 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario. The range reflects whether the time freed up by automation is redeployed at 2022 productivity levels or 2030 levels, with both scenarios accounting for the occupational mix expected in 2030.\n\nCombining generative AI with all other automation technologies, the potential growth could be even larger. All types of automation could help drive US productivity growth to 3 to 4 percent annually in a midpoint adoption scenario. However, this will require significant action from stakeholders across the public and private sector. Workers will need support in learning new skills, and other risks associated with generative AI also need to be mitigated and controlled. But if worker transitions and risks are well managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth.\n\nTo capture the full benefits of generative AI to make knowledge work more productive, employers, policy makers, and broader ecosystems would need to establish clear guidelines and guardrails\u2014and workers would need to see these tools not as job destroyers but as work enhancers. When machines take over dull or unpleasant tasks, people can be left with more interesting work that requires creativity, problem-solving, and collaborating with others. Workers will need to gain proficiency with these tools and, importantly, use the time that is freed up to focus on higher-value activities. When managers automate more of their administrative and reporting tasks, for example, they can spend more time on strategic thinking and coaching. Similarly, researchers could speed up projects by relying on automation tools to sort and synthesize large data sets.\n\nFor employers, doubling down on innovative hiring strategies\n\nMost employers can benefit from using a broader lens in hiring. Instead of insisting on prior experience that matches the responsibilities of an open role as closely as possible, organizations can evaluate candidates on their capacity to learn, their intrinsic capabilities, and their transferable skills.\n\nHiring people with potential and training them on the job can be an answer to labor shortages\u2014and give opportunities to people who need them.\n\nA great deal of skills development happens on the job. Previous MGI research found that work experience contributes 40 percent of the average individual\u2019s lifetime earnings in the United States. Skills learned through work experience are an even bigger determinant for people without educational credentials who start out in lower-wage work.\n\nFilling the jobs of the future is an opportunity to make the labor market more inclusive. Employers may need to reconsider whether some credential requirements are really necessary. Some 60 percent of US workers have skills gained through experience but lack four-year college degrees. Initiatives like Tear the Paper Ceiling are supporting workers who have experience but not degrees by raising awareness among employers and providing resources.\n\nEmployers can also recruit from populations that are often overlooked, such as retirees who want to return to work, people with employment gaps, and the formerly incarcerated. Remote work, for example, is opening up long-needed opportunities for people with disabilities who cannot commute and those in rural communities.\n\nTackling other structural issues\n\nWomen left the workforce in relatively higher numbers than men during the pandemic. It took three full years for the number of working women in the United States to fully bounce back. Many women doing lower-wage work have family obligations that may leave them feeling that they can\u2019t take the risk of going back to school or trying a new occupation. Beyond the hiring practices that can encourage and enable women to make career transitions, the need for affordable childcare remains a major barrier. To address it, a number of private-sector employers are expanding childcare benefits, while some state and local governments are providing tax credits, subsidies, or direct funding. In addition, historically male-dominated fields such as construction that are facing labor shortages can fill those gaps with more women, improving diversity in the process.\n\nOne key area of job demand is in caregiving, which is critical social infrastructure. We anticipate that the two fastest-growing occupations through the end of this decade will be nurses and home healthcare aides. Childcare workers, as noted above, provide a vital service to working families. But people have been leaving these types of jobs in droves. Meeting these growing needs will likely hinge on upgrading the quality of what are today typically low-paying jobs with little security or advancement opportunities.\n\nWhile large employers may be able to handle their own training needs, the magnitude of the reskilling challenge for the nation as a whole calls for broader partnerships with industry groups, educational providers, and nonprofits as well as incentives for investing in human capital. Addressing the need for reskilling with efforts beyond individual companies would help spread the cost, addressing the concerns of employers who might be reluctant to invest in training for employees who can subsequently leave.\n\nWith millions of jobs potentially being eliminated by automation\u2014and even more being created in fields requiring different skills\u2014the United States needs broad access to effective training programs as well as job-matching assistance that can help individuals find opportunities. Many initiatives are in place, but it will be critical to dramatically scale up what works and take a proactive approach to filling key shortages. One promising solution, still in the early stages, involves digital learning and employment records\u2014a kind of digital microcredential that can document how an individual worker has acquired skills and also translate across companies and over time.\n\nThe US labor market has been remarkably resilient in the face of recent challenges and rapid changes. That kind of adaptability is exactly what it will take to navigate the next chapter as well, supporting individuals while helping businesses meet their talent needs so they can continue driving growth.",

        "text": "Progress in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has remade the human resources (HR) department, enabling HR professionals to leverage machine learning and algorithms to streamline their work processes, reduce their biases, and enhance their analysis and decision-making. However, current limitations and vulnerabilities have given some organizations pause when it comes to adopting AI for additional use cases. In this article, we\u2019ll discuss some of the ways AI is changing HR, considerations when adopting it and how far the trend may go.\n\nHow HR teams are embracing AI In Eightfold AI\u2019s report The Future of Work: Intelligent by Design, the majority of the 250 HR leaders surveyed said they are already using AI across HR functions like employee records management (78 percent), payroll processing and benefits administration (77 percent), recruitment and hiring (73 percent), performance management (72 percent), and onboarding new employees (69 percent). In terms of future use, 92 percent of HR leaders intend to increase their AI use in at least one area of HR. The top five areas are performance management (43 percent), payroll processing and benefits administration (42 percent), recruitment and hiring (41 percent), onboarding new employees (40 percent), and employee records management (39 percent). Most plan to increase their usage in the next 12 to 18 months. That aligns with other research that suggests AI\u2019s usage in HR is expected to grow in the coming years. IDC\u2019s Future of Work 2022 research predicted that this year, 60 percent of global 2000 businesses will deploy AI and machine learning (ML) tools to support the entire employee life cycle experience. By 2024, the authors predict, 80 percent of the global 2000 organizations will use AI/ML-enabled \u201cmanagers\u201d to hire, fire and train employees. In fact, there was news of Amazon using algorithms or bots to fire people two years ago. IDC\u2019s research director, Amy Loomis, said this practice is already widely used in HR today via stack ranking. Stack ranking is a statistical approach that compares employees\u2019 performance against each other. After analysis of staff performance, stack ranking software recommends that underperforming individuals take additional training, advise managers to do intervention or, worst case, lay off people who fall below the threshold of acceptable performance. It could be as big as terminating employees who fall into the bottom 10 percent of performers. To mitigate this trend, New York City passed a law that requires companies to audit their AI-powered recruitment software for biases. Companies violating this law face fines.\n\nHow HR teams are using AI AI tools are versatile and offer HR teams a number of applications, helping them complete many important functions in a faster, more thorough way than ever before. Here\u2019s a look at some of the ways HR teams are employing AI technology today. Recruiting and hiring Recruitment and talent acquisition are among the first HR tasks AI has been used to improve. From job posting to sending job offers, AI has significantly reduced the time spent recruiting new employees by automating manual tasks. Aleksander Dolgov, co-founder and chief people officer of Skipp, a talent-as-a-service platform for tech professionals, has witnessed the power of AI in sourcing technical talent by automating repetitive tasks and providing valuable insights into employee performance and candidate outreach: \u201cProfessionals who source IT developers, UI/UX designers and other technical roles often use tools such as LinkedIn and GitHub to find and engage with potential candidates,\u201d Dolgov said. \u201cWith the help of AI, these professionals can generate customized sequences of messages and communications for each candidate, helping to improve engagement and response rates. Additionally, AI can be used to track and analyze conversion rates, allowing recruiters and hiring managers to identify and refine their most successful outreach strategies.\u201d Committed to AI for good, programmatic job advertising platform PandoLogic has most recently been exploring the potential of ChatGPT and generative AI to drive recruitment chatbots forward. Keisuke Inoue, lead algorithm data scientist, shares that PandoLogic already uses AI in such a manner, specifically for interview question generation and question answering through a proprietary domain-specific large language model (DSLLM). \u201cPandoLogic\u2019s DSLLM is optimized for the recruitment domain, leveraging a large collection of job descriptions and relevant datasets,\u201d Inoue said. \u201cWith this domain-specific knowledge, the DSLLM is able to produce safer and more reliable job interview questions that are suitable for incoming job descriptions than generally available AI tools. Compared with traditional approaches, PandoLogic\u2019s generative AI is able to handle unforeseen questions through GPT4 and contextual data.\u201d Onboarding AI can develop and automate onboarding new hires: Verifying employee documents\n\nConducting induction training\n\nHandling administrative tasks like providing IDs and access to company hardware and software \u201cOnboarding is an essential part of HR, and AI can make the process smoother and more personalized. AI-powered chatbots can guide new employees through the onboarding process, answering questions and providing information and prompts,\u201d said Nick Gallimore, managing director of people management at Advanced, a business software company. \u201cThis ensures that at no part during the process will a candidate be \u2018left hanging\u2019 or \u2018ghosted,\u2019 which retains a positive image/reputation for the brand, which is vital in today\u2019s very competitive talent market,\u201d he added. \u201cThis frees up HR staff to focus on more complex tasks. AI can also help to personalize the onboarding process by analyzing data on each employee, such as their skills and preferences, and tailoring their training accordingly.\u201d Did You Know? Did you know Poor onboarding could result in unanticipated employee turnover. Companies spend approximately 20 percent of an employee\u2019s pay to hire a replacement, and the total cost of turnover when factoring in onboarding, training and lost productivity could be between 100 percent and 300 percent of an employee\u2019s salary. Employee monitoring The best employee monitoring software is now incorporating AI to identify bottlenecks in worker productivity by keeping tabs on their online movements. This can help administrators easily manage large workforces without manually monitoring activity, instead providing them with notifications and alerts when AI detects anomalies or violations of company policy. \u201cAI can monitor employees\u2019 performance, behavior and engagement, providing HR teams with valuable insights. It can analyze employee data, such as emails, chats and work patterns, to detect signs of burnout, disengagement or even misconduct,\u201d Gallimore said. \u201cThis valuable insight can help HR teams to address issues before they become more significant. AI-powered tools can also track employee productivity, providing data on how much time employees spend on specific tasks. This can help HR teams to optimize workflows and identify areas for improvement.\u201d Learning and development AI in learning and development can help create personalized training to suit each employee. Anjela Mangrum, founder of manufacturing recruitment agency Mangrum Career Solutions, sees significant possibilities of AI in maximizing employees\u2019 development. \u201cI \u2026 think there\u2019s a lot of potential for AI to customize employee training, creating data-based career paths for each individual instead of the traditional generic focus on helping employees gain in-demand business skills,\u201d Mangrum said. \u201cBy tracking the unique learning methods of professionals, AI can help develop your workforce by providing individualized recommendations for skills training.\u201d Internal mobility Promotion and career development of employees are made easier by using AI tools to source talent from within the organization. \u201cStreamlining your internal mobility processes can also be best done with AI,\u201d Mangrum said. \u201cMatchmaking employees and departments isn\u2019t always the easiest, so many employers tend to simply post a job ad instead of considering their current team members for vacant positions. AI can handle that task, saving you precious dollars in recruiting and training external talent.\u201d\n\nHow AI benefits HR departments While change can be daunting, AI tools offer several key benefits to HR departments, streamlining their workflows and supporting improved decision-making. These benefits include the following: Improved efficiency AI can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks so HR professionals can focus on creating strategies. Moreover, AI also improves decision-making with valuable insights via HR and predictive analytics. For example, AI can enhance hiring efficiency by streamlining the screening and selection process. Algorithms can analyze resumes, determine the most qualified candidates and provide information to help recruiters make better hiring decisions. Reduced costs AI-powered software can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends and suggest cost-effective solutions. For instance, AI gives information about your sources of hire that generate the highest quality of applicants so you can allocate your hiring budget accordingly or drop ineffective recruitment channels. McKinsey\u2019s Global AI Survey shows that 27 percent of HR respondents said their AI adoption resulted in a cost reduction of less than 10 percent, while 23 percent reported an average revenue increase of 6 percent to 10 percent. The HR areas involved in this survey were performance management and organization design, workforce deployment, and talent management optimization. Better decision-making AI enables the collection and analysis of data in your HR processes to eliminate biases and guesswork to guarantee you are choosing the right candidate or offering the best compensation and benefits plan. For example, mining recruitment data helps uncover challenges so you can address them objectively. Looking at your recruitment analytics, you can: Focus on cost-associated metrics like job advertising performance and cost per hire to reduce hiring expenses\n\nConcentrate on speed-related key performance indicators (KPIs), like time to fill and time to hire, to expedite recruiting\n\nPay attention to quality-related KPIs, like new-hire turnover and new-hire retention rate, to improve the quality of hires. Key Takeaway Key takeaway Adopting AI-powered tools can drastically improve efficiency, reduce costs and provide valuable information to your HR department.",

        "text": "Key Points:\n\nNext year\u2019s outlook will depend not only on the direction of demand for workers, but also on whether any future declines are coming primarily through less hiring, rather than more layoffs.\n\nMore prime-age workers may continue to join the labor force if the labor market remains tight and immigration flows stay high. But don\u2019t expect these forces to hold off the shrinking effects of an aging population forever.\n\nWorkers are quitting less frequently than a few years ago, but job-switching is still elevated by historical standards.\n\nWage growth increasingly looks like it\u2019s on track to return to a pre-pandemic pace. But it\u2019s unclear how long that return will take and whether inflation will follow a similar trajectory.\n\nIncreased usage of GenAI and other technologies \u2014 in addition to an increase in jobs developing those tools \u2014 could reshape the broader labor market. Watch for the use of Generative AI in jobs that don\u2019t create AI.\n\nThe labor market didn\u2019t follow the script many people wrote for it this year. Let\u2019s all be thankful for that. Despite many projections for a recession, a historically fast tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, a banking crisis, and geopolitical crises and uncertainty, the labor market stands strong. Getting to this spot required a few unexpected things to happen.\n\nJob openings and job postings fell considerably, but layoffs stayed low. Workers came flooding back into the labor force, and employers continued hiring at a solid clip, but wage growth slowed. The so-called \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d that marked the early post-pandemic years ended, but workers still felt comfortable leaving their jobs. A host of new artificial intelligence tools were introduced that threaten to upend how many workers do their jobs, but there\u2019s no immediate sign of it displacing workers.\n\nBut past performance is no guarantee of future results. Everything that needed to go right for the labor market in 2023 largely has. For next year to end on a similar high note, a few trends need to hold up or accelerate in 2024:\n\nDemand for workers will need to stay strong, either because job postings hold firm or employers hoard workers despite weak hiring plans.\n\nMore prime-age workers will need to enter the workforce to counteract the long-term drag of an aging population.\n\nQuitting will need to stick at its current pace, a level consistent with what we saw before the pandemic but still elevated by historical standards.\n\nNominal wage growth will need to continue to come down to ease concerns about the labor market fueling inflation. But for workers to keep adding to their purchasing power, wage growth cannot fall below the rate of inflation.\n\nGenerative AI tools may spread rapidly through the economy and boost productivity growth.\n\nThis report digs into these broad trends. Following them will help us navigate next year\u2019s path. Fingers crossed, the trail doesn\u2019t take any detours.\n\nDemand for workers has moderated, but further reductions could be more troubling.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cIndeed Job Postings Index\u201d with a vertical axis spanning from 40 to 160. The index is set so the daily number of job postings on February 1, 2020, is equal to 100. The index declined for much of 2022 and early 2023, but its descent has moderated in recent months.\n\nEmployers\u2019 hiring appetites are no longer as ravenous as a few years ago. As of early November, the Indeed Job Postings Index is down 22.5% from its December 31, 2021 peak, and the federal government\u2019s job openings number is down 20.6% from its March 2022 high as of September. Part of the decline in these measures is because employers have been able to fill many positions. As of October, total employment was 3% above its February 2020 pre-pandemic peak.\n\nA table with the title \u201cSectors with the sharpest declines in job postings\u201d shows the year-over-year change in the Job Postings Index for different occupational sectors. The largest decline is for Software Development job postings, down 51%.\n\nAt the same time, many employers have rethought their staffing plans in light of slowing economic growth, shifting consumer demand, and higher interest rates. The pullback in job postings has been most stark in sectors tied to previously high-flying industries, including tech, where stock valuations have fallen and hiring plans have returned to earth. Sectors connected to companies that provide in-person services, including restaurants, hotels, and hospitals, represent a continued source of robust hiring demand.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cPostings are most resilient in sectors most likely to be in person\u201d shows trends in the Indeed Job Postings Index by remote work tier. Sectors more likely to advertise remote work have seen job postings slip more since 2022.\n\nThe divergence in hiring outlooks can be seen in the different trends for jobs depending on whether they need staff to be in person. While job postings are down overall, postings in sectors with the highest shares of roles that can be done remotely have fallen the most \u2014 essentially back to pre-pandemic levels. Job postings for the sectors most likely to require in-person work have actually increased since mid-year, up 3.1% from June 16th to November 3rd, while overall postings were down 1% over the same period. The continued resilience of hiring in these sectors depends on continued strong consumer spending for in-person services which flows through to desired hiring.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cLayoffs remain low by historical standards\u201d shows the layoffs and discharges rate from January 2019 to September 2023. The vertical axis spans from 0.9% to 1.8%. The current layoff rate of 1% remains below the lowest layoff rate prior to the pandemic.\n\nAnd while employers may be less enthusiastic about adding more workers to their payrolls, they seem content to keep the workers they already have \u2014 falling demand for workers overall is coming primarily through less demand for new workers. After a brief rise early in the year, the overall layoff rate as of September was just 1%, a level that would have represented a record low before the pandemic. There has been a dramatic decline in layoffs over the course of the year in a handful of industries, including Retail Trade. In February 2020, just prior to the onset of the pandemic, the layoff rate for the Retail Trade sector was 1.9%. By September 2023, the latest available data, the layoff rate in Retail had essentially halved, to just 0.9%.\n\nNext year\u2019s outlook will depend not only on the direction of demand for workers \u2014 whether it continues to fall or not \u2014 but also on the means through which employers reduce that demand. If demand for new hires continues cooling at roughly the same gradual pace as it has throughout 2023, then the labor market can be expected to continue on its current path without a spike in unemployment. But while postings and openings remain elevated relative to historic norms, they are still at a much lower level than recent highs. A further, rapid descent from these lower levels could mean that fewer currently unemployed workers are getting hired, leading to a rise in unemployment.\n\nAnd a prolonged contraction in overall demand for workers could also mean that employers would start to shed current workers and layoffs would start to mount. Job postings and job openings could fall even more without a large rise in unemployment if employers hoard labor, as many have hypothesized. But that\u2019s uncharted territory for the US labor market. Keeping an eye on not just the growth of job postings and openings, but the level as well, will be important next year.\n\nThe labor force is growing, but it can\u2019t defy demographic gravity forever\n\nMost predictions about the future are difficult, but some are relatively easy. Without a tremendous surge in immigration in the next few years, the United States will continue to age. According to projections from the Congressional Budget Office, the share of the working-age population 65 and above will grow from 17.5% in 2023, to 20.9% in 2035. An aging population means the pool of available workers will shrink in the years to come.\n\nBut over the past year, the labor force has defied these dynamics and grown quite quickly. The US labor force grew by an average of 276,000 people per month through the first 10 months of the year \u2014 faster than both the 2021 monthly average of 98,000 workers and the average of 131,000 in the three years prior to the pandemic. If the long-term trend is toward a slower-growing labor force, how was 2023 such a strong year?\n\nA bar chart titled \u201cThe labor force is growing rapidly in 2023\u201d shows average monthly labor force growth during the first 10 months of the year. The chart shows data for 2023 (an average of 276,000 per month, 2022 (224,000 per month), and 2021 (98,000 per month.) It also shows a line for the average pace from 2017 through 2019: 131,000 per month.\n\nIn short, the participation rate of prime-age workers, those aged 25-to-54, rose to levels not seen since the early 2000s. As of October, the participation rate for these workers was 83.3%, down from a recent peak of 83.5% the month prior, but still comparable to rates twenty years ago. Consistently high demand for workers has both pulled more people into the labor force, and kept more current participants attached to the job market. A rebound in immigration from depressed pandemic-era flows has boosted prime-age participation as well. Even though foreign-born workers were just 18% of the labor force a year ago, roughly a fourth of the growth in the labor force over the past year has come from foreign-born workers. Short-term strength has managed to push back against the long-term trend. At least for now.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much longer these short-term boosts to the labor force can continue. While 25-54-year-olds are participating at a rate in the range of what we saw twenty years ago, the current prime-age labor force participation rate is still short of its all-time high of 84.6% reached in January 1999. Even if participation among prime-age workers rose to match that high, and more workers aged 65+ pushed their participation rates to all-time highs, the labor force participation rate would only slightly increase next year, and then stabilize in 2025. After that, the weight of demographics would take over, and the participation rate would start to drop.\n\nA bar chart titled \u201cAn aging population will eventually pull down the US labor force participation rate.\u201d The chart shows labor force participation rates for 2018 through 2023 and then projected labor force participation rates under a scenario laid out in the text of the report.\n\nOne way to counteract this seemingly inevitable slide could be through increased immigration, which may continue to be a meaningful source of workers in the next few years, but likely not a growing one. Foreign interest in job postings on Indeed has picked up since the pandemic and is well above 2019 levels. About 4% of clicks on job postings in the US came from outside the country in September 2023, up from roughly 2% four years prior. However, foreign interest seemingly plateaued over the past year. If interest from job seekers outside the US is any indication, immigration is unlikely to accelerate next year and provide a larger boost to the labor force.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cForeign job seeker interest has increased\u201d shows the share of clicks on US job postings from outside the US. The share has increased from 2018 and 2019 levels of roughly 2% and now stands at a bit more than 4%.\n\nReplicating the strong labor force growth of the past year will be difficult, but continued strong demand for workers, and robust immigration, may offer a temporary reprieve from the long-term trend. Because so many Americans have simply aged into retirement over the past few years, and with many more behind them in the years to come, overall labor supply will remain more limited than it was pre-pandemic \u2014 though it will still respond to a strong labor market. The currently resilient labor market might test the bounds of how much further participation rates can rise for some workers, but it can\u2019t defy the gravity of demographics forever.\n\nThe Great Resignation is behind us, but that doesn\u2019t mean workers aren\u2019t quitting their jobs\n\nAs we head toward the end of 2023, it\u2019s clear that workers just aren\u2019t quitting like they used to, at least compared to the rates in late 2021 and 2022. The immediate post-pandemic surge in workers voluntarily leaving their jobs was so sudden and remarkable it was deemed the \u201cGreat Resignation.\u201d Job opportunities were proliferating and competition for workers was fierce. While the data on quitting can\u2019t tell us where workers end up after they leave their jobs, other data from the federal government can. Those data show the Great Resignation was a period of elevated job switching.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cQuits rates and job-switching rates tend to move together\u201d covers data from the first quarter of 2001 to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThose days, at least as we knew them, are behind us. The quits rate stood at 2.3% in September, the latest available data, equal to the average rate in 2019. This slowdown in quitting is mainly attributable to declining employer demand for new hires in early 2022. But another feature of the Great Resignation period was that workers were leaving their jobs at high rates while the overall unemployment rate was still elevated following pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cQuitting is still strong by historical standards.\u201d The graph covers data from January 2001 to September 2023. The most recent data show the quits rate is equal to where it was in 2019 and that this level is strong by historical standards.\n\nGenerally, workers feel more comfortable quitting when unemployment is low and their confidence in finding another job is high \u2014 the typical relationship shows that when unemployment is high, quitting is low, and vice versa. And when unemployment is high, you\u2019d expect it to be unemployed workers filling open job roles rather than those currently holding a job. But during 2021, the quits rate rose much faster than one might expect given the unemployment rate. It looked as though more hires were coming from the ranks of the already-employed, rather than the unemployed.\n\nBut the relationship between quitting and the unemployment rate has since shifted back to its pre-pandemic pattern. The quits rate in September was roughly in line with what may have been predicted pre-pandemic if the unemployment rate was 3.8%, as it was in September. That reconnection can be seen in the graph below, in which the quits rate and the unemployment rates for January 2020 and September 2023 are very close to each other. The pandemic-era disconnect between the job-finding outlook for the employed and the unemployed has disappeared. The result is that quitting has declined without a corresponding rise in the unemployment rate.\n\nA graph titled \u201cThe relationship between quitting and unemployment is back to its pre-pandemic status\u201d shows data on the unemployment rate and the quits rate.\n\nHowever, a return to the 2019-era quits rate doesn\u2019t mean workers are suddenly without opportunities to find new jobs, or that employers don\u2019t need to worry about retaining current workers. Before the Great Resignation, the all-time high quits rate was 2.4% \u2014 just barely above the current level of 2.3% \u2014 a sign that workers are still job-switching at near-historic rates. And even if the overall quits rate falls further to levels more in line with historical averages, individual industries and sectors may see more churn, and more workers looking to leave. For example, quitting in Leisure and Hospitality remains above its pre-pandemic rate, while the quits rate for Professional and Business Services stands below its February 2020 level.\n\nA chart titled \u201cQuits rate by industry sector\u201d shows the quits rate for a variety of industry sectors in September 2023 and February 2020. Most sectors had a quits rate in September very similar to their pre-pandemic rate, with a few exceptions.\n\nJob seekers are increasingly shifting their interest to job postings outside their current field, according to Indeed data. For example, the share of civil engineers looking at job postings outside of their field has grown by almost 9 percentage points since 2019 \u2014 from almost 77% in 2019 to more than 85% currently. If a growing share of workers in some fields are looking to leave those roles without an offsetting rise in interest from other fields, employers would need to take steps to retain current employees. Such steps could include pay hikes, increases in benefits, or changes in workplace flexibility, among others.\n\nA table titled \u201cSectors with the largest jump in workers looking to leave their field since 2019.\u201d The table shows data on the rates at which job seekers are clicking on job postings in sectors which different from their current occupation.\n\nWage growth looks to be settling down \u2014 hopefully, inflation will follow\n\nOne of the most apparent signs of the ongoing US labor market cooldown is that wages are no longer growing as quickly as they recently were. Falling employer demand, increasing labor supply, and diminished quitting has resulted in employers handing out smaller raises. This slowdown in wage growth can be seen in a variety of measures of wage growth, including the Indeed Wage Tracker and those from the federal government. The Indeed Wage Tracker peaked first \u2014 in January 2022 \u2014 and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s Wage Growth Tracker peaked last, in early 2023.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cA quartet of wage growth metrics\u201d shows year-over-year wage growth for four measures of wage growth. All four measures show wage growth moderating in 2023.\n\nWhile wage growth has slowed by several measures, it hasn\u2019t yet returned to its pre-pandemic growth pace. But there are indications it may fall to that level relatively soon. According to the latest data from the Indeed Wage Tracker, posted wages in October were up 4.2% from a year prior, down from 4.8% in July, and well below the January 2022 peak of 9.3%. If posted wages continue to slow down at roughly the rate they have for the past three months, the Indeed Wage Tracker will return to its pre-pandemic pace before the middle of next year.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cUS posted wages are slowing considerably\u201d with a vertical axis from 0% to 10%. The graph covers from January 2019 to October 2023. It shows posted wage growth rising quickly through most of 2021 before peaking in January 2022 and declining through October 2023.\n\nWage growth seems on a track back to the healthy and sustainable rate seen before the pandemic. Wage growth between 3.5% to 4% would be consistent with 2% inflation, assuming labor productivity grows between 1.5% and 2% annually. Labor productivity is up 2.2% over the past year, but the underlying pace might be lower than that moving forward.\n\nNote that the data above is nominal and does not account for inflation. Consumer prices were up 3.2% year-over-year in October, above both pre-pandemic norms and the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. By most measures, wages are currently growing slightly faster than the rate of inflation, meaning workers\u2019 purchasing power is actually showing a modest increase. But if nominal wages continue to decelerate, inflation will also have to slow further for workers to keep receiving these inflation-adjusted raises.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cPosted wages are growing faster than prices\u201d covers data from January 2019 to October 2023. The graph compares year-over-year growth in the Consumer Price Index versus the Indeed Wage Tracker.\n\nThe inflation outlook is hotly debated. Whether and how quickly it returns to the desired 2% annual rate depends on many factors including the effects of monetary policy, changing consumer behaviors, the stability of inflation expectations, and, of course, the state of the labor market. If wage growth stays higher for longer it could impede inflation\u2019s fall. When, as recently as a year or two ago, wages were growing at double or more their pre-pandemic pace, many feared that inflation would also remain high. Slowing wage growth has soothed some of those fears, at least for the moment, but both wages and prices will need to continue to slow to put those concerns fully to rest.\n\nWhile wage growth might be slowing down, employers could be finding other ways to attract job seekers that are less costly. As Hiring Lab has documented, salary transparency has become increasingly common in the US, due in part to a rise in local regulations. But employers might also find that advertising what they pay could be a competitive necessity in a still-tight labor market. Wages might not grow as quickly next year, but employers that advertise what they\u2019re paying may find it somewhat easier to attract quality candidates than their competition, which may keep salary information more opaque.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cOver half of jobs on Indeed now include salary information\u201d with a vertical axis ranging from 20% to 50%. Indeed tracked the percentage share of US job postings containing employer-provided salary information monthly from January 2019 to October 2023. The chart shows that the share has increased since early 2020, and reached a series high of 53% in October 2023.\n\nWatch for the usage of Generative AI in jobs that don\u2019t create AI\n\nArtificial intelligence, particularly generative artificial intelligence, rocketed into public consciousness at the end of 2022. These technologies have great potential to reconfigure a wide variety of jobs, and potentially create many more new jobs. The impacts will likely be felt widely but unevenly, with some occupational sectors \u2014 including Software Development \u2014 highly exposed to GenerativeAI, while others \u2014 including Driving \u2014 will feel fewer direct impacts. Even so, regardless of intensity, those effects will take some time to play out.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait to see the long-term effects of GenAI, but it\u2019s clear right now that jobs related to the field are surging. At the beginning of 2023, 0.003% of job postings mentioned terms related to Generative AI. This share stood at 0.06% by the end of October, a 20 times increase. Of course, only 6 in 10,000 job postings means Generative AI jobs aren\u2019t very common, even if they are growing rapidly. Our measure not only captures jobs that create Generative AI tools, but it also accounts for postings that mention if the role will use a GenAI tool. Marketing jobs are a good example \u2014 while most Marketers aren\u2019t actively creating AI tools, they are certainly using them in their work, and showing up in our tracker as a result.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cPercentage (%) of job postings containing GenAI terms.\u201d With a vertical axis ranging from 0.00 to 0.06, and a horizontal axis ranging from January 2020 to October 2023, the graph shows the percentage of job postings containing GenAI terms, and the recent rise of that percentage.\n\nIncreased usage of GenAI and other technologies \u2014 in addition to an increase in jobs developing those tools \u2014 could reshape the broader labor market. GenAI jobs might increase in the years ahead, but if the growth comes primarily from those jobs that create the tools, without corresponding growth in roles that simply use these tools, the economic impact of AI and GenAI could be small. For example, the power of personal computing didn\u2019t become apparent until it was used in a mass capacity, not just in a few technology and research companies. So when it comes to GenAI jobs moving forward, we\u2019ll be sure to track the overall level and the occupational sectors leading the way.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn many ways, these first few post-pandemic years are uncharted territory. More evidence emerges daily that our economic maps and contingency plans may be outdated and insufficient to guide us on what comes next. So far, the labor market has shown that a high-demand environment and tight labor supply need not be permanently inflationary. Wage growth can slow without a spike in unemployment. Workers who left the labor market can be drawn back. The optimistic view of the market may actually be the correct view.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that we are entering a period in which the easiest hurdles on the road to a soft landing have already been cleared, leaving only the highest and most difficult for the last mile of the race. That the labor market\u2019s journey to this point has been relatively painless does not guarantee that actual pain is not coming. The full effects of the past 20 months of tightened monetary policy may be ahead of us, and things may slow further, as is widely expected. And if conditions do not continue to cool as expected, then the Federal Reserve may feel it has no choice but to tighten the screws even further, forcing a more immediate slowdown in place of the only gradual one we\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nThere\u2019s a case for optimism for 2024, but it\u2019s best not to oversell it.\n\nMethodology\n\nData on seasonally adjusted Indeed job postings are an index of the number of seasonally adjusted job postings on a given day, using a seven-day trailing average. February 1, 2020, is our pre-pandemic baseline, so the index is set to 100 on that day. We seasonally adjust each series based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. We adopted this methodology in January 2021. Data for several dates in 2021 and 2022 are missing and were interpolated. Non-seasonally adjusted data are calculated in a similar manner except that the data are not adjusted to historical patterns.\n\nThe number of job postings on Indeed.com, whether related to paid or unpaid job solicitations, is not indicative of potential revenue or earnings of Indeed, which comprises a significant percentage of the HR Technology segment of its parent company, Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. Job posting numbers are provided for information purposes only and should not be viewed as an indicator of the performance of Indeed or Recruit. Please refer to the Recruit Holdings investor relations website and regulatory filings in Japan for more detailed information on revenue generation by Recruit\u2019s HR Technology segment.\n\nTo calculate the average rate of wage growth, we follow an approach similar to the Atlanta Fed US Wage Growth Tracker, but we track jobs, not individuals. We begin by calculating the median posted wage for a given country, month, job title, region, and salary type (hourly, monthly, or annual). Within each country, we then calculate year-on-year wage growth for each job title-region-salary type combination, generating a monthly distribution. Our monthly measure of wage growth for the country is the median of that distribution. Alternative methodologies, such as the regression-based approaches in Marinescu & Wolthoff (2020) and Haefke et al. (2013), produce similar trends. More information about the data and methodology is available in a research paper by Pawel Adrjan and Reamonn Lydon, Wage growth in Europe: evidence from job ads, published in the Central Bank of Ireland\u2019s Economic Letter series.\n\nThe analysis of Generative AI job postings involved extracting job postings directly related to Generative AI, using specific keywords indicating its presence, such as \u201cGenerative AI,\u201d \u201cLarge Language Models,\u201d and \u201cChat GPT.\u201d\n\nWe assess foreign job seeker interest in the US by tracking the share of total clicks on Indeed job postings in the US by job seekers with IP addresses outside of the US. Job seekers whose location could not be determined were removed from the analysis.\n\nWe calculate pay transparency share in US job postings by dividing the number of unique job postings with a salary into a total count of unique advertisements in a given month. Pay information is extracted from postings published on Indeed.com. Salaries advertised as being paid daily or weekly are omitted from the analysis.\n\nThe analysis of the potential increases in the labor force participation rate assumes that labor force participation rates for workers ages 25 to 34, ages 35 to 44, ages 45 to 54, and ages 65 plus would all return to their respective all-time highs. We don\u2019t assume an increase for workers ages 55 to 64 as that group is already at an all-time high.

The tool analyzes an organization\u2019s historical hiring data, and identifies instances of bias related to age, gender, race, education, or previous employer, helping HR professionals to root out bias in its hiring trends and avoid it in the future.\n\nAI has great promise for HR professionals in general\u201333% of CHROs said they believe AI will revolutionize the way they do business over the next few years, a recent IBM study found. However, AI will not fully overtake their roles, or those of all other human employees, the study found\u201365% of CEOs surveyed said that people skills will have a strong impact on their business over the next several years.\n\nThe average hiring manager receives hundreds of applicants a day for certain positions, and can only spend about 6 seconds on each resume, IBM found. Therefore, the ability to make strong decisions without analytics and AI is limited, and can create further unconscious bias in hiring, according a press release.\n\nSEE: IT leader\u2019s guide to the future of artificial intelligence (Tech Pro Research)\n\n\u201cWe see this development as a tool that will put CHROs and HR leaders on the front lines of shaping tomorrow\u2019s workforce,\u201d the release stated. \u201cWe see that workforce as highly personalized at the employee level, highly collaborative across the enterprise, and one that draws on a vast and diverse range of expertise and experience without bias.\u201d\n\nCompanies including BuzzFeed and H&R Block have already used the Adverse Impact Analysis tool, according to the release. IBM\u2019s goal is to ensure organizations select job candidates based on ability alone, the release noted.\n\n\u201cUsing AI trained with unbiased data, an organization can be secure in the knowledge that the chosen candidate was the one best suited for the role,\u201d the release stated. \u201cThe result is a stronger workplace that is more diverse, fosters fresh perspectives, and promotes an inclusive atmosphere free of bias.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that IBM itself is currently facing a lawsuit filed by former employees after a ProPublica report alleged that the company has fired more than 20,000 employees over age 40 in the last six years.\n\nYou can read more tips on how to remove bias based on age, race, and gender on TechRepublic.\n\nThe big takeaways for tech leaders:\n\nIBM Watson Recruitment\u2019s Adverse Impact Analysis tool uses AI to help companies make better, unbiased hires.\n\nThe Adverse Impact Analysis tool analyzes an organization\u2019s historical hiring data, and identifies instances of bias related to age, gender, race, education, or previous employer.",

        "text": "Most of the workers who will form the 15,000 are likely to be trained locally, say experts. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nSINGAPORE \u2013 The goal to increase the number of artificial intelligence (AI) practitioners in Singapore to 15,000 can be achieved quickly, thanks in part to the growing number of AI courses in universities here and reskilling programmes, said experts.\n\nMost of the new faces are likely to be trained locally to build tools using existing AI models, they added, while existing tech employees from other fields, like metaverse technologies, can also contribute to the pool by reskilling.\n\nOn Dec 4, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced the second edition of Singapore\u2019s AI strategy, focusing on ways to prepare the economy to embrace AI, in order to remain competitive.\n\nAs part of the new plan \u2013 dubbed National AI Strategy 2.0: AI for the Public Good for Singapore and the World \u2013 Singapore aims to triple its AI workforce by training locals and hiring from overseas.\n\nThe group includes data and machine-learning scientists and engineers who are the backbone of translating AI into real-world apps, said DPM Wong, who is also Minister for Finance.\n\nDetails of when this is intended to happen were not given.\n\nSingapore has made strides in AI to put its name on the map. Today, it is home to at least 1,100 tech-related start-ups, said DPM Wong. Major AI tech companies like Google and Microsoft have also set up regional headquarters here.\n\nDPM Wong said: \u201cWe are acutely aware that every leading city in the world today wants to be an AI hub... We cannot compete head-on in terms of size or fiscal resources, but we do have several factors in our favour: a highly skilled workforce, a highly wired-up society and, importantly, a trusted ecosystem, where things work and where we can make things happen.\u201d\n\nThe revised strategy has been a long time coming, as schools like the National University of Singapore (NUS) have anticipated the growth of AI, introducing more modules and making AI a compulsory introductory course for all computer science students, said the university\u2019s computing associate professor Soo Yuen Jien.\n\nSingapore\u2019s revamped strategy signals to the industry that it is doubling down on its bet on AI, he added.\n\nMany computing modules have some links to AI, and given that there are more than 4,000 students across all levels at the computing school at any given time, it is not a stretch for Singapore to hit its target in the short term, said Prof Soo.\n\nLikewise, at Nanyang Technological University, new AI-related courses like the Bachelor of Applied Computing in Finance, help students to specialise in applying AI to various fields, said Nanyang Business School deputy dean Boh Wai Fong.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe target of 15,000 is not impossible. There are many courses that bring graduates and undergrads into the sector, and coupled with talent from abroad, we should be well-positioned to develop the talent needed.\u201d\n\nMost of the workers who form the 15,000 are likely to be trained locally. This is due to the rising costs of bringing in foreign talent to fill technical roles, said Associate Professor Ben Leong from the NUS School of Computing.\n\nIt is likely that those in the new wave of AI talent will focus on building apps using existing AI models, said Prof Leong. Most AI tools today do not need to be developed from scratch, but can work off pre-built application programming interfaces like ChatGPT, allowing those without deep tech skills to enter the field.\n\nTo prepare students for the demand for AI apps, NUS has introduced courses to teach students to build apps based on ChatGPT and AI image generators like Dall-E and Stable Diffusion.\n\nSingapore\u2019s emphasis on reskilling the workforce will play a part to funnel workers to take on AI, and keep the workforce nimble for new opportunities in tech, said SAP Labs Singapore managing director Manik Saha. The software developer is among tech companies here that offer upskilling courses to help workers find new jobs .\n\nSingapore has consistently scored high in global rankings in digital competitiveness, noted assistant professor of computer science Soujanya Poria at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, adding that this is largely thanks to its coordinated efforts to digitalise.\n\n\u201cThe new strategy is robust and shows the whole system can work together to support AI development. It starts from schools to government supporting the vision by pushing for adequate infrastructure,\u201d said Prof Soujanya.\n\nProf Leong from NUS , who is also the director of the Centre for Computing for Social Good and Philanthropy \u2013 a school to encourage students to serve the community and to cultivate a philanthropic ethos among future generations of tech leaders \u2013 said: \u201c(Most new hires) will probably work on simpler AI models because harder ones will require more training. That\u2019s where foreign manpower might come in, but they are not easy to get now because of rising costs.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAI gets very deep, but you can\u2019t churn out experts in a hurry.\u201d\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.",

        "text": "Why Is AI Important in Upskilling and Reskilling?\n\nArtificial intelligence is an important component of upskilling and reskilling initiatives because it can help simplify and improve processes that would otherwise be tedious, difficult, and time-consuming. For employers considering whether their workforce needs to upskill and reskill, one big challenge is understanding what skills exist in the organization, who has those skills, and how those skills map to the jobs of tomorrow. Connecting those dots\u2014employees to skills to jobs\u2014without technology requires a lot of heavy lifting and manual work for both HR managers and employees. With AI, businesses can prepare for future skill requirements and emerging trends in the job market by proactively identifying skills gaps and designing upskilling and reskilling programs that align with workforce needs, now and into the future.\n\nFor employees, AI can provide personalized recommendations for what training would be most valuable in their current role or desired career path. Upskilling and reskilling programs are important for engaging and retaining workers, and AI can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these initiatives. A recent Gallup poll found that nearly half of US employees are open to improving their existing skills and eager to embrace new ones. More than 40% of American workers surveyed said they highly value the career development programs offered by their employer while 48% said they\u2019d be open to a career change if the employer offered skills training opportunities. But that same poll also found that only 2% of chief human resources officers strongly agree that their upskilling initiatives are actually cultivating the skills that employees will need in the future. Technologies such as AI can help organizations fill skills gaps and make employee training programs more beneficial to both businesses and their workers.",

        "text": "Mar 5, 2025\n\nThe rapid emergence, excitement and adoption of AI among organizations is changing how we work at an unparalleled pace. But while AI promises to deliver a slew of productivity and innovation gains, the biggest concern is how it will affect jobs in the future, with an estimated 400 million jobs to be eliminated by 2030.\n\nTo combat this, over 85% of employers plan to prioritize reskilling their workforce, according to a recent World Economic Forum report. Reskilling offers irrefutable benefits to employees, providing them with new skills to advance in their roles and careers. For employers, reskilling also ensures that workers can develop the skills necessary for the fast-changing workplace, while boosting employee productivity, morale and retention.\n\nHowever, traditional reskilling was not built for this moment. The labor market transformation is already happening as organizations \u2013 including Meta, Workday and DBS \u2013 are diverting resources to AI and slashing jobs. The trend is expected to continue, with 41% of employers planning to downsize their workforce as AI increasingly takes over certain tasks. Additionally, a recent survey of CHROs found that a mere 7% are implementing reskilling strategies for jobs that will be replaced by AI.\n\nTraditional Reskilling Does Not Meet Today\u2019s Needs\n\nHistorically, one of the biggest challenges in reskilling is the time required to develop the learning & development (L&D) programs to effectively boost workers\u2019 existing skills. For HR and L&D professionals, simply identifying skill gaps and anticipating future needs is just the start of the process. HR leaders require C-level buy-in to design and develop reskilling coursework, which then requires precious time to be taken away from other business activities for the training to be rolled out. For L&D professionals, many hours are also needed to schedule the training, create learner to-dos, set up event reminders, provide adequate learning support, track progress, and assess employee performance and results.\n\nThis extensive time and cost investment in reskilling means that it\u2019s no wonder that companies are seemingly sidelining such efforts to focus on immediate gains. It can take an organization 18 to 24 months to develop a new upskilling program\u2014-and in that time, the needs of the organization, and potentially even the skills themselves have changed.\n\nRapid Reskilling, Now Made Possible\n\nWhile perceptions exist even among L&D and HR leaders that reskilling is too time-consuming and expensive, the irony is that AI is now able to address these core issues. For example, the most time-consuming aspects of reskilling initiatives lie in administrative tasks, including scheduling, sending announcements to employees, nudging them to complete any activities or coursework, tracking participation and progress (often through some kind of learning management system), and collecting post-training feedback to help refine future programs. Today, AI can greatly decrease or eliminate these tasks, giving L&D professionals time to concentrate on the reskilling program itself, and expanding it throughout the organization.\n\nFor example, at one organization we work with \u2013 a multinational food company \u2013 using AI-powered automation, improved the number of learners in a \u201chigh-touch\u201d program by over 9x while slashing the workload by over 50%. This allowed the L&D team to focus on higher-impact initiatives rather than tasks such as scheduling, attendance tracking, and follow-ups. Another customer, Procore, has developed technology courses for their engineering organization in a matter of days, not months\u2014allowing them to be agile and responsive to the shifting needs of the organization.\n\nAdditionally, AI is addressing one of the long-held challenges that companies have faced when it comes to reskilling: does it actually work?\n\nIn his famous Two Sigma Problem paper, Benjamin Bloom discovered that students who receive one-on-one tutoring perform significantly better than those in traditional classrooms\u2014with a gap so large it seemed impossible to bridge on a large scale. But today, with AI-powered personalized learning, we are on the brink of realizing this long-elusive promise. AI can deliver adaptive, real-time feedback, tailor educational content to individual needs, and simulate the benefits of expert tutoring for millions. This revolution in reskilling means that workers can rapidly and efficiently acquire new competencies, ensuring that they remain competitive in an era of relentless technological change. AI can now role play scenarios, practice tough leadership situations, give personalized feedback on coding assignments, and keep employees motivated with the right support. What once seemed like a utopia for education is now a reality, opening up unprecedented opportunities for lifelong learning.\n\nEmbracing Meaningful Learning\n\nWhile deprioritizing reskilling may not have overt ramifications initially, if it\u2019s not a consistent priority it will have compounding issues for both individuals and employers. For employees, a lack of reskilling opportunities can foster greater job dissatisfaction, reduced job security, and career stagnation.\n\nMeanwhile, companies that are perceived to disregard or deprioritize skills programs could face challenges in hiring and retaining staff, and a backlash against their brands. When Meta recently announced job cuts while simultaneously investing in more AI projects, criticism from laid off workers was swift, outspoken and severe. And when nearly half (48%) of American workers say that they\u2019d switch jobs if it provided skills training opportunities, reskilling is a simple yet effective strategy to drive positive attitudes and morale. Moreover, it\u2019s ultimately a waste of resources\u2014-finding talent that fits a company\u2019s bar and culture is expensive. It is far cheaper to reskill people in the future job needs\u2013organizations can save around $20,000 per employee by building skills from within, rather than hiring externally\n\nAI is undeniably transforming the skills and jobs landscape, making upskilling and reskilling more critical than ever. But tackling this challenge with outdated methods is a losing battle. To keep pace with change, organizations must embrace AI-native tools that accelerate reskilling, streamline learning, and deliver highly personalized experiences. The future of work belongs to those who can adapt\u2014and the key to adaptation is not just learning new skills, but doing so with the speed and precision that only AI can enable.",

Sign Up Sign Up\n\n\u201cWith AI, it\u2019s almost the same thing \u2013 just that now, that job can be performed by a machine,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and Sachdev were speaking in the panel discussion at the conference on AI in business and finance, hosted by Singapore Management University (SMU) and held on the university campus.\n\nOther panellists were Vincent Lim, chief executive officer of Eco Sustainability Group, and Ken Guo, CEO of Revulate Technologies. The discussion was moderated by Zhang Hong, professor of finance at SMU.\n\nGuo noted that, for smaller companies, identifying the instances where AI can replace certain job functions is \u201ckind of the easy part\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt (just) has to fit certain criteria, right? Is it repetitive? Is it predictable? You just go down this list and you\u2019ll be able to find opportunities in every organisation, as long as data is used.\u201d\n\nHe added that the bigger challenge lies in determining what a worker\u2019s new role will be once his or her job function is replaced by AI.\n\nAssuming the objective is to retain human capital, it then becomes a challenge for the human resources department to determine how best to manage this \u2013 including efforts to reskill and upskill employees, Guo said.\n\nThe sustainability of AI\n\nThursday\u2019s panel also discussed the sustainability implications of AI. The technology has come under scrutiny because of its significant energy consumption, in that vast computational resources are needed for both training and real-time deployment.\n\nThis has raised concerns about the environmental impact of AI, even as companies hope to leverage it for greater efficiency and productivity, the panellists said.\n\nBut Eco Sustainability\u2019s Lim noted that the efficiencies brought by AI far outweigh the environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short answer to the question, but AI wins against sustainability concerns, because AI can help sustainability (as a concept) achieve its higher goal,\u201d he said.\n\nTeo Ser Luck, president of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants, said in his keynote address at the conference that the Singapore government has dedicated significant resources to advancing research, fostering innovation and establishing a robust regulatory framework for AI development.\n\nHe emphasised the government\u2019s \u201cgreat responsibility\u201d in ensuring that AI\u2019s ethical considerations and the moral implications are addressed.\n\nTeo also noted Singapore\u2019s goal to triple its AI workforce to 15,000, and that upskilling opportunities are available through initiatives like SkillsFuture, which offers over 600 AI-related courses.",

        "text": "Reskilling can help technology professionals achieve success in the coming years, as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape the software development industry by creating new business opportunities and reducing development timelines, according to AI experts and coaches who spoke to The Express Tribune.\n\nDHA Suffa University Karachi's Dean of the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, Prof Dr Zafar Nasir, stated, \"AI's monumental growth has brought about a significant change in the overall landscape of software development and has profoundly impacted the software industry.\"\n\nAccording to 'Grand View Research', the global AI market is projected to grow 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. AI in software development is expected to attract substantial investment in the near future, as it serves as a catalyst for staffing needs, enables the creation of highly personalised products, and helps businesses expand their customer base.\n\nA recent survey found that 58% of NYSE-listed companies identified AI investment as a key driver for developing new revenue streams. As AI technologies continue to evolve, their business applications will become more apparent. Based on customer surveys, more than 70% of NYSE-listed companies have shown interest in investing in AI for customer service. This shift is also diminishing the traditional experience premium, as AI is narrowing the gap between industry experts and novices.\n\nCalling for a paradigm shift in workforce reskilling, Dr Zafar Nasir highlighted that nearly 25% of jobs will undergo rapid transformations. The 14% productivity boost observed in customer service agents using Generative AI reflects the evolving workplace dynamics. As AI redefines job roles, organisations must adopt agile redeployment strategies to retain skilled talent while transitioning from traditional practices to more specialised, skill-based functions.\n\nAccording to the Mercer Survey, 60% of employees prefer working for skill-based organisations. This trend bodes well for businesses looking to automate their processes with AI-driven applications.\n\nNasir further explained that AI is reshaping the software industry by automating multiple aspects of the development cycle, including code generation, testing, deployment, and security. This transformation allows engineers to focus on high-level problem-solving, such as architectural planning, system integration, decision-making, and other creative challenges that drive innovation and efficiency. AI-powered training systems can also provide personalised learning paths, ensuring professionals remain updated.\n\nAdditionally, AI fosters agile and cost-effective strategies that align with market dynamics, such as evolving consumer demands and manufacturing processes. AI-powered design software can generate multiple optimised designs for a single product.\n\n\"AI has the potential to alter the overall dynamics of software development and maximise throughput. This is particularly true in the context of AI coding tools, which provide a strategic advantage in task completion and productivity enhancement,\" he said.\n\nRenowned SEO expert and IT coach Mehboob Shar, Founder and CEO of Icreativez Technologies, said, \"AI is significantly accelerating software development processes. While a 12-fold increase in efficiency may seem ambitious, AI enables tasks that previously took hundreds of hours of programmer time to be completed in minutes, simply by generating the right prompts,\" Shar stated.\n\nAt Icreativez Technologies, AI has enabled developers and software engineers to complete tasks within a single day that previously required weeks. As a result, teams that once managed only one project at a time can now handle multiple projects concurrently.\n\nTech strategist and National Incubation Centre (NIC) Karachi Project Director Syed Azfar Husain said, AI is reshaping software development by making coding, testing, and deployment faster and more efficient. Tools like GitHub Copilot assist developers in writing code faster. AI has also contributed to major business successes\u0097Netflix uses AI to optimise cloud costs, while startups like UiPath have grown into billion-dollar enterprises by automating business processes.\n\nBeyond the corporate world, AI presents exciting opportunities for universities to introduce AI-driven courses and research programmes. By integrating AI into their operations, businesses can enhance productivity, reduce costs, and drive innovation, ensuring long-term growth in an increasingly technology-driven landscape.\n\nPakistan's software developers can leverage AI by incorporating machine learning and automation into their solutions, making products smarter and more competitive on a global scale. As Pakistan moves towards formulating its first-ever AI Policy in 2025, developers can align with government initiatives for funding, policy support, and regulatory clarity. AI frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch facilitate advanced applications, while low-code and no-code AI tools accelerate development cycles.\n\nStartups can build AI solutions for agriculture, healthcare, and fintech, addressing local challenges. Collaborating with universities and AI research hubs can also foster innovation.",

        "text": "A transformative path opens up as we begin to use artificial intelligence to change companies and redefine corporate learning and development. In this article, I will investigate the dynamic road toward flawless human-AI cooperation in the workplace of tomorrow, and how L&D becomes a strategic compass guiding companies through this fascinating development.\n\nOne fascinating truth about the interaction between humans and technology is that\u2014although they are its creators\u2014they have often feared technology before finally embracing it as an ally in the simplification of life. Growing up in the pre-Internet age, I saw great anxiety around implementing computers in businesses. It was almost funny how these same people have changed their attitude over the next ten years, praising IT endlessly for generating affluent prospects and placing their nation on the international employment scene.\n\nIn what good ways will the AI revolution change life and employment? As any new technology is as good as humans create, it is impossible to forecast. If the AI revolution promotes a time of cooperation between people and AI instead of one of rivalry, it will be a gift. By equipping employees to flourish in an AI-augmented environment, HR and L&D must be central in determining a promising future.\n\nThroughout this change, HR and L&D must cooperate to create a symbiotic link between human knowledge and AI capacity in contemporary companies. Focusing on their different roles, they must be at the forefront of strategic, multi-dimensional projects. An efficient reskilling or upskilling program should include four elements:\n\nUsing strategic upskilling to empower the staff with the necessary skills to coexist peacefully with AI.\n\nUsing tools and approaches helps to preserve crucial human knowledge and facilitates cross-generational interaction.\n\nCreating customized training plans to improve human-AI cooperation.\n\nEncouragement of ongoing interactive group learning.\n\nNext, I will closely examine every dimension and explain how each helps build human-AI cooperation.\n\nStrategic importance of L&D in employee reskill and upskill program\n\nIf businesses already fund AIe technologies, why should they invest in reskilling or upskilling staff? Does it not sound like two expenses? This is where one should grasp the essence of AI transformation: It is all about improving rather than replacing employees\u2019 capabilities. The investment today is equivalent to tomorrow\u2019s empowered workforce. Let us dig further to grasp how. Though they are usually used synonymously, \u201creskill\u201d and \u201cupskill\u201d have different connotations.\n\nReskilling is teaching staff members to acquire new skills so they may move into positions arising from the integration of AI. Generative AI can, for instance, transform data analysts into insights architects who use AI to generate predictive models, run simulations and provide actionable insights.\n\nConversely, upskilling emphasizes improving employees\u2019 skill sets to adjust to AI-driven changes in their current roles, such as using AI tools to maximize workflows or evaluate challenging datasets.\n\nTherefore, organizations need both strategies to ensure their staff can efficiently negotiate the changing AI terrain.\n\nUpskill: Closing the skill gap to reach AI competency\n\nProgram designers of upskilling projects must remember a critical element: Generative technology develops quickly, continuously changing job roles and task execution methods. As a result, companies will probably always be short-staffed in personnel qualified in the most recent technologies.\n\nThus, two main elements of upskilling strategies should be:\n\nShort-term skill gap solutions for quick organizational needs.\n\nLong-term upskilling plans to reach constant benchmarks in line with the company\u2019s future objectives.\n\nPrograms should match long-term goals with short-term priorities and align skill levels with both. This requires close cooperation with the CIO\u2019s office in choosing suitable tools and resources.\n\nAn effective upskilling process can follow these steps:\n\nSkill inventory: List the present AI-related competencies of the workforce.\n\nNeeds assessment: List both short- and long-term skill needs.\n\nPersonalized learning plans: Design customized road maps for each employee based on organizational goals and skill gap analysis.\n\nReskilling employees within the organization\n\nReskilling in the context of AI is acquiring fresh skills that are fit for a new employment role. Under the cover of its Machine Learning University, Amazon, for instance, has established a reskilling program that helps thousands of workers with little machine learning knowledge become experts in the field.\n\nReskilling can be a strategic weapon for companies to balance workforce supply and demand. As AI and machine learning technologies advance rapidly, they have significantly reduced the average life cycle of skills. Training staff members in artificial intelligence skills will help companies remain ready for an AI-augmented future and allow current employees\u2019 skills to be utilized in newly appointed positions.\n\nLike upskilling, reskilling programs are meant to be developed closely in line with corporate strategy, with active participation of all stakeholders and a clear vision of how such projects may support the business\u2019s long-term objectives.\n\nThe stakeholders, sponsors and the whole company should be involved. In fact, reskilling programs should be strategically crucial for L&D to share with the entire company since it is difficult for such projects to reach the intended result without group effort, partnerships and involvement. Developing the appropriate attitude and actions among managers and staff is quite important. Many times, employees object to learning. Including training in the process will help them address any challenges.\n\nThus, L&D should invest in specific tools, systems and policies to support their reskilling projects. L&D should develop a matrix to match employees\u2019 intended career paths with their skills. Businesses can handle redundancies in AI-augmented environments through strategic reskilling and ultimately prevent future layoffs.\n\nBuilding AI-ready teams across the organization: One key point to remember\n\nOrganizations should include introductory training courses in AI for staff members at all levels to maximize the advantages of AI-driven reskilling and upskilling. Success in an AI-driven workforce depends on specific fundamental abilities and training areas. Here are some recommendations:\n\nData analysis: Skills in data interpretation and visualization define data analysis.\n\nProgramming: Foundation of Python, Java or R for AI system knowledge.\n\nMachine learning: fundamental ideas to modify AI tools\n\nCommunication: Effective cooperation with AI systems.\n\nPreserving and transferring human expertise to AI systems\n\nAI needs more than raw data to accomplish tasks with human-like discretion; it also requires critical thinking and judgment from years of expertise in a related field. Human experience is the total knowledge workers pick up over time. Not only is it difficult to express in words, but this complex and priceless body of knowledge is context-specific and cannot be codified into a mechanism. Capturing and embedding this knowledge into AI models becomes increasingly important as companies advance in their path of AI transformation. Training AI with this domain knowledge requires a team effort to translate seasoned employee insights into AI systems.\n\nOnce more, this is where L&D must be crucial. The process starts with a talent map\u2014a study of employee profiles, performance data and skill sets meant to find workforce clusters of expertise. Once these critical areas are found, they form the basis for creating training models that let human knowledge weave naturally into AI. Leading this initiative guarantees L&D that AI systems are enhanced with the depth of human knowledge and are data-driven.\n\nInterviews, seminars and surveys with seasoned staff members will help L&D compile real-world scenarios, problem-solving models and decision-making frameworks as inputs. These priceless repositories of information ought then to be compiled into training sets. L&D should thus have access to already-existing materials, including project reports, case studies, decision trees, client comments and resources simultaneously. Between various business divisions and AI developers, they can serve as coordinators, guaranteeing the flawless integration of these insights into AI algorithms. In this sense, L&D can be trusted to build a scalable framework for passing knowledge to AI.\n\nThe use of AI-powered tailored training programs to enhance their effectiveness\n\nAlthough reskilling and up-learning staff members is a crucial responsibility, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Effective skill development depends on customized learning paths that fit every employee\u2019s demands, preferences, and learning styles.\n\nFascinatingly, artificial intelligence tools can let trainers design top-notch tailored courses. By including artificial intelligence in their systems, training managers can get insights, including performance data, past learning history, skill shortages, and career goals. These realizations enable trainers to better grasp every employee\u2019s learning path and create initiatives promoting their development.\n\nAI-powered tools can examine vast amounts of data, precisely find trends and gaps, and suggest customized learning materials formats and timelines for every employee. Thus, employees can learn quickly, emphasizing areas requiring the most attention and strengthening their abilities.\n\nOne advantage of these customized initiatives is that they change and grow instantly. For example, AI can recommend extra materials or alternative approaches\u2014such as interactive simulations or gamified learning\u2014should students struggle with a given topic to help them grasp it. Similarly, using advanced modules allows high-performance workers to be fast-tracked to guarantee they remain challenged and involved.\n\nFostering continuous learning: An important facet of AI-transformation\n\nReskilling, upskilling and ultimately uplifting your workforce for an AI-first future is a path of lifelong learning and not a one-time project. L&D can play a crucial role by acting pro-actively in the following ways:\n\nInvolve those in charge: Set aside funds to support certifications, training initiatives and involvement by C-suit executives and business unit heads.\n\nCreate a learning-friendly environment: Establish a learning-friendly environment that goes much beyond allowing staff members\u2019 schedules to be flexible. A learning-friendly environment inspires and motivates employees to learn. Hence, a system of recognition and rewards has to be rather crucial for developing skills.\n\nEncourage knowledge sharing: Let staff members grow with and learn from one another through mentoring programs, knowledge-sharing events and internal communities. The intention is to use group knowledge for mutual development.\n\nFocus on responsible AI use: Within the framework of AI\u2014particularly training for accountability and efficient application is also necessary.\n\nHow to optimize AI tools: Effective prompting methods should be taught since the structure of searches dramatically affects the quality of AI outputs.\n\nSecurity and privacy implications: Users must be aware of possible hazards, including unintentionally distributing private data via AI prompts, and learn best practices to minimize these hazards.\n\nContinuing education about the tools\u2019 nature is essential for maximizing their advantages and minimizing their negative effects. Organizations can guarantee responsibility and innovation by enabling staff members to use AI boldly and ethically.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe AI revolution should be presented as something that improves production and promotes economic development rather than as a cause for rivalry between people and machines. L&D and HR cannot cover this load by themselves. Meaningful AI transformation calls for coordinated organizational effort involving stakeholders from all departments and levels, working strategically from the beginning.\n\nOrganizations can transform obstacles into opportunities and guarantee a sustainable, creative future by encouraging an environment of lifelong learning whereby every employee is ready to coexist with AI.",

Employers also play a crucial role in bridging this gap by offering clear guidance and accessible learning opportunities, as aligned with Singapore\u2019s Smart Nation 2.0 strategy. Without this ongoing support and drive to reskill, local talent will struggle to adapt professionally in the evolving AI landscape,\u201d\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJobstreet provided the following summary of the report.\n\nRoom for growth for GenAI usage in Singapore\n\nThe report reveals that while 60% of Singaporean talent have tried GenAI in their work or personal life, only 43% of Singaporean talent use it monthly \u2013 just on par with Southeast Asia\u2019s 44%.\n\nWhile the high adoption rate can be attributed to Singapore\u2019s National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0), a significant portion of Singaporean talent (40%) still remain unfamiliar with GenAI\u2019s capabilities. Although Singapore has a promising base for GenAI usage, there is considerable room for growth which both employers and employees can contribute to.\n\nThe impact of GenAI in Singapore\n\nDespite a reluctance to reskill, talent in Singapore have concerns about the effects of GenAI with regards to job security and displacement of roles, with only 19% believing GenAI will not affect their job. Further, 22% of Singaporean talent also expect major impacts that will eliminate or transform their jobs significantly, slightly lower compared to the regional figure of 29%.\n\n\u201cAI\u2019s impact is undeniable, and it is essential for both individuals and employers in Singapore to start taking proactive steps in reskilling and future-proofing our workforce.\u201d\n\nHowever, GenAI\u2019s ability to reduce non-essential tasks (60%) and improve work quality (45%) is widely recognized by Singaporean talent as its biggest benefits \u2013 yet, its use for meeting deadlines and improving speed remains underutilized (32%). This lags behind both their Southeast Asian (44%) and global peers (45%), highlighting the need for a greater focus on practical applications of GenAI in increasing productivity.\n\nWhat Challenges are holding Singaporeans back from embracing GenAI?\n\nDespite an interest in using GenAI, challenges such as difficulty in writing prompts and having a lack of skills are putting off local talent from fully leveraging GenAI\u2019s capabilities, with 37% citing this as a significant roadblock.\n\nThis figure is notably higher than the regional average of 33% and the global average of 30%, suggesting that Singaporean workers lack the necessary skills or support in utilising GenAI, which hinders the effective use of GenAI.\n\nLow priority in improving advanced digital skills and understanding new trends\n\nWhen it comes to reskilling, Singaporean talent appears more focused on traditional skills, namely improving analytical skills (46%), functional and job-specific skills (35%), and project management (27%). Meanwhile, advanced digital skills (like software development and AI) and understanding new trends (like AI, advancement in science) rank much lower in priority, at 22% and 19% respectively.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to reskilling, Singaporean talent appears more focused on traditional skills, namely improving analytical skills (46%), functional and job-specific skills (35%), and project management (27%).\u201d\n\nAs Singapore navigates the AI revolution, there is a crucial role for employers to play in supporting their workforce\u2019s transition. The report finds that 51% of Singaporean talent expressed a need for more guidance on what skills to learn, while 46% highlighted the need for better learning courses. Furthermore, 36% pointed to the need for more employer support in adopting GenAI in the workplace.\n\nThese findings reveal an opportunity for Singaporean employers to bridge the GenAI skills gap by offering targeted training and raising awareness of the specific skills needed to thrive in an AI-driven future. With proactive efforts from companies, Singapore\u2019s workforce can better position itself for the demands of tomorrow.\n\nThese report insights are from a new report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), The Network, of which Jobstreet by SEEK is a part of, and The Stepstone Group. The study is based on survey data from more than 150,000 respondents in the workforce spanning 188 countries.",

        "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept\u2014it\u2019s here and transforming industries. Yet, Singaporeans seem cautious in their adoption of AI technologies.\n\nAccording to a Jobstreet report, featured by the Singapore Business Review (SBR), only 53% of Singaporean workers are willing to reskill to stay relevant in the AI era. Meanwhile, 41% would only consider reskilling if absolutely necessary, despite growing concerns over job displacement or transformation due to generative AI (GenAI).\n\nWith AI taking on mundane tasks and improving work efficiency, workers are now focusing on the skills that machines can\u2019t easily replicate. Here\u2019s how Singaporeans are staying competitive amidst the AI revolution.\n\n1. Sharpening analytical skills for a data-driven world\n\nAI thrives on data, making analytical skills a hot commodity. Four in 10 Singaporeans are improving their ability to think critically, analyse complex information, and conduct research. These skills help workers interpret AI-driven insights, solve intricate problems, and make informed decisions in an increasingly automated workplace.\n\nWith AI taking over repetitive tasks, the ability to strategically apply data insights has become more critical than ever.\n\n2. Focusing on functional and job-specific expertise\n\nBeyond broad skills, Singaporeans are diving deep into their job-specific abilities. Whether it\u2019s accounting, sales, finance, or technical know-how, 35% of workers are polishing their expertise to maintain an edge.\n\nThis approach highlights the value of combining AI capabilities with human domain knowledge to optimise processes and results.\n\n3. Mastering project management\n\nManaging people and projects is a distinctly human skill that AI can support but not replicate.\n\nAbout 27% of Singaporean workers are strengthening their project management capabilities to oversee complex workflows, delegate tasks, and ensure team alignment\u2014roles that are critical in environments where humans and machines collaborate.\n\n4. Embracing creativity and innovation\n\nWhile AI can generate ideas, human creativity remains irreplaceable.\n\n24% of Singaporean workers are nurturing their creative and innovative abilities to bring fresh perspectives, solve unique problems, and design original solutions.\n\nCreativity is increasingly valued in fields like marketing, product development, and content creation, where AI serves as a tool rather than the creator.\n\n5. Developing advanced digital skills\n\nUnderstanding how to work with emerging technologies is vital in an AI-driven economy.\n\n22% of Singaporeans are upskilling in advanced digital competencies, including programming, data analysis, and AI literacy, to better integrate and utilise AI tools in their industries.\n\nThese skills bridge the gap between human effort and AI capabilities, enabling workers to leverage technology effectively.\n\nHow Singaporeans are reskilling and the challenges faced\n\nDespite these efforts, Singaporeans spend less time on learning and development compared to their Southeast Asian peers.\n\nIn 2023, 19% of Singaporeans reported dedicating no time to upskilling, above the regional average of 13%.\n\nWhen they do reskill, they prefer practical, flexible learning methods:\n\n47% rely on on-the-job training.\n\n40% opt for self-study.\n\nMany turn to online videos (36%), employer-sponsored courses (36%), or mobile apps (27%).\n\nSingaporean workers are clear about what\u2019s holding them back:\n\n51% need guidance on which skills to learn.\n\n46% cite a lack of high-quality learning courses.\n\n36% point to insufficient employer support for GenAI adoption.\n\nEmployers can play a pivotal role by shifting their focus from degrees to skills and creating strategic upskilling programs.\n\nStaying ahead of the AI curve\n\nSBR also noted that based on Jobstreet\u2019s Decoding Global Talent 2024 Singapore report, it highlighted the growing shift toward skills-based hiring. As companies face workforce gaps, particularly in ageing economies, the emphasis on academic credentials is slowly being replaced by valuing skills, experience, and potential.\n\nTo build a skills-focused workforce, companies need to rethink how they assess talent, focusing less on qualifications and more on real-world competencies.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, Singaporeans must adapt to remain competitive. By honing these five skills and embracing flexible learning methods, workers can not only keep pace with the AI revolution but thrive in it.\n\nFor Singaporeans, the key lies in balancing technical expertise with human-centric skills\u2014after all, machines may be smart, but it\u2019s humans who drive innovation.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Singapore Global Network",

July 31, 2024 - Today, the AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium\u2013led by Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) with industry leaders Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft and SAP, along with key advisors\u2013released its inaugural report, \u201cThe Transformational Opportunity of AI on ICT Jobs.\u201d This comprehensive analysis provides an unprecedented look at the effects of artificial intelligence on nearly 50 top information and communication technology (ICT) jobs, offering actionable training recommendations to enable an AI-powered workforce.\n\nThe initiative and resulting report seek to empower workers to reskill and upskill with recommendations underscored by today\u2019s evolving job requirements. With the introduction of technology and tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Midjourney and further emergence of AI tools, workers must prepare for digital work environments increasingly adept at mimicking human capabilities. According to a recent World Economic Forum study, 58 percent of surveyed employees believe their job skills will change significantly in the next five years due to AI and big data.\n\n\u201cAI represents a never-before-seen opportunity for technology to benefit humankind in every way, and we have to act intentionally to make sure populations don't get left behind,\u201d said Francine Katsoudas, Chief People, Policy & Purpose Officer, Cisco, and founding member of the AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium. \u201cAcross the Consortium member companies, we have made it our collective responsibility to train and upskill 95 million people over the next 10 years. By investing in a long-term roadmap for an inclusive workforce, we can help everyone participate and thrive in the era of AI.\u201d\n\nKey Findings: Every Job Becomes an AI-Influenced Job\n\nKey findings from the report offer a holistic view of the impact of AI on ICT jobs, empowering workers and employers to embrace the AI-driven future of work:\n\n\u25cf 92 percent of ICT jobs analyzed are expected to undergo either high or moderate transformation due to advancements in AI.\n\n\u25cf Entry-level and mid-level ICT professionals are at the forefront of AI transformation with 40 percent of mid-level positions and 37 percent of entry level positions expected to have high levels of transformation.\n\n\u25cf As AI continues to redefine job functions, certain skills will rise in importance (such as AI ethics, responsible AI, prompt engineering, AI literacy, Large Language Models [LLM] architecture and agile methodologies), while others may become less relevant (traditional data management, content creation, documentation maintenance, basic programming and languages, and research information).\n\n\u25cf Foundational skills are needed across ICT job roles for AI preparedness, including AI literacy, data analytics and prompt engineering.\n\nActionable Insights for Workers and Employers\n\nThe Consortium report provides a thorough examination of AI\u2019s impact on 47 information and communication technology roles across seven job families via a Job Transformation Canvas. The roles were selected based upon the highest volume of job postings for the period of February 2023-2024 in the U.S. and Europe, according to Indeed Hiring Lab. Taking a skills-based approach, the Job Transformation Canvas describes each role inclusive of a job description, principal tasks and corresponding skills.\n\nThe Job Transformation Canvas goes further to outline how AI will influence each role and identify future skills required, skills made less relevant by AI as well as those complemented by it. Workers can use the Job Transformation Canvas as a training companion as they ready for an AI-fueled job market. Employers can leverage the report as a training development guide to cultivate and enable their AI-ready workforces.\n\nThe AI-Enabled ICT Consortium report resides at https://www.cisco.com/c/m/ai-enabled-ict-workforce-consortium.html for workers and employers to navigate jobs roles of interest\u2013from business analyst and data scientist to IT manager to information security specialist\u2013across seven job families including: business and management, cybersecurity, data science, design and user experience, infrastructure and operations, software development, and testing and quality assurance. Each ICT job receives an AI-impact evaluation with detailed recommendations for reskilling and upskilling. The core skills and training recommendations enable employers to take immediate action.\n\nOur Commitment to Training\n\nThe report complements the Consortium members\u2019 commitment to building an inclusive workforce with family-sustaining and economy-developing opportunities. Consortium members have committed to developing worker pathways particularly in job sectors that will increasingly integrate AI technology. To that end, Consortium members have established forward-thinking goals with skills development and training opportunities to positively impact over 95 million individuals around the world over the next 10 years. Consortium member goals include:\n\n\u25cf Cisco to train 25 million people with cybersecurity and digital skills by 2032.\n\n\u25cf IBM to skill 30 million individuals by 2030 in digital skills, including 2 million in AI by the end of 2026.\n\n\u25cf Intel to empower more than 30 million people with AI skills for current and future jobs by 2030.\n\n\u25cf Microsoft committed to training and certifying 10 million people in digital skills by 2025, surpassing this goal by training and certifying 12.6 million people a year ahead of schedule.\n\n\u25cf SAP to upskill two million people worldwide by 2025.\n\n\u25cf Google has recently announced over $130 million in funding to support AI training and skills for people across the US, Europe, Africa, Latin America and APAC.\n\nExpanding Impact to Empower Workers and Employers Across the Globe\n\nIn June 2024, in response to feedback from leaders across the globe, the AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium expanded its scope to include all G7 countries\u2014adding Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom to the analysis of the most in-demand ICT job roles. During the next phase of Consortium work, analysis of jobs and presentation of best practices will be inclusive of the additional countries. The Consortium also plans to introduce an AI Workforce Playbook, designed to empower SMBs and large companies to upskill their workforce proactively.\n\nSupport from AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium Members\n\nAccenture\n\n\u201cAs we look to unlock the full promise that AI brings, it is essential that we equip people with the skills they will need, and which they are eager to learn. The far-reaching impact of this technology demands that we design learning pathways that will position everyone to have deeper AI skills as the work in our industry requires. The initial report from the Consortium is an important step to turn aspiration to action \u2013 with specific reskilling recommendations that can accelerate progress for individuals, organizations, and society.\u201d \u2013 Ellyn Shook, Chief Leadership & Human Resources Officer at Accenture\n\nEightfold\n\n\u201cThis report clearly demonstrates the immediate impact of AI on almost any career, regardless of industry or size. Creating a talent-centered organization, in which the entire workforce can learn and grow responsibly, is the next step for every successful business.\u201d \u2013 Ashutosh Garg, Co-CEO and Co-founder at Eightfold AI\n\nGoogle\n\n\u201cThe benefits of AI must be accessible to every worker. We're proud to support the Consortium's new research, which will advance our shared vision to equip all workers with the AI skills they need to succeed in the jobs of today and tomorrow.\u201d \u2013 Lisa Gevelber, Founder of Grow with Google\n\nIBM\n\n\u201cAt IBM, we have been investing in the future of work through access to education and training opportunities for decades. The findings of this report further highlight the significant need for upskilling and reskilling, particularly with the rise of AI. Now, those in the ICT sector \u2014 from students to workers to employers \u2014 have the data about which jobs will change, how they will change, and what individuals and employers can do to prepare for this shift and remain competitive in the evolving global labor market.\u201d \u2013 Lydia Logan, Vice President, Global Education and Workforce Development at IBM\n\nIndeed\n\n\u201cWe are excited by the impactful work this group is doing to understand the likely impact of AI on ICT workers and provide employers with the resources to support their workforce through this transformation. Indeed's mission is to help people get jobs. As AI skills rise in prominence, we\u2019re prioritizing skills-first hiring, to help job seekers demonstrate their AI capabilities and to connect employers to the broadest possible pool of talented job seekers across a broad range of industries.\u201d \u2013 Hannah Calhoon, Head of AI Innovation at Indeed\n\nIntel\n\n\u201cWe believe AI represents a paradigm shift with great potential to deliver new opportunities and tools, and our goal is to advance AI responsibly to help solve the world\u2019s most significant challenges. Training, upskilling and reskilling workers on how to collaborate with AI and be critical thinkers is vital to our workforce and our next generation of innovation.\u201d \u2013 Christy Pambianchi, Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer at Intel Corporation\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\u201cAI can be a tool that empowers workers around the world, but they must have the skills to use it. That\u2019s why Microsoft has committed to helping people and communities around the world gain new and necessary AI skills, and this new report contains important recommendations to take the global workforce into the future.\u201d \u2013 Naria Santa Lucia, General Manager, Skills for Social Impact at Microsoft\n\nSAP\n\n\u201cWhat stands out from this research beyond the undeniable needs for responsible AI development and broad AI literacy across all ICT jobs, is the necessity for all roles to enhance their higher-order skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, and complex problem-solving. Beyond the initial adoption of AI, we believe evaluating the second-order effects of these skills shifts will highlight which skills will be commoditized and which will be differentiating in the future.\u201d \u2013 Nicole Helmer, Vice President & Global Head of Development Learning at SAP\n\nResources\n\nAbout Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDespite the growing impact of artificial intelligence in the workplace, most HR leaders aren\u2019t prioritizing the reskilling of workers who may be impacted by AI use, according to a Jan. 7 report from The Conference Board.\n\nIn a survey of 80 CHROs, only 7% said they\u2019re implementing reskilling strategies for job roles with a high probability of at least a quarter of tasks being taken over by AI. Instead, 62% said their top AI priority includes experimentation with pilots and use cases for human capital management functions.\n\n\u201cOrganizations that don\u2019t prioritize upskilling and reskilling their workforce might be caught in a perilous position as the proliferation of AI requires new skills for different roles,\u201d Diana Scott, leader of The Conference Board\u2019s U.S. Human Capital Center, said in a statement. \u201cBut by preparing and reskilling your workforce now, HR leaders will put their companies at a competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nOverall, CHROs remain positive in their outlook on the state of the workforce, remaining stable from mid-2024. Hiring and retention expectations fell during the fourth quarter, but employee engagement expectations increased heading into 2025. About 42% said they expect engagement levels to improve, increasing from 36% who said so in mid-2024.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, 36% of CHROs said they\u2019re advocating for governance policies to mitigate the risks of AI use in the workplace. In addition, 21% said they\u2019re developing and implementing AI literacy programs for the entire workforce, 21% said they\u2019re mitigating concerns about AI by emphasizing potential benefits, and 20% said they\u2019re supporting the creation of new roles to bring AI expertise to the company.\n\nThe demand for AI-related skills has skyrocketed, though perhaps in unexpected ways, according to an O\u2019Reilly report. Employers are prioritizing foundational skills rather than platform-specific skills, with particular interest in prompt engineering, AI principles and broad generative AI knowledge, the report found.\n\nAt the leadership level, more than half of vice presidents and directors said they haven\u2019t received AI training, according to a December report, and only 42% said they feel confident about using AI tools without compromising company data, according to a General Assembly report. A lack of training could negatively affect security, privacy and corporate competitiveness, the firm said.\n\nThe future of work hinges on AI upskilling, according to a report from the AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium, which includes companies such as Google, Indeed, Intel and Microsoft and is led by Cisco. Workers will need upskilling in AI literacy, AI preparedness, data analytics, prompt engineering and AI ethics, they said.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nExperts from IBM Philippines said on Thursday that while artificial intelligence (AI) will not completely replace humans in the workplace, people should improve their skills in light of the rapidly evolving technology.\n\nIBM Philippines technical sales leader Jong Torres said that the rise of generative AI has created new roles that require upgraded skills.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reality that certain tasks that are repeatable, that are very manual in nature, can easily be automated and will be replaced by an AI entity,\u201d said Torres during a workshop.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, with the advent of GenAI (generative AI), there are new roles or new jobs that are created\u2014more premium, shall we say, or more premium when it comes to skills requirements,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSo you want to be in that situation where you become more valuable because you have skills that are quite up to date. It\u2019s a reality that some organizations or some people face, because they get displaced, but when that happens, they also get reskilled to another role.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study by Jobstreet by SEEK last year, 46% of Filipino respondents reported that they use generative AI monthly in their work.\n\nAmong the popular generative AI platforms are ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Watsonx.\n\nIn January, the Federation of Free Workers warned that around 5 million Filipino workers could lose their jobs this year due to AI and climate change.\n\nAccording to FFW, this is based on the projection of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that 14% of the total workforce in the Philippines is at risk of being replaced by AI as well as job losses of 2.3 million due to the effects of typhoons in 2024.\n\n\u201cWill AI replace humans? No,'' said Rjel Lara, IBM Philippines' solutions architect.\n\nLara said humans help to improve AI services.\n\n\"Humans will still have to check if the intelligence system of the AI system performs its task well\u2026and feed that back to the AI so the AI can learn better,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you're still needed.\u201d \u2014 VBL, GMA Integrated News",

        "text": "At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, AI emerged as a central theme, with leaders emphasizing its transformative potential. In an interview at the event with NDTV, Rishad Premji, Executive Chairman of Wipro Ltd, stated that the success of AI adoption is linked to one critical factor: reskilling employees. For C-suite executives and ERP leaders, this insight underscores a strategic imperative\u2014organizations must prioritize reskilling to harness AI\u2019s full potential while ensuring workforce readiness and resilience.\n\nThe reskilling imperative\n\nPremji\u2019s message is clear: AI\u2019s value lies not just in its technological capabilities but in how effectively it is deployed and utilized to solve business problems. Yet, the pace of AI advancement far outstrips the current ability of organizations to adopt it. Bridging this gap requires a dual focus\u2014on technology and people. \u201cThe success and adoption of AI will be tightly coupled with the reskilling agenda we have as companies, as an industry, and as a country,\u201d Premji stated. Reskilling is not merely a reactive measure to address job redundancy; it is a proactive strategy to build an AI-ready workforce capable of driving innovation and operational excellence.\n\nFor ERP and other technology leaders, this means embedding reskilling into the core of their AI strategy. Employees must feel secure about their future, knowing that their skills are aligned with the demands of an AI-driven world. This alignment fosters a culture of change management, where employees become enablers of transformation rather than blockers.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nWipro\u2019s AI-driven transformation\n\nWipro\u2019s approach to AI offers a blueprint for other organizations. Premji revealed that Wipro has made AI \u201call-pervasive\u201d within the company, starting with a comprehensive reskilling initiative. Over the past year, 235,000 employees underwent foundational generative AI training, with 50,000 advancing to higher levels of certification. This structured approach ensures that employees at all levels are equipped with the mindset and skills needed to leverage AI effectively.\n\nWipro\u2019s strategy focuses on three key areas: operational efficiency, enhanced delivery and innovation. For instance, the company is using AI to streamline complex processes, such as distilling 400-page legal documents, into actionable insights. This not only improves efficiency but also frees employees to focus on higher-value tasks. Also, AI is being deployed to optimize project delivery and develop domain-specific use cases that deliver measurable and meaningful business outcomes.\n\nPremji also highlighted the growing potential of agentic AI\u2014a self-learning, autonomous technology capable of adapting to dynamic environments. Unlike traditional AI, agentic AI can self-heal, collaborate with other AI systems and interact with humans through APIs. This represents a significant leap forward, offering businesses the ability to solve complex, real-world problems with unprecedented speed and precision.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nLegacy systems, unstructured data and outdated applications hinder full utilization of AI. ERP and other technology leaders must address these barriers by modernizing their IT ecosystems and ensuring data is well-structured and accessible. As Premji noted, \u201cThere is no AI without data.\u201d Organizations that invest in data architecture and governance will be better positioned to unlock AI\u2019s transformative potential.\n\nReskilling is the cornerstone of any successful AI strategy. Data from an SAPinsider survey shows that 29% of the organizations surveyed still view themselves as slightly behind their competitors, indicating that while some organizations lead in AI adoption, many recognize the need for enhancement or are in the process of advancing their AI integration to keep up with the competition. However, unless business and technology leaders are willing to invest in their employees by giving them the proper training, companies will struggle to see tangible ROI from their investments.\n\nOrganizations must adopt a holistic approach to AI. Senior business and technology leaders must focus their AI strategies on operational efficiency, enhanced delivery and innovation. AI governance is one of the cornerstones of this approach. For instance, Middle East based technology provider e& and IBM announced a strategic partnership at Davos this week offering a multi-model AI and generative AI governance solution to enhance e&\u2019s AI governance framework. This is an example of AI technology providers partnering to address this need. Without a holistic approach and technology that can enable it, organizations\u2019 AI plans may well turn into failed experiments that drive no return.",

        "text": "Two weeks after he told 1,750 employees they were being laid off in the interest of \u201cprioritizing innovation investments like AI,\u201d Carl Eschenbach is not buying the idea that artificial intelligence will replace vast swaths of the workforce.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to destroy jobs at all,\u201d Workday\u2019s CEO says in an interview from its headquarters in Pleasanton, California. \u201cThis is about augmenting humans in the workforce and driving a step function change in human productivity through the use of technology.\u201d\n\nWorkday, a supplier of workforce management software that competes with the likes of SAP and Oracle and carries a near-$70 billion market valuation, has stated its belief that the future of work will be \u201chuman-centric\u201d \u2014 even as it pitches clients that they should bring AI agents into their workforces as \u201cdigital employees\u201d, using the same onboarding process as any new recruit first logging into their HR system.\n\nAD\n\nEschenbach, who remains a venture partner at Sequoia Capital more than two years after moving from a board seat to an executive role at Workday, says his years working with startups taught him \u201cthere\u2019s nothing more important than people.\u201d\n\nHis decision to cut Workday\u2019s own headcount by 8.5% followed similar cuts by other tech companies, including rival Salesforce just days earlier. But it was not about replacing humans with their digital successors, he insists: it was a matter of aligning resources to strategic priorities. Workday needs to step up investment in the technology reshaping every workplace, he says, because there\u2019s an opportunity to provide clients with a \u201csingle platform for all labor, both human and digital.\u201d\n\nWorkday\u2019s workforce\n\nMost restructurings are about cutting costs, and Eschenbach has promised investors in recent earnings calls that Workday will push to expand its profit margins. But he says these cuts were principally about \u201cdriving innovation\u201d and taking advantage of the \u201ctectonic shift\u201d AI represents. By this time next year, he predicts Workday may have more people on its payroll than before the layoffs, but they will be increasingly focused on its AI priorities, and more broadly spread around the world.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to just be smart about where we hire our employees in the future,\u201d Eschenbach says, pointing to markets where human employees typically demand lower salaries than in California. Workday opened offices in Costa Rica not long ago, he notes; it has roughly 2,000 people in Ireland; and in India, it is expanding from Pune into Chennai.\n\nWherever they are based, Eschenbach sees AI \u201cfreeing up\u201d employees from mundane daily tasks, ushering in a new era of productivity in which people\u2019s skills will be more valued than their educational pedigrees. Eschenbach, who captained the wrestling, baseball, and football teams at this northeast Pennsylvania high school, had the chance to attend a four-year college on a wrestling scholarship. Instead, he chose a two-year electronics technician diploma to help launch a career that took him through tech groups like Lucent, Inktomi, and VMware.\n\nTechnology will be critical to \u201creskilling\u201d employees to work more thoughtfully, collaborate better, and improve relationships between managers and their direct reports, he says. \u201cSome people call them soft skills; I think they\u2019re human skills.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOnboarding digital employees\n\nIf digital agents are just a new form of labor, they will need the same level of governance and controls as any employee, Eschenbach argues.\n\n\u201cThink about a human,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we get onboarded, we come into a system, we get registered. Someone says, \u2018What do you have access rights to? What applications are you going to use? What data can you see? How secure are you?\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are no such hoops for AI agents to jump through, he observes. \u201cThey just pop up, they start getting access to data. They\u2019re not secure. They don\u2019t have governance around them\u2026 That creates massive risk.\u201d\n\nIt is a sales pitch as much as a theoretical point: earlier this month, he launched the Workday Agent System of Record, a set of tools to help clients such as Accenture and Amazon Web Services manage their AI agents alongside their human workforce.\n\n\u201cEveryone talks about this agentic world,\u201d he says, but \u201cif you talk to CIOs, CHROs, or CFOs, they\u2019re also nervous about the potential sprawl of agents in the enterprise and not being controlled.\u201d\n\nThe ROI on AI\n\nLike many of his peers, Eschenbach sees companies moving past a period of AI experimentation and committing more serious investment this year. The demand for AI agents among its 10,000-plus enterprise customers is \u201ctremendous,\u201d he says. But his optimism comes with a note of caution.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to quantifying the return on the investment that people have made [in AI], it hasn\u2019t been there as much as people had anticipated,\u201d he says. Companies will still spend, he adds, \u201cbut they\u2019re going to be smarter about the ROI that they can expect. And if they don\u2019t see that, they might not invest as heavily as they once thought they would.\u201d\n\nQuestions about whether Workday\u2019s own investments would drive stronger revenue growth prompted Morgan Stanley analysts this week to lower their price target from $330 to $275. High hopes for AI spending have powered Big Tech valuations since Eschenbach became Workday\u2019s co-CEO in December 2022, but investors are waiting to see stronger returns from companies such as Workday, whose stock is down more than 10% in the year since he took sole charge.\n\nDOGE coin\n\nOne customer clamping down on spending is the US government, where Workday has talked of a potential $2 billion market opportunity if it can update the aging systems federal agencies use to manage their people and budgets. Workday has invested in chasing federal contracts over the past 18 months, winning over the US Department of Energy and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and telling analysts that more than 80% of Washington\u2019s HR management and enterprise systems have yet to move to the cloud.\n\nThe newly created Department of Government Efficiency has set out to slash federal spending, but Eschenbach said he saw no risk to that opportunity from the Elon Musk-fronted group.

And that\u2019s what we can help the government do,\u201d he says. \u201cWe think DOGE can have a positive impact in the future.

        "text": "It is crucial organisations prepare their workforces for artificial intelligence (AI) adoption, according to Maura Jarvis, Workforce Transformation Leader, Mercer UK.\n\nMarsh McLennan hosted \u2018Harnessing the power of AI: Reskilling for growth\u2019, at the AIRMIC Conference 2024, in Edinburgh. Jarvis and James Crask, Head of Strategic Risk Consulting, Marsh Advisory UK, led an engaging session that looked at how organisations can confidently prepare employees for AI use.\n\nAI is a topic firmly at the top of the executive agenda, with AI integration forecasted to add US$20 trillion to global GDP by 2030. Business leaders expect AI to boost performance, help develop talent, allow further collaboration, and be a driver of future growth. However, currently, only 14% of HR leaders think businesses are ready for this transition.\n\nIntegration of AI into the workforce is still in its infancy for most companies. To successfully deliver business results, businesses must have the \u201cagility and ability\u201d to keep pace with the changing work environment, Jarvis said. As the workforce and nature of work transforms through the impact of AI, organisations will need to devise practical strategies for issues they may encounter.\n\nAI opportunities\n\nAI can enhance workplaces to meet productivity needs and financial growth. As organisations pivot and integrate AI into their business processes, leaders are finding \u201copportunities for humans to do more that can add value,\u201d Crask stated.\n\nCurrently, companies are using AI to improve productivity via various methods, including:\n\nAnalysing large amounts of data.\n\nImproving decision-making accuracy.\n\nInnovating and developing new products.\n\nAll organisations have finite resources, such as people, time, and commodities. To provide competitive advantages, harnessing AI is important \u201cfor a lot of organisations to produce growth opportunities,\u201d said Crask.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDespite uncertainty about generative AI developments, 57% of workers globally say they\u2019re ready for reskilling and retraining in new roles to remain ahead in their career, according to a June 13 report from Boston Consulting Group, The Network and The Stepstone Group.\n\nThree-quarters of workers said they believe generative AI will bring some level of disruption to the workplace. At the same time, many remain confident; about 64% said they still hold the upper hand when negotiating for jobs.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a rapid evolution and maturing of employee views toward AI, and a crucial recognition that a commitment to continuous reskilling will ensure long-term employability,\u201d Jens Baier, managing director and senior partner at BCG and leader of the firm\u2019s work in HR excellence, said in a statement.\n\nIn a survey of more than 150,000 workers across 188 countries, many workers appear to be taking a proactive approach to generative AI developments. While job security has surged in importance since 2021 to claim the top spot in worker preferences, learning and career development has increased as well.\n\nWorkers also expressed clear opinions about what they don\u2019t want in the current labor market. About 54% said they would refuse an attractive job offer if they had a negative experience during the interview process. In addition, 40% said they wouldn\u2019t work for a company that doesn\u2019t offer mental health support or that has a perceived negative impact on society.\n\nEarlier this year, Udemy reported a surge in demand for AI, IT and leadership training. Although workers are interested in applying new tech skills, they also want to develop \u201chuman\u201d skills that AI can\u2019t replace, such as active listening and customer service, the report said.\n\nAs employees express interest in upskilling and reskilling, most business leaders are concerned they can\u2019t train workers quickly enough to keep up with AI and tech developments in coming years, according to a World Employment Confederation survey. Leaders in the survey said it\u2019s never been so hard to plan for future talent requirements, especially with flexible workforce needs requiring online talent platforms, more contingent workers and more internal flexibility.\n\nIn fact, about 90% of HR leaders believe up to half their workforces will need to be reskilled in the next five years as AI developments roll out in workplaces, according to a PeopleScout and Spotted Zebra report. To do so effectively, leaders will need to keep employees in mind, communicate their plans for the future, address fears and ensure employees receive the training they need, the report found.",

        "text": "As the UK grapples with economic uncertainty, businesses face mounting pressure to do more with less.\n\nWorkforce expansion and salary increases are stalling, but employees are increasingly turning to digital reskilling to future-proof their careers. Our latest research found that almost four in five (79%) UK employers have seen staff request digital upskilling opportunities over the last twelve months to strengthen their career prospects, particularly in roles linked to emerging technologies like AI and machine learning (ML).\n\nOn our platform, demand for AI-related learning materials is soaring with increases across AI programming (66%), data analysis (59%), and operational AI/ML (54%) learning materials. We\u2019ve also seen an uptick in demand for general AI literacy as IT teams encounter the hallucinations generative AI tools can exhibit.\n\nHowever, given the accelerated integration of generative AI in most enterprises, the need for general AI literacy has extended beyond IT teams. In fact, 60% of enterprises are expected to have adopted generative AI in some form by the end of this year. Yet, while most business leaders agree their workforces need to be reskilled in GenAI, only 10% of workers are currently trained in GenAI tools. Now, non-technical employees are now seeking reskilling opportunities in AI and ML, cybersecurity, data analysis and programming.\n\nThis signals a clear shift across every level and department, with more employees keen to understand how emerging technologies will impact their role and offer growth opportunities. So, how can employers ensure that every employee \u2013 not just IT \u2013 develops the skills to navigate and leverage AI and other digital tools?\n\nBuilding a culture of continuous learning\n\nAdopting new technologies like AI is only part of the equation. Long-term success depends on a sustained commitment to developing a skilled workforce capable of fostering long-term innovation and growth. As more companies begin to experiment with and deploy AI technologies in different settings, employers must prepare every individual to use these tools effectively. Here, a continuous learning approach will ensure that digital transformation benefits the organisation at every level, driving resilience and adaptability within an evolving tech landscape.\n\nOrganisations must embed learning in daily workflows, encouraging curiosity and supporting personalised development. Cross-functional collaboration and knowledge-sharing can help to break down silos, allowing diverse perspectives to be shared amongst teams.\n\nTo foster a culture of continuous learning, HR teams should emphasise to management the elements of \u201cre-recruiting\u201d, to highlight the value of continuously investing in and engaging with talent as consciously as during the hiring process. In turn, this will also underscore the importance of employees continually engaging in their own development and growth.\n\nJoining a company is only the beginning, and sustaining a valuable relationship depends on both the organisation\u2019s support and the employee\u2019s commitment to their own continuous development. To thrive, employees must actively seek out skill-building opportunities and leverage the learning resources available to them. Doing so will help employees remain agile within an evolving technological landscape, while also enhancing their own productivity and contributing to overall organisational success.\n\nProviding real-time learning opportunities\n\nFor employees seeking opportunities for personal growth, to bridge the gap between learning and day-to-day responsibilities, employers can harness the \u2018in the flow of work\u2019 approach to provide staff with real-time access to quality learning content.\n\nThis concept was coined by Josh Bersin to describe a paradigm in which employees learn something new, quickly apply it and return to their work in progress. It\u2019s different from traditional learning approaches like attending a seminar or conference. These learning formats are effective, but many employees simply don\u2019t have the time to devote to them or they prefer to learn at a time that suits them best.\n\nInstead, it entails providing employees with tools that allow them to quickly find contextually relevant answers to their questions at a time that suits their schedule. Companies can offer \u2018in the flow of work\u2019 learning opportunities via an L&D partner to tailor materials to an individual\u2019s unique learning style and objectives.\n\nThis is particularly important not only for young talent who are new to the workforce but also for existing employees who are proactively seeking opportunities to develop their skills and advance their careers. In turn, this approach to workplace learning will increase employee engagement and productivity, fostering innovation and growth that improves the bottom line.\n\nPreparing for the future\n\nIn today\u2019s unpredictable economic climate, reskilling and upskilling efforts are more than just a response to immediate challenges \u2013 they\u2019re a strategic investment in long-term growth. A commitment to continuous learning equips organisations to stay competitive, while empowering employees to navigate technological advancements with confidence.\n\nFor businesses navigating hiring freezes or constrained budgets, prioritising AI literacy and reskilling among their employees in critical areas like cloud computing, data analysis, and cybersecurity can drive innovation and productivity. By supporting these initiatives today, organisations can lay the groundwork for a resilient, future-ready workforce capable of overcoming tomorrow\u2019s challenges.\n\nIn an era define by rapid technological change, continuous learning isn\u2019t just a strategy \u2013 it\u2019s a necessity. Through reskilling, businesses and employees alike can thrive, proving that adaptability and growth are possible even in the toughest times.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAlexia Pedersen is SVP International at O\u2019Reilly.

        "text": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to reshape the software development industry, technology professionals must adapt through reskilling to remain competitive and succeed in the coming years.\n\nProf. Dr. Zafar Nasir, Dean of the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology at DHA Suffa University Karachi, emphasized that AI\u2019s rapid growth has significantly altered the software development landscape. \u201cAI\u2019s monumental growth has brought about a profound change in the software industry,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe global AI market is projected to grow by 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. AI\u2019s role in software development is expected to attract significant investments, driving staffing needs, enabling the creation of highly personalized products, and helping businesses expand their customer bases.\n\nA recent survey revealed that 58% of NYSE-listed companies view AI investment as a key driver for new revenue streams. Furthermore, over 70% of these companies are considering investing in AI for customer service, highlighting a growing interest in AI technologies. As a result, AI is narrowing the gap between industry experts and newcomers, making traditional experience premiums less relevant.\n\nDr. Nasir called for a paradigm shift in workforce reskilling, noting that 25% of jobs will undergo rapid transformations. AI-driven improvements in productivity, such as a 14% boost for customer service agents using Generative AI, illustrate the ongoing shift in workplace dynamics. As job roles evolve, businesses must adopt flexible reskilling strategies to retain skilled talent while transitioning to more specialized, skill-based roles.\n\nRead More: UAE Grants 16,500 Golden Visas to Outstanding Students and Education Specialists\n\nThe Mercer Survey found that 60% of employees prefer working in skill-based organizations, a trend that benefits businesses looking to automate processes with AI-driven applications. Dr. Nasir further explained that AI is automating several aspects of the software development cycle, such as code generation, testing, deployment, and security. This shift allows engineers to focus on higher-level tasks, including system integration, architectural planning, and other creative challenges that drive innovation.\n\nAI-powered training systems are also emerging, offering personalized learning paths that ensure professionals remain up to date with the latest advancements. AI fosters agile, cost-effective strategies that can respond to market dynamics, such as evolving consumer demands and manufacturing processes. Additionally, AI-powered design software can generate multiple optimized designs for a single product.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to transform the dynamics of software development and maximize throughput, especially with AI coding tools that significantly enhance productivity and task completion,\u201d Dr. Nasir stated.\n\nMehboob Shar, a renowned SEO expert and IT coach, and the Founder and CEO of Icreativez Technologies, echoed this sentiment, stating, \u201cAI is accelerating software development. What once took hundreds of hours of programmer time can now be completed in minutes with the right prompts.\u201d At Icreativez Technologies, AI has empowered developers to complete tasks in a single day that previously took weeks, allowing teams to manage multiple projects at once.\n\nTech strategist and National Incubation Centre (NIC) Karachi Project Director Syed Azfar Husain noted that AI is revolutionizing software development by making coding, testing, and deployment faster and more efficient. Tools like GitHub Copilot are helping developers write code more quickly. Additionally, AI has contributed to business successes, such as Netflix optimizing cloud costs and startups like UiPath growing into billion-dollar enterprises through business process automation.\n\nBeyond corporate applications, AI offers exciting prospects for universities to introduce AI-driven courses and research programs. By integrating AI into their operations, businesses can enhance productivity, reduce costs, and foster long-term innovation in an increasingly technology-driven world.\n\nIn Pakistan, software developers have the opportunity to leverage AI by incorporating machine learning and automation into their products, making them more competitive on the global stage. As Pakistan prepares to introduce its first-ever AI Policy in 2025, developers can align with government initiatives for funding, policy support, and regulatory clarity. AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are advancing the development of sophisticated applications, while low-code and no-code tools streamline development cycles.\n\nStartups also have the chance to build AI solutions for local challenges, such as in agriculture, healthcare, and fintech. Collaborating with universities and AI research hubs can further drive innovation.",

        "text": "As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, investing in education and reskilling is critical to ensuring that workers benefit rather than suffer from technological advancements.\n\nThis was the consensus among experts who participated in the latest International Labour Organisation webinar in the AI For Good Series, titled \u2018What Will AI Do to Our Work?\u2019\n\nThe keynote speaker, the Executive Director of Boston University\u2019s Technology and Policy Research Initiatives, James Bessen, challenged widespread fears that AI will cause mass unemployment. Instead, he argued that AI has the potential to improve job quality, create new opportunities, and elevate the value of human-centric skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence.\n\n\u201cAutomation is going to happen more positively when workers are provided with the skills and capabilities to make the most of it,\u201d Bessen stated.\n\nHe emphasised the need to rethink traditional education systems focusing solely on early-life learning, suggesting a shift toward lifelong learning and continuous skill development.\n\n\u201cWe have to change how our educational institutions work to develop lifelong learning. We need to create avenues for workers to develop new skills while integrating emerging technologies into their roles. Additionally, institutions must ensure that acquiring these new skills translates into higher wages and better career opportunities,\u201d he added.\n\nThe discussion, moderated by ILO senior researcher Pawel Gmyrek as part of the AI for Good initiative, explored AI\u2019s evolving impact on the workforce.\n\nRather than simply replacing jobs, AI will transform tasks within existing roles, enabling workers to focus on higher-value activities that require creativity and human judgement. As automation takes over routine tasks, skills like problem-solving, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and communication will become increasingly essential.\n\nIt noted that historically, technological revolutions have caused short-term job disruptions but ultimately led to long-term employment growth and economic progress.\n\nAI is expected to follow a similar path, reshaping industries while creating new opportunities for workers in the evolving job market.\n\nBessen also pointed out potential risks associated with AI adoption, including increased workplace surveillance, privacy concerns, and the potential misuse of automation by employers. However, he insisted that successful AI integration depends on collaboration between employers and workers rather than imposing technology without worker input.\n\n\u201cThe best AI implementations do not antagonise workers\u2014they involve them,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe ILO\u2019s Observatory on Artificial Intelligence and Work in the Digital Economy serves as a leading international knowledge hub on AI\u2019s impact on labour markets. It supports governments and social partners in navigating digital transformation through upskilling programmes, regulatory frameworks, and AI governance strategies aimed at sustainable development.\n\nWith AI evolving at an unprecedented pace, experts agree that proactive investment in education and workforce reskilling will be crucial to unlocking better, higher-paying jobs and ensuring that AI benefits all workers in the modern economy.",

        "text": "Donald H Taylor launches his L&D Global Sentiment Survey and TJ digs into the results\n\nAt the launch event for the of the L&D Global Sentiment Survey 2025, the 12th annual check of the pulse of L&D worldwide, Donald H Taylor has analysed answers from 3,339 people covering 93 countries.\n\nDon asks \u201cWhat will be hot in workplace L&D?\u201d for the coming year and people make a selection from 16 options, including AI, reskilling, learning analytics and others.\n\nDon highlights some of the key findings, including:\n\nAI dominates. Again.\n\n\n\nData holds on to the top 5\n\n\n\nValue is BACK\n\n\n\nThe year\u2019s challenge: strategy, skills and resources\n\nArtificial intelligence #1\n\nThere\u2019s a huge gap between first place, AI, and second place, reskilling/upskilling. AI has still increased in votes compared to last year, and reskilling/upskilling has had a major decrease compared to 2024. If AI is so prevalent, strong and intertwined with everything we do and, for many, becoming business as usual, does it warrant a place on the list for 2026? Egle Vinauskaite commented, \u201cThere is AI for upskilling/reskilling and upskilling/reskilling because of AI.\u201d\n\nLaura Overton added, \u201cIn the 1980\u2019s we might have said is the personal computer going to be hot in learning. In the 1990\u2019s the question might have been is the internet going to be hot. AI is the same now, it covers all!\u201d\n\nDon shared that the US votes for AI in the survey have usually led trends, and for AI this has been the case since 2021. However the votes are down 4% this year \u2013 so where have those votes been placed instead.\n\nValue trio\n\nConsulting more deeply with the business, showing value and performance support are what Don called the \u201cvalue trio\u201d. Where most items on the list have moved down, these three have moved from stagnation to rising for 2025. \u201cWith AI absorbing so many votes, every other option on the table fell, so this recovery by the value trio is significant.\u201d\n\nLaura Overton commented, \u201cAt last VALUE is back! I\u2019m not surprised \u2013 but is it due to lots of concern about being seen to add value or excitement about opportunity to add more value?\u201d With such a change to our working landscape that AI has forced, is this us questioning our own value within the organisation, to keep our jobs and departments, or actually focusing forward on performance improvement?\n\nSome comments at the launch event were that the value trio are foundational within organisations and that\u2019s why there has been a refocus, especially if AI is becoming more useful and saving resource across L&D and the business more widely and in a context of uncertainty it can provide some certainty. Some referenced the World Economic Forum report and that focusing on skills and job longevity might be coming top of mind again for wider stakeholders.\n\nRecord year for challenges\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an entire book of people\u2019s misery, despair and challenges\u201d from the survey, shared Don, of the near-30,000 words that people contributed.\n\nComments that fell into the category of \u2018resources, budget, workload\u2019, such as \u201cdo more with less\u201d, has gradually increased in the last three years. The category of \u2018strategy, skills, talent\u2019 had gown down 2022-2023, not surprising with the focus on technology in 2024 due to AI. However this year it\u2019s the number one category of concern for people. People in the leisure, retail and childcare services also discussed how findings like these can help teams support workers that aren\u2019t at desks and aren\u2019t able to spend time at a computer within an eight-hour shift.\n\nSome concerns are reducing. Content has stagnated over the last four years, though one could wonder if it would change when considering the use of AI for content creation. Read more on trusting AI results. The concern about delivery is similar to last year, but concerns that fall into the category of people (talking about learners, employees, helping serving people), has dropped for the fourth year in a row. Was 2022 a spike because of people focusing on Covid-related issues? Is there more of a focus on people self-serving their learning, especially if companies have experiential/learning management systems that are personalising learning and resources much more?\n\nThe CEO doesn\u2019t get excited by AI, they get excited by what it can do for the organisation\n\nAt the event the challenges were discussed about whether the data in the report was reflective of the reality in the room. One person made a great point about the headline finding of the report, \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t AI, what would we be talking about?\u201d There were some that felt AI was part of normal work now, whilst others commented that people didn\u2019t know what AI really meant for their organisation, what to do with it and needed stability before investing in it. After all, one person contributed, the CEO doesn\u2019t get excited by AI, they get excited by what it can do for the organisation. This shouldn\u2019t be about what we are doing with AI in L&D, but about how we are supporting change in the whole organisation.\n\nSumming up, Don stated: \u201cThe point of the survey and the report is always to promote discussion\u201d and it certainly did on this launch day.\n\nJo Cook is Editor of Training Journal and virtual classroom specialist at her company Lightbulb Moment",

        "text": "Despite widespread excitement and substantial investments in generative artificial intelligence over the past year, many legal departments haven\u2019t enjoyed the returns they expected. This discrepancy has led some leaders to question whether generative AI is the game-changer it was touted to be.\n\nGenerative AI is transformative, but some early adopters are making a critical error: They lack a comprehensive reskilling strategy. To unlock AI\u2019s full potential, legal departments can\u2019t skip this important step.\n\nReskilling\u2019s Importance\n\nMany legal departments rushed to create or acquire expensive generative AI tools without first preparing their workforce, leading to underused technologies and unmet expectations. Employees who are unfamiliar with generative AI and its capabilities may resist these tools, resulting in poor integration and minimal impact on productivity.\n\nDespite the allure of AI and the expectation of immediate improvements in efficiency, the rush to integrate these tools often overlooks the human factor. Without a thorough understanding and buy-in from the workforce, even the most advanced AI systems fall short of their potential.\n\nReskilling is now recognized as a strategic imperative for organizations aiming to harness generative AI effectively. Reskilling initiatives are becoming mainstream, with 56% of surveyed organizations actively implementing these programs, according to Harvard Business Review. The article also stated that \u201creskilling has emerged as an essential strategy for companies aiming to secure a competitive advantage by cultivating unique talent and addressing critical skill shortages.\u201d Despite this call to action, the challenge remains for how to effectively engage employees and align reskilling efforts with business goals.\n\nFor reskilling to be truly effective, it must be aligned with the broader strategic objectives of the organization. This alignment ensures that the skills being developed among employees are directly applicable to the tasks and challenges they will face.\n\nIn the context of the legal industry, this means identifying the specific ways in which generative AI can enhance legal practices and tailoring reskilling programs to support these applications. Reskilling programs should focus on training employees to use these tools proficiently, understanding both their technical functionalities and practical applications in daily legal work.\n\nPractical Steps\n\nStart small with simple tools. Begin with easy-to-use, inexpensive generative AI tools that allow employees to explore and experiment. Custom GPTs are an excellent starting point for this exploration.\n\nEncourage experimentation. Provide employees with the freedom to create \u201cthrowaway GPTs\u201d for specific projects. These temporary tools can help employees identify useful applications of AI in their daily tasks without the pressure of permanent implementation.\n\nPilot with an early adoption group. Start with a small early adoption group to pilot the program. Identify the most eager members of the group and have them be the first to go through the reskilling process. Their enthusiasm and productivity gains can motivate others to integrate AI seamlessly into their everyday work and processes.\n\nExpand AI tools across the organization. Once the legal team is reskilled and using their custom GPTs effectively, they can identify which tools might benefit the rest of the organization.\n\nConsider making these tools available through instant messaging platforms for broader use. Examples include FAQ policy generative AI assistants to reduce repetitive inquiries, simple non-disclosure agreement creators, and a training enablement guide GPT for better understanding of contracting processes.\n\nSimple Use Cases. Introducing employees to generative AI through simple starter use cases can significantly enhance their comfort and proficiency with the technology. This allows them to augment their skills and see immediate benefits without feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes, there are obvious use cases that are missed.\n\nFor instance, during a client meeting, a legal professional declined a personal writing assistant, claiming she couldn\u2019t think of how she would use it. However, just before we ended the call, she mentioned that she had more than 10 performance evaluations to complete and was dreading it. We pointed out that a personal writing assistant could make this task less painful and set it up.\n\nHere are some other proven, practical use cases for generative AI integration tailored for legal professionals:\n\nBrainstorming on meeting planning. Generate ideas and agendas for meetings, ensuring all relevant points are covered.\n\nSummarizing benchmarking reports. Highlight key insights and metrics.\n\nExtracting key terms from contracts. Identify and extract important terms and clauses from contracts, making it easier to review and manage legal documents.\n\nAutomating FAQs on policies and procedures. Create and manage FAQ sections for company policies and procedures, reducing repetitive inquiries and freeing up time for staff.\n\nDrafting objectives and key results. Help draft clear and achievable OKRs by analyzing company goals and performance data.\n\nStarting with simple projects enable employees to gradually build their skills and confidence, paving the way for more sophisticated integrations in the future, such as more complex contract creation, invoice review, and using assistants to refine legal arguments during litigation preparation.\n\nGenerative AI\u2019s potential to revolutionize industries is undeniable, but realizing it requires a strategic approach.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nManufacturers across the U.S. are leaning into artificial intelligence as a pivotal aspect of business growth. It\u2019s not surprising then that 87% of those surveyed in a Deloitte report on AI in manufacturing have adopted the technology or plan to do so in the next two years.\n\nHowever, a key challenge to implementing AI is training a workforce to leverage the technology, especially factory-level employees. A 2023 Boston Consulting Group study found that only 14% of frontline workers say they have received AI upskilling, compared to 44% of leaders.\n\n\u201cWhile approximately 70% of the current US workforce is concentrated in frontline roles that are seeing an increase in the demand for AI proficiency, AI skilling offerings to date have been almost exclusively geared toward non-frontline populations including roles like data scientists, executives, and engineers,\u201d said Matthew Daniel, senior principal for talent strategy at Guild, a workforce training organization.\n\nAs more manufacturers navigate upskilling workers to use AI in everything from R&D to assembly and maintenance needs on the factory floor, here\u2019s how some companies are tackling the workforce training challenge.\n\nOnline programs can offer workers flexible training\n\nOffering training that can help workers upskill to leverage AI in their daily functions is a key way companies can ease anxieties in workers around the technology replacing their jobs, Daniel said. Doing so could be key for companies, as 36% of respondents in BCG\u2019s study believe their job could be eliminated by AI.\n\n\u201cOrganizations should proactively create avenues for employees to upskill with AI and reframe the narrative to not fear AI and the unknown but to showcase what's possible \u2014 their workforce leading, adapting, and adding unprecedented value.\u201d\n\nWorkforce training organization Guild offers bundled AI training programs focused on related topics, such as AI literacy and ethics, workplace applications, technical programming and executing AI-driven strategies.\n\nThe programs are fully online and offer a flexible schedule so frontline workers can participate without disrupting work. Online training options that fit into the workflow of employees can make the process easier for individuals to tackle.\n\n\u201cIt's not just about adapting to AI \u2014 it's about empowering the frontline workforce to thrive alongside it and giving them the tools and resources to do so,\u201d Daniel said.\n\nLeveraging digital tools to upskill workers\n\nUpskilling is important for workers that may not be familiar with AI or other digital tools, said Bill Rokos, chief technology officer at Parsec Automation Corp., an organization working with more than 11,000 manufacturing companies to integrate AI into their workflows.\n\n\u201cFor many floor workers, powerful tools like the Internet of Things, automation and digitalization are brand-new concepts,\u201d Rokos said.\n\nAugmented reality, virtual reality and other digital resources can offer helpful simulation platforms for workers to practice these new skills.\n\n\u201cUsing augmented reality and virtual reality, manufacturing leaders can provide workers with on-the-job training and enable them to learn new skills in a safe and controlled environment,\u201d Rokos said.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what digital solutions firm UST is doing. The company is using the metaverse as a virtual training environment with gamified learning to teach how to use AI for tasks like data analysis, predictive maintenance, quality control and optimization.\n\n\u201cWe simulate real-world scenarios and problem statements in a virtual world and get workers to solve complex problems with a higher level of retention due to experiential learning,\u201d said Ramya Kannan, vice president and industry head of manufacturing at UST. \u201cThe metaverse provides an interactive and immersive learning experience.\u201d\n\nThis kind of learning also allows for easy collaboration and real-time communication between multiple workers and trainers.\n\n\u201cWe can share feedback, add learnings from mistakes back into the training program and constantly improve the experience,\u201d Kannan said.\n\nManufacturers are also using \u201cAI-powered predictive maintenance, which analyzes equipment sensor data to forecast maintenance needs to reduce operational downtime, improve equipment reliability, and enhance worker productivity,\u201d Rokos said.\n\nMany of these training programs, whether online or in-person, focus on safety and control, ensuring workers know how to protect company data as operations become more connected, according to a recent report from the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\n\u201dThe most effective AI models are humancentered, allowing them to learn and unlearn, continuously improving to meet the needs of their human operators,\u201d the report said.",

        "text": "According to Accenture's AI-Driven Economic Growth in India report, intelligent machines and humans working together are expected to raise India\u2019s annual growth rate by 1.3 percentage points by 2035. This translates to an additional $957 billion, or 15% of the gross value added, to India\u2019s economy.\n\nHowever, the skill gap remains a significant barrier. According to IBM\u2019s Augmented Work for an automated, AI-driven world report, 40% of the workforce needs to reskill to keep pace with AI adoption over the next three years. Considering this situation, organisations must devise a reskilling plan to equip their workforce to harness the potential benefits of AI and use new-age technologies effectively.\n\nUpskilling is a cultural shift, not just technical training\n\nShefali Sharma Garg, VP- People Success, Publicis Sapient, emphasizes that reskilling requires cultivating learnability as a core competency. She rightly points out that reskilling beyond technical training demands a cultural shift toward continuous learning and adaptability in an AI-driven economy.\n\n\u201cLeveraging AI-powered tools like chatbot assistants, we simplify access to a diverse ecosystem of learning resources. These tools can empower individuals to design personalised learning journeys tailored to their unique career aspirations. Curated learning boards further enhance this experience by providing clear, step-by-step guidance for building relevant skills,\u201d Shefali notes.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nTech Mahindra\u2019s CPO Richard Lobo shares key HR strategies for 2025\n\nAI, skills, and well-being to define workplaces in 2025\n\nSimilarly, Rekha Alagappan, Country HR Manager, SBM Offshore India, calls for implementing workforce reskilling strategies as essential to maintain competitiveness. She suggests initiatives like internal hackathons to inspire team members to explore how AI can improve productivity, streamline tasks, and create practical solutions for the organization. \u201cThis includes the introduction of business chatbot use cases for effortless and accurate Q&A, automating data entry through data and deliverable automation, and using AI-powered document verification (AI data check) to simplify document comparison and verification processes,\u201d Rekha explains.\n\nFocus on soft skills\n\nSheenam Ohrie, Managing Director, Broadridge, India, highlights that alongside technical expertise, soft skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence will remain crucial.\n\nProblem Solving and Critical Thinking: As automation takes over routine tasks, the ability to break down existing complex business processes will be in high demand.\n\nEmotional Intelligence: Jobs requiring empathy, relationship-building, and nuanced human interaction will become more important.\n\nCollaboration with Technology: Developing the skills to effectively work alongside AI systems and optimize their capabilities will be a key competency.\n\n\u201cTo thrive in 2025 and beyond, embracing the challenge of reskilling will empower us to shape a future where humans and AI technologies work together to achieve unprecedented success. Hence, building a culture of continuous learning, customised training programs, public-private partnerships, and mentorship and coaching are strategies to be considered,\u201d adds Sheenam.\n\nHow to lead the change\n\nThe skill gap between current abilities and future requirements is increasingly widening, and without action, organisations are at risk of not being relevant to stakeholder needs.\n\nSunil Yadav, Distinguished Engineer, Dell Technologies, highlights the importance of skill gap analysis to understand where the workforce stands and what the future demands. \u201cOrganisations should assess current skills, identify evolving needs, and outline clear development paths to prepare employees for upcoming opportunities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sunil, fostering a growth mindset and communicating with the team is a must. \u201cChange often comes with resistance, but a growth mindset helps employees adapt and embrace transformation. Also, leadership must communicate a clear vision of how reskilling will benefit the organisation and its people, using all available internal platforms to amplify the message.\u201d\n\nPersonalised development strategies, and aligning learning opportunities with team members\u2019 interests and skill levels through mentoring, coaching, and tailored training ensure meaningful progress, Sunil suggests.\n\nTo address the skill gap in an AI-driven economy, it becomes imperative for organisations to champion a culture of continuous learning and upskilling, and if employees want to remain competitive in a strong market, skill-building and training will need to take center stage. \u201cInnovative learning programs, curated learning experiences, and nurturing curiosity are the need of the hour,\u201d says Rajasekar Rajagopal, Assurance Leader \u2013 EY Global Delivery Services.\n\nFor Rajasekar, upskilling isn\u2019t just a strategic move, it's a human one. \u201cIt's about investing in our people, showing them,they're appreciated, and ensuring that our workforce evolves alongside the technological landscape, keeping us all moving forward together.\u201d\n\nTo succeed in the AI-driven economy of 2025, organisations must embrace a holistic approach to reskilling and upskilling their workforce, combining technical expertise with strategic thinking and adaptability. Partha Sengupta, Managing Director and India GCC Head, Nielsen, believes in fostering a culture of continuous learning where teams are well-versed in AI technologies like deep learning, and generative AI to enhance content analysis and predictive modelling.\n\nSengupta suggests, leveraging AI-driven platforms to identify skill gaps, tailor training journeys, and track progress ensures effective learning outcomes. \u201cPartnerships with academic and industry leaders enrich our training programs, ensuring access to cutting-edge knowledge and certifications. Furthermore, our reskilling initiatives underscore ethical AI principles such as transparency and bias mitigation, enabling employees to implement AI responsibly.\u201d\n\nThe skill gap is widening, but organisations that act now can turn this challenge into an opportunity. Building a culture of continuous learning, leveraging AI-driven tools, and investing in both technical and soft skills are the keys to thriving in the AI-driven economy of 2025 and beyond.",

NTT DATA's GenAI report finds that 84 per cent of C-suite executives in India anticipate major transformations in 2025 due to the emphasis on GenAI integration.\n\n\"Over the year, AI's rapid integration across industries has created unparalleled opportunities, but it also exposed critical gaps in workforce readiness. The adoption of AI \u2013 from healthcare to logistics \u2013 demands a workforce equipped with technical expertise in machine learning, data analytics, and ethical AI practices but also with creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability to complement AI-driven automation,\" said Kunal Walia, Partner at Dalberg Advisors.\n\n\n\n\"Addressing these gaps requires collective action. It has been promising to witness the government of India taking proactive measures to foster an AI-skilled population. However, skilling initiatives must extend beyond technical training. There must also be an emphasis on enabling individuals to adapt to the evolving demands of AI-driven ecosystems,\" said Walia.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, collaboration between the government, industry, and academia will be pivotal. Initiatives such as AI-focused curriculums, public-private partnerships for skill-building, and accessible upskilling programs for workers in traditional industries are essential to bridge the skills gap. \"India stands at the cusp of becoming a global AI powerhouse, but achieving this vision requires a forward-looking ecosystem, by empowering individuals to harness AI's potential, we can drive inclusive growth in the age of automation,\" added Walia.\n\nAccording to NTT DATA's GenAI report, 96 per cent of the respondents globally believe that GenAI can streamline workflows and redefine employee experiences, while 100 per cent of Indian respondents have similar thoughts. However, they face challenges related to workforce skills, given the lack GenAI expertise by employees. This will give rise to several training initiatives in 2025 that will include focused programs to address the skill gaps in enabling smoother adoption of GenAI.\n\n\"GenAI will have a long-term impact, addressing challenges and fostering responsible innovation to drive measurable results and societal advancement. As we enter 2025, companies and leaders globally have well-defined strategies to leverage the true potential of GenAI. This is particularly crucial for India, which has ambitious dreams to accomplish in this decade. The New Year will see companies ensuring GenAI integration to facilitate India's ambitious missions of Digital India and Atmanirbhar Bharat while serving consumers with the best products and solutions. The future of GenAI in India seems quite promising,\" said Avinash Joshi, CEO, India, NTT DATA Inc.\n\nThe rise of AI is not just about job creation but also the transformation of existing roles. \"AI isn't just about replacing repetitive tasks; it's helping people work smarter and driving innovation across industries like healthcare, education, and manufacturing. This shift is creating exciting opportunities but also a clear need for workers to learn new skills. To make the most of these changes, we need to focus on reskilling and upskilling. It's important to ensure that anyone who is either starting their careers or in mid-level roles, are ready for the jobs of the future. India has a huge talent pool, and if we equip them with the right skills, we can become leaders in the AI-driven world,\" said Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital.",

        "text": "Tapping into the seemingly endless possibilities that generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) represents requires organizations to think bigger than simply rolling out new tools. Truly sustainable gen AI implementation begins with a holistic strategy \u2014 one that puts humans at the centre and supports them through the upskilling and reskilling needed to make the most of these emerging technologies.\n\nIn 2023, gen AI proved to be one of the most rapidly adopted technologies the world has ever seen. It holds the potential to increase productivity, create economic impact, transform work, improve data governance and reshape workforce. Looking forward, more and more organizations will be seeking ways to unleash those upsides in pursuit of a competitive edge. What does that business case look like?\n\nBy the numbers, some estimates show as much as 7% of current US employment could ultimately be substituted by AI, while a further 63% could be complemented by it.\u00b9 In Canada and around the world, workforces will need to work with, and alongside, gen AI for businesses and organizations to maximize its capabilities. Doing so will require a meaningful shift in how we structure, organize, guide and carry out work; a shift layered with implications, including organizational culture and operating models.\n\nAt EY, we\u2019ve found that focusing on a core set of human factors can increase the probability of business transformation success to more than 70%. Putting humans at the centre of gen AI implementation necessitates a strategy that considers what values, behaviours and leadership styles will be needed to create an environment that\u2019s receptive to adopting this technology and transforming in this way. With this insight, you\u2019ll start to see ways the organizational structure must evolve for gen AI to really take off internally.\n\nFirst things first: effectively optimizing operating models and organizational structures will mean clarifying how specific roles and responsibilities will evolve in light of gen AI adoption. This shift will also require governance to evolve accordingly; you\u2019ll need the right oversight and expertise to manage potential risks or emerging threats posed by gen AI. All of these considerations will have implications for \u2014 and require engagement from \u2014 your people.\n\nTech tools make the greatest positive impact when people are empowered and trained to think about and to use them effectively. That\u2019s especially true for gen AI, which will feel entirely new to much of the workforce. This technology represents a host of new opportunities and risks that must be considered in everyday use. Your people will need new skills that allow them to work iteratively in this transformational work pattern.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Working with gen AI will also require a range of soft skills, fresh thinking and an inherent openness to continuous innovation. This could present an opportunity to refresh talent management overall through this lens, including a much tighter alignment of the new skills leaders and employees will need and the learning they receive.\n\nSome of these skills include tactical capabilities: for instance, prompt engineering to ensure you\u2019re getting the most accurate and impactful results from gen AI queries. Bias detection and handline will also be important. Employees will need to be able to spot biases that may exist, especially when the system is learning. While additional measures will be in place to manage risk, your people need to understand how to identify and address risk occurring in the results.\n\nMoreover, your team must adopt a mindset rooted in flexibility and continuous learning to effectively engage with gen AI. This involves a readiness to adapt to evolving circumstances and swiftly acquire new skills. Employees should possess critical thinking skills to assess gen AI responses, emotional intelligence to understand the human context in applying those responses, a collaborative approach with the technology and, most important, resilience. Working with gen AI may yield results that don't perfectly align with expectations, and in such cases your workforce should respond with resilience \u2014 learning from experiences, iterating and improving their approach for better outcomes in the future.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to double down anywhere, focus on that learning element now. To embed that people-first learning focus at the heart of your gen AI implementation strategy, start by asking key questions now. Doing so will surface critical insight about where your organization stands on the learning and development journey now, and gaps you can close through a strategic refresh.\n\nWhat questions should you consider as part of this process?\n\n1. How will roles and skills evolve as we implement gen AI? A current and future state assessment helps clarify new tasks that will emerge as gen AI rolls out, outline related performance metrics and scope the skillsets employees will need to effectively work alongside gen AI. From there, you can build programming strategically.\n\n2. Where are the biggest skill gaps in our current workforce? It\u2019s critical to laser-focus learning budgets and investments on the areas that will require the most upskilling and reskilling. By mapping out the skills your people have, and the skills your workforce is missing to capitalize on gen AI, you can make learning plans targeted and impactful now and into the future.\n\n3. Do we have clear learning pathways to move our people forward? Organizations \u2014 and the people who bring them to life \u2014 need learning to make meaningful progress and understand where they\u2019re headed. When people feel their learning pathway is deliberate and strategic, they\u2019re more likely to stay engaged and invest in a future they can be excited about; including one that incorporates gen AI.\n\n4. How will leaders need to adapt their coaching styles? As employees build capabilities and confidence to work with gen AI and achieve results, the leadership supporting them must evolve, too. In this new paradigm, leaders have to adapt the way they lead, pay more attention to key areas and engage with people in different ways than they have in the past. Identifying those necessary shifts now can help further identify associated learning and development programs that proactively bolster these skillsets, strategies and styles.\n\n5. Are we ready to shift away from process management? Gen AI will also bring new focus areas to the workforce. These could include engineering prompts and writing good questions that gen AI tools can effectively work, using gen AI data to shape better-quality outputs, advice and decisions, and drawing on gen AI\u2019s analytics and creative results to design a better end product. All of these new focus areas will be relevant and important as gen AI gains traction across the organization. Employees and leaders alike will need training to understand these new areas and tackle them effectively in the course of their daily work.\n\nWhat\u2019s the bottom line?\n\nAnyone who\u2019s gone through transformation before will likely know the importance of prioritizing people at the heart of the strategy. That said, gen AI is unique in terms of the risks it brings, the massive potential for productivity gains and the breadth of impact expected to touch two out of three people. These nuances require organizations to embrace this transformation thoughtfully. Start by experimenting in a safe way that considers all risks, conducting a change impact analysis and then using that intel as your foundation to start upskilling people and leaders today.",

        "text": "While worker enthusiasm for life-long learning is growing in an AI-driven world, employers aren't meeting the moment with the right upskilling opportunities and training\n\nLISLE, Ill., Aug. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, DeVry University released its second annual report on upskilling and reskilling the U.S. workforce in the age of AI. In partnership with Reputation Leaders, the research reveals that while employees are more enthusiastic about opportunities for ongoing learning, current employer upskilling and reskilling efforts are not meeting the moment with the right opportunities to reach, engage and train all employees. This can lead to greater organizational and talent risk.\n\n\"Our research provides critical insights into how employers and employees are adapting to this fast-paced change.\" Post this DeVry University Releases \u201cClosing the Gap: Upskilling and Reskilling in an AI Era,\u201d its Report on Learning and Development in the U.S. Workforce\n\nThe report, Closing the Gap: Upskilling and Reskilling in an AI Era, surveyed more than 1,500 employees and 580 hiring decision-makers across sectors to uncover gaps and opportunities for upskilling in this rapidly evolving landscape.\n\n\"Generative AI and high-volume data analytics are fundamentally transforming how we learn and work, leading to significant disruption in the job market. While some roles are vanishing, many are quickly evolving in ways we've never seen before,\" said Elise Awwad, president and CEO of DeVry University. \"This swift evolution underscores the urgency for upskilling and reskilling to meet rising expectations, while also preparing for the emergence of entirely new roles and career paths. Our research provides critical insights into how both employers and employees are adapting to this fast-paced change, highlighting what can be done better to meet future demands.\"\n\nThe research uncovered four key insights about the challenges of upskilling and reskilling in an AI-driven world:\n\nWorkers Have More Access, Time and Energy for Upskilling\u2014But Still Aren't Taking Action\n\nWhile more workers say they face no barriers to upskilling (30% in 2024 vs. 22% in 2023), employers estimate only about half (55%) of workers participate in upskilling opportunities available at work. Nearly 9 in 10 employers (87%) say they offer upskilling. This represents a slight increase compared to last year's study (78%) in both availability of upskilling and utilization of programs, but across industries, the survey still found a substantial gap between what workers and employers say versus what they do.\n\nWorkers Believe in Their Current AI Skills More Than Their Employers Do\n\nWorkers and employers both acknowledge the ubiquity of AI and the importance of embracing skills in this new technology as an essential component of the near-future workplace. Yet, employers are underestimating the AI fluency of their current workers. According to the survey, employers say that 32% of their workers are merely novices at AI; however, workers feel far more strongly about their skill sets with only 3% describing themselves as such.\n\nWomen Are Falling Behind When It Comes To AI\n\nAmid growing access to and deployment of AI tools, women are falling behind men in uptake of skills and use of AI tools. Only 41% describe their AI proficiency as intermediate or higher, in comparison to 55% of men. And, while 43% of men regard AI as a way to help them get ahead, only 27% of women agree. Women see less value in the adoption of AI in comparison to men on every measure, with only 49% seeing the benefits of AI as making their work easier in comparison to 58% of men.\n\nCurrent Upskilling Approaches\u2014Including in AI\u2014May Expose Companies to Long-Term Risk\n\nThe data raises ethical questions about the choices employers make in providing access to AI training and skills development. Seventy-two percent of employers say they do not provide upskilling benefits to all workers, and 42% of employers say they are not confident that their organization understands how to train workers on AI effectively. When more than half of workers (56%) say they are using AI tools at work at least weekly, many are doing so without training and without guardrails for any ethical or security considerations.\n\n\"Inequitable access to AI learning and resources and use of AI tools in the workplace without guardrails, threaten to create new and avoidable organizational risks. The solution is integrated planning for the use of AI and holistic training that prepares all workers for seamless deployment of the new technology. At DeVry, we believe intentional education of employees and the broader U.S. workforce around AI is imperative for companies and organizations to successfully navigate an increasingly technology-focused marketplace,\" commented Awwad.\n\nAbout the Survey\n\nDeVry University engaged Reputation Leaders, an independent research firm to conduct research from June 11-26, 2024, about artificial intelligence (AI) in connection to upskilling and reskilling.

        "text": "Today\u2019s organizations must contend with an everchanging technological, economic, environmental, and societal landscape. The workforce is particularly vulnerable to recent disruptions that have been heightened by the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and other automation technologies such as robotic process automation. New technologies will transform an estimated 1.1 billion jobs over the next decade alone.1 Given this ever-evolving environment, organizations will need to design and implement a robust, innovative upskilling and reskilling workforce strategy\u2014one that is both adaptable enough to capitalize on present opportunities around automation and flexible enough to adjust to future advancements.\n\nTo remain competitive, organizations will need to be agile and future state-oriented. One key way to achieve that is by embracing AI as a tool to leapfrog traditional workforce learning challenges. This can involve focusing on creating a culture of learning and identifying opportunities for employees to learn new skills through microlearnings, externships, project opportunities, and assignments. As organizations begin to reimagine the future of workforce upskilling and reskilling, pulling some or all of these levers can help them create a resilient workforce that propels their mission forward.\n\nFigure 1. Guidehouse's Upskilling and Reskilling Approach\n\nThe accelerator: AI-Powered workforce development\n\nAI and automation technologies represent innovative opportunities for organizations across all sectors to identify skills gaps and enable learning opportunities. AI skills inference and natural language processing can improve understanding of the skills needed by organizations and how to address them. This can take the form of an assessment that extrapolates skills gaps from existing data.2 Using AI to analyze employee career history, performance feedback, and skillsets presents another way to yield learning recommendations tailored to each worker to upskill or address skills gaps.3\n\nAs technology increasingly automates tasks, workers must be willing to learn new skills through retraining to stay valuable to their organizations\u2014and leaders need to help them along that journey.4,5 AI provides a valuable opportunity to compile and analyze data so that leaders can use the output to create a targeted, data-informed approach to upskilling and reskilling.\n\nThe foundation: creating and sustaining a learning culture\n\nTo capitalize on and stay ahead of technological advancements, organizations must create a purposeful culture of learning. Changing norms offer the potential for growth\u2014both to organizations and employees themselves\u2014but only if organizations invest in necessary training as technology and business requirements change. While initial investments in reskilling may be viewed as costly, organizations that strategically reskill at least a quarter of their workforce in tandem with implementing a learning culture are more likely to profit financially in the long term.6 They also benefit by improving the quality of their workforce through employee and institutional knowledge retention.\n\nThe enabler: Creating experiential learning\n\nEnabling experiential learning opportunities such as internships and apprenticeships gives employees the chance to grow while providing organizations with potential tax advantages and better employee retention.7 Organizations can help employees learn skills that are applicable to their daily job performance by facilitating learning opportunities such as externship programs, internal apprenticeships, and peer mentorships. Bite-sized microlearnings can also be integrated throughout an employee\u2019s workday.\n\nWhile organizations can strategically outsource learning to stay on top of recent advancements, they will need to carefully evaluate and curate their options to ensure that any investments are cost-effective and aligned with their business culture and priorities.\n\nInvesting in upskilling and reskilling\n\nIn a rapidly changing environment, one thing is clear: organizations must invest in upskilling and reskilling. Fortunately, they can turn to Guidehouse as a trusted partner for help with navigating this increasingly complex, everchanging landscape.\n\nAs a leader in this area of expertise, we design, build, and implement future-state workforce readiness support solutions for clients across industries and sectors. When an organization\u2019s workforce lacks the skills or talent required to remain competitive, we develop an upskilling and reskilling approach tailored to its unique needs. To achieve that we employ a combination of resources, tools, and techniques, including human capital strategy and operations subject matter experts, industry and market benchmarking, culture assessments, and data analytics and visualization methods.\n\nLearn more about our expertise and approach to optimizing an adaptable workforce.",

        "text": "Technology is changing the way we work, we live, we interact and at the heart of this transformation lies Artificial Intelligence. AI has added wings to the workforce which has accelerated output and streamlined operations, making tasks faster and more accurate. The conversation around AI, automation, and GenAI often highlights concerns about job displacement, but it\u2019s essential to view this shift through a broader lens.\n\nJob losses have long been a byproduct of technological evolution. The Industrial Revolution led to the displacement of many workers from agriculture, but it also created new jobs in manufacturing and transportation. Similarly, the rise of computers and the internet led to the decline of certain professions, but it also gave birth to entirely new industries and job roles.\n\nBank tellers were replaced by ATMs, switchboard operators by automated systems, and lift operators by automated elevators. Today, we are witnessing a similar shift as well where AI is taking over significant portions of jobs in manufacturing, customer service, and data entry and processing, among others. AI, with its ability to automate repetitive tasks, is reshaping industries and forcing entire sectors to adapt.\n\n\u201cWith the advent of AI, over half of the skills that people use on a daily basis at work will need to be revised. Hence, the employees who are skilled in AI might pose a threat to those who are not,\u201d says Sandeep Agarwal, MD & Global CTO of Visionet.\n\nHowever, historically, while technological advancements may initially displace jobs, they also create new roles that often require different skills. This trend emphasises the critical need for workers to reskill and upskill to remain relevant in an evolving job landscape. Industries are already witnessing the emergence of new positions centred around AI management, data analysis, and technology integration, which demand a different set of competencies.\n\n\u201cWhile certain tasks and roles may be automated, this technology transformation creates new avenues for innovation and employment,\u201d says Kapil Mahajan, Global CIO, Allcargo Logistics. He further adds that the key lies in adaptability. Many jobs that will be automated are repetitive or transactional in nature, but there will be an increasing demand for roles in AI development, deployment, and oversight.\n\nA study by ServiceNow and Pearson shows that AI and automation will require 16.2 million workers in India to reskill and upskill while also creating 4.7 million new tech jobs. The study used machine learning to predict how technology would transform the tasks that make up each job and presents an unprecedented chance for Indian workers to reshape and future-proof their careers.\n\n\u201cReskilling and upskilling will play a pivotal role in this transition. The future workforce needs to focus on analytical, creative, and collaborative skills, the areas where human intelligence excels. For those concerned about job security, the best approach is to stay ahead by embracing continuous learning and evolving with the technology. Change is inevitable, but it also offers growth and innovation for those prepared to meet it,\u201d Mahajan adds.\n\nTo thrive in the evolving workforce shaped by AI, it is essential to not just adapt but actively prepare by developing relevant skills. A significant shift in organisational roles is already on the horizon. A research titled Defining the Enterprise of the Future by Alteryx reveals that 58% of business leaders foresee the emergence of the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) as a critical role, tasked with overseeing a comprehensive AI strategy across departments like IT, compliance, HR, and beyond. However, the role is still in its infancy, with just over 400 individuals globally holding this title on LinkedIn.\n\nMoreover, companies are urgently seeking specialised talent. Top hiring priorities include AI applications engineers (47%), who design and develop AI-powered models, AI/ML engineers (36%), focused on building and maintaining self-learning systems, and AI research scientists (35%), whose innovations drive the future of AI systems. These roles highlight how the AI revolution is not only about automation but also about creating new job opportunities that require advanced expertise.\n\n\u201cSkills will continue to be a significant challenge across organisations. I also face this challenge of retaining skills; it\u2019s not just about bringing in new skills. It\u2019s equally about keeping the existing ones,\u201d says Amit Luthra, MD-ISG, Lenovo India. \u201cNow, this is a challenge because you want to move into areas that are outside your comfort zone. You\u2019re trying to accomplish tasks that have never been done before, which involves a learning process,\u201d he adds.\n\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report, by 2025, half of all employees would need to reskill due to the growing impact of automation and AI. However, the same report offers a positive outlook, projecting that AI will also generate 97 million new jobs in fields such as data analytics, AI development, and digital marketing.\n\nWhile some roles may be fading into the background, a new wave of AI-related positions is rapidly emerging. Professionals specialising in developing, managing, and optimising AI systems are in high demand. Roles like AI applications engineers, AI/ML engineers, and AI research scientists have seen a staggering 74% annual growth over the past four years, according to LinkedIn, making it one of the fastest-growing job categories.\n\nRamesh Mallya, CTO, DBS Bank India says, \u201cWe are investing in upskilling our employees in critical areas like cloud computing, AI and machine learning\u2026 By equipping our people with the latest skills, we ensure that we continue to deliver solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI empowers organisations to enable their workforce to focus on more strategic and impactful tasks, while the technology handles the mundane,\u201d shares Sachin Dutta, COO, Canara HSBC Life Insurance. \u201cWe firmly believe that there is a need to bolster human-AI collaboration as well,\u201d he adds.\n\nSuccessfully navigating this shift will require a commitment to continuous learning. Workers will need to develop a mix of technical and soft skills. While technical abilities like programming, data analysis, and knowledge of AI models are becoming increasingly important, equally crucial are skills like critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability, the qualities that are much harder for machines to imitate.",

        "text": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across various sectors is not just a trend but a transformative force reshaping the future of work in the modern world. In this rapidly evolving technological landscape, the need for reskilling and upskilling has become paramount. As AI continues to advance, it is essential for tech workers to embrace continuous learning to remain relevant and competitive.\n\nThe AI-driven transformation of the job market\n\nAI is revolutionising the job market by automating routine tasks and creating new opportunities that require advanced skills. According to the World Economic Forum, by 2025, 85 million jobs may be displaced due to the shift in labour division between humans and machines.\n\nHowever, this same transition is expected to generate 97 million new roles that are better suited to the evolving landscape. These new roles will demand a workforce proficient in AI, machine learning, data analysis, and other emerging technologies.\n\nThe necessity of reskilling\n\nReskilling involves learning new skills to transition into different job roles, which is crucial as AI takes over more traditional tasks. For instance, customer service roles are increasingly augmented by AI tools that handle initial queries, necessitating workers to learn how to manage AI systems and address complex issues that require human intervention.\n\nSimilarly, in financial services, employees are now required to understand and leverage AI to make better investment decisions, as highlighted by an IBM report stating that nearly 70% of financial services leaders believe significant upskilling is necessary in 2024.\n\nThe importance of upskilling\n\nUpskilling, on the other hand, enhances existing skills to improve performance in current roles. This is particularly important as AI tools become integral to daily operations.\n\nA study by MIT found that workers using AI tools like ChatGPT reported a 37% increase in productivity, demonstrating how AI can significantly augment human capabilities. In healthcare, for example, professionals are using AI to speed up medical diagnoses, allowing them to focus more on patient care and complex decision-making.\n\nBridging the skills gap\n\nThe rapid advancement of AI has exposed a significant skills gap in the workforce. Many organisations struggle to implement AI effectively due to a lack of skilled personnel. According to a survey by Boston Consulting Group, 66% of executives are dissatisfied with their progress in scaling AI initiatives, primarily due to this skills gap. Addressing this gap requires comprehensive training programs that focus on both reskilling and upskilling.\n\nBenefits for individuals and organisations\n\nFor individuals, reskilling and upskilling offer several advantages. Workers equipped with the latest skills are less likely to be displaced by automation and are more likely to be hired and promoted, leading to higher job security and career advancement opportunities. Engaged employees who are continuously learning and growing tend to have higher job satisfaction and morale. Additionally, workers with new or enhanced skills can command higher salaries and have access to better job opportunities due to their broader range of expertise.\n\nFor organisations, having a skilled workforce enhances productivity and innovation. Skilled workers are more efficient and can leverage AI to drive innovation, which is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the market.\n\nFurthermore, organisations that invest in their employees' development tend to have higher retention rates. The LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report found that opportunities for learning and development significantly influence job satisfaction and retention. By providing targeted training programs, organisations can bridge the skills gap, ensuring they have the necessary talent to implement and scale AI effectively.\n\nFostering a culture of continuous learning\n\nCreating a culture of continuous learning is vital in an AI-driven world. This involves not only providing formal training but also encouraging on-the-job learning and mentorship. AI itself can play a role in this by offering personalised learning experiences and identifying skill gaps through data analysis. For example, AI can create customised training programs tailored to an individual's role and career aspirations, enhancing the learning experience and effectiveness.\n\nSocial and economic implications\n\nThe benefits of reskilling and upskilling extend beyond individual and organisational gains to broader social and economic impacts. The World Economic Forum's initiative to prepare one billion people for tomorrow's economy by 2030 highlights the global urgency of this issue. By equipping the workforce with the necessary skills, we can ensure inclusive growth and mitigate the risks of technological unemployment.\n\nThe imperative for tech workers to reskill and upskill in the age of AI is undeniable. As AI continues to transform the job market, staying ahead of the curve through continuous learning is essential. Embracing this change and investing in skill development will enable both individuals and organisations to thrive in the dynamic landscape shaped by AI.",

We need companies to say: \u2018I\u2019ve tried something, it failed, but I learned a lot from it.\u2019\u201d\n\nGemmell agreed, arguing that fostering a culture of experimentation required investment. \u201cProviding employees with opportunities to explore AI tools, to experiment and even to fail can lead to significant breakthroughs,\u201d she said, challenging HR teams to rethink traditional training and development models.\n\nStrategic investment in AI\n\nThe discussion also addressed the growing need for strategic AI investment. Neal Riley, CIO of The Adaptavist Group, pointed to the rise of \u2018co-generation\u2019 tools that blend human reasoning with AI capabilities, enabling faster innovation. \u201cWe\u2019re moving toward a world where you can take an idea and turn it into a proof of concept in production far more quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nTurner raised concerns about the dominance of tech giants such as Google and Microsoft, whose resources enabled them to lead the AI revolution. \u201cI worry the next two years will see power concentrated even more,\u201d she warned. However, she added: \u201cI\u2019d like to see more upstarts come through and upset the apple cart.\u201d\n\nFor HR and employees, this means preparing for a diverse AI landscape. \u201cOrganisations investing now are not going to regret it in two years,\u201d said Turner.\n\nExperimentation, curiosity and creativity\n\nAs businesses navigate the challenges of integrating AI, panellists called for a focus on experimentation, curiosity and creativity.\n\nTurner urged organisations to \u201ckeep on experimenting\u201d, while Gemmell encouraged workers to stay \u201ccurious\u201d and open to new tools.\n\nRiley closed the discussion with a rallying cry for creativity. \u201cKeep being creative\u201d in how AI is used, he urged, reminding organisations that innovation would be central to thriving in an AI-driven future.\n\nFor further information, view the CIPD\u2019s resources on the use and impact of AI in the workplace",

        "text": "Imagine a world where customer service is available 24/7, personalized for every individual, and can solve complex problems instantly. Or envision manufacturing processes optimized by AI that can predict and prevent machinery failures before they occur. This is the promise of Agentic AI\u2014a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence that integrates autonomy, adaptability, and strategic decision-making to solve complex challenges with minimal human intervention.\n\nIn 2025, Agentic AI represents a turning point. Unlike traditional rule-based AI or content-focused generative AI, Agentic AI operates dynamically, understanding context, analyzing data, and executing tasks autonomously. However, this transformative technology raises a critical question: what will happen to the millions of workers whose roles may be displaced by AI automation? Without intervention, these shifts could exacerbate existing economic disparities. Reskilling, therefore, becomes an urgent priority for nations in the Global South.\n\nThe Rise of Agentic AI and Its Implications\n\nAgentic AI transcends automation, enabling applications to manage complex tasks with reasoning and strategic planning. This evolution marks a fundamental shift in how industries operate\u2014from static automation to dynamic and context-aware systems. By 2028, Gartner (2023) predicts that at least 15% of daily workplace decisions will be made independently by such systems. While this promises significant productivity gains, it disrupts traditional labor markets and necessitates a proactive approach to workforce adaptation through reskilling initiatives.\n\nReskilling: A Critical Priority\n\nReskilling equips workers with the skills needed to thrive alongside advanced technologies. For industries adopting Agentic AI, this includes digital literacy, AI operation, data analysis, and soft skills such as problem-solving and adaptability. Governments in the Global South must create frameworks to foster these competencies. This effort includes exploring multilateral or bilateral collaborations, such as leveraging platforms like APEC, ASEAN, or BRICS forums, which provide mutual benefits. For technology-exporting nations, such partnerships open new markets and enhance global influence. For the Global South, they accelerate access to cutting-edge tools, expertise, and resources, fostering workforce competitiveness and inclusive growth.\n\nAdditionally, B-to-G partnerships with major technology companies such as Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Bytedance, and NVidia can be pursued to leverage advanced tools and resources for reskilling initiatives. These partnerships are essential for technology companies as they provide opportunities to expand their market reach, gain insights into emerging economies, and strengthen their global presence. By contributing to workforce development, these companies enhance their reputation as socially responsible entities and ensure a skilled labor force capable of maximizing the potential of their technologies.\n\nIncentives to Drive Reskilling Efforts\n\nIncentivizing industries to support reskilling is paramount. Here are some proposals from the author, along with benchmarks from other regions that offer valuable insights:\n\nTax Incentives: Governments can reduce corporate taxes for companies investing in employee training programs. These incentives can also be extended to companies providing training to communities, local populations near factories or corporate operations, or MSMEs. Singapore\u2019s example demonstrates a proactive approach to workforce development through fiscal incentives. Businesses can deduct 100% of qualifying training expenditure as a business expense. This applies to a wide range of training activities, including courses, workshops, seminars, and conferences. Under the Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS), introduced to further incentivize training, businesses can enjoy a 400% tax deduction on the first S$400,000 of qualifying training expenditure each year from YA 2024 to YA 2028. Such measures ensure continuous investment in workforce skills, showcasing a benchmark for other nations aiming to align fiscal policy with human capital development.\n\nSubsidized Training: Offering financial support for skill development courses can encourage both workers and employers to participate. Funding for these subsidies can come from a mix of sources, including government budgets allocated for workforce development, contributions from international development agencies, and public-private partnership agreements with major technology companies. Such diversified funding ensures sustainability and scalability for training initiatives. In Germany, for example, the Federal Employment Agency subsidizes training programs, including digital upskilling, for both employed and unemployed individuals.\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships: Collaborations between governments, educational institutions, and industries can create tailored training programs aligned with market needs. These PPPs could further involve initiatives such as establishing reskilling hubs in rural areas, offering mobile training units for underserved communities, and co-developing AI-powered learning platforms. Such partnerships enable skill development to scale efficiently while directly addressing the unique needs of the Global South.\n\nDigital Platforms: Accessible platforms that connect workers with training opportunities and funding sources can bridge gaps in workforce readiness. These platforms do not need to be limited to websites or apps; they can also operate via chatbots, which are highly accessible for marginalized communities with limited internet connectivity, low digital literacy, or financial constraints. Integrating gamification into these platforms makes learning engaging and fosters a sense of achievement, encouraging higher participation rates. India\u2019s eSkill India platform, for example, integrates gamification and mobile accessibility to promote learning among its diverse population.\n\nAdapting to the Global South\u2019s Context\n\nThe Global South requires tailored strategies considering its unique socio-economic challenges. For instance, addressing digital infrastructure gaps, ensuring equal access to training for informal sector workers, and integrating reskilling efforts with broader educational reforms are crucial. Furthermore, leveraging Agentic AI itself to create personalized learning experiences can amplify the effectiveness of reskilling programs.\n\nConclusion\n\nAgentic AI\u2019s potential to revolutionize industries in the Global South is undeniable. However, realizing its benefits requires a holistic approach, with governments, industries, and international stakeholders collaborating to prioritize reskilling. By implementing strategic incentives, bridging skill gaps, and fostering inclusivity, nations can ensure technological progress leads to sustainable and equitable economic growth.",

        "text": "Workforce dynamics and assigning job roles according to changing workforce nature can be challenging things. You can see that there are various new technologies, techniques, tools, etc that are introduced to different industries that change the working roles. Simply, workforce dynamics refers to the evolving structure, management, and work performance within a workforce. It includes the interactions, connections, and behaviors between teams, management, and employees that are impacted by demography, technology, culture, and the state of the economy.\n\nSo as mentioned earlier job roles provided according to changes can be an issue that needs to be solved. Employees also have to upgrade their skills with the changing workforce as according to a Future of Jobs report, 40% of the workforce will need reskilling shortly. 68% of workers are aware of disruptions in their fields and are willing to reskill.\n\nTo enhance job roles and solve problem-related workforce dynamics, various technologies can be implemented or have been implemented. AI-powered automation is one of the most trending technologies that various organizations have implemented to create a balance between workforce and job roles. AI-powered automation has a substantial impact on job roles and workforce dynamics by replacing mundane tasks, changing current roles, and generating new tech-focused jobs. As AI collaboration increases, workers will need to upskill, emphasizing both technical and soft abilities. This change improves the employee experience by encouraging agile teams and flexible work schedules.\n\nArtificial intelligence individually has a great impact on different industries as well for the enhancement of industrial automation too in 2024, AI and automation will assume a pivotal role in the automation of industries driven by AI, with 85% of the respondents concurring that the delivery of value through enhanced productivity and efficiency will be paramount. AI\u2019s ability to analyze data, provide information, and use automation to replace human labor for easy, repetitive tasks can be the game changer.\n\nIn this article, we will see the role or impact of AI-powered automation on workforce dynamics and job roles. We will also see some other details like benefits, challenges, etc. We will end the discussion with a summary paragraph.\n\nWhat are the effects on workforce dynamics and job roles?\n\nAI-powered automation can refer to the application of artificial intelligence technology to carry out repetitive tasks, data processing, and decision-making that normally call for human intelligence. With a lot of solutions that ease down the procedures, promote agility, improve cooperation, and facilitate remote work. Existing roles change as regular work may be replaced, creating new opportunities in data analysis and AI development.\n\nUpskilling and reskilling are required for this change, with a focus on both technical and soft skills. Overall, AI-powered automation can change the way people perform their job roles and also enhance their skills according to workforce dynamics.\n\nBenefits of AI-powered automation on workforce dynamics and job roles\n\nThere is a lot of AI-powered automation on workforce dynamics and job roles as here are a few key benefits mentioned below.\n\nIncreased efficiency\n\nWith the workforce dynamics, many job roles work for some repetitive tasks. This makes the employees busy and does not let them focus on more complex tasks. This cannot contribute to enhancing the efficiency. Where AI-powered automation increases productivity by streamlining repetitive operations and freeing up staff members to concentrate on higher-value work.\n\nJob evolution\n\nJob evolutions are very important in an ever-changing workforce. This enhances the productivity of the organization but this is not possible to evolute employees and take them responsibilities that they can do better. With AI-powered automation, this is possible to analyze and suggest automatically on the basis of employee engagement, freeing up workers to take on more strategic and creative roles.\n\nSkill development\n\nDue to the changing nature of work, an organization cannot replace employees as they are not skilled in new systems. Replacing employees with new employees could create more problems for the organization. This will be better to train the existing employees and AI-powered automation can do this very efficiently. AI-powered automation can analyze the behavior and skill level of employees and make them learn skills that suit the new nature of work.\n\nWork-life balance\n\nEmployees want flexibility between their work and life. With the manual system, workload increases create pressure on them, even at the off time to work. This can cause a drop in the productivity of employees. Where employees can have more flexibility and a better work-life balance when their burden is reduced via AI-powered automation. This technology can manage the workload by automating various tasks.\n\nCost saving\n\nWorkforce dynamics can be costly as there can be updates of new and modern things. Any more errors or faults can cost organizations more which could affect their overall revenue generation. Where AI-powered automation can analyze the pattern, and performance of the system and automatically warn if any error is detected. This increases overall cost efficiency for the organizations.\n\nChallenges with AI-powered automation\n\nWe have seen various benefits of AI-powered automation while implementing workforce dynamics and job roles. There are a few challenges too as there are few noticeable challenges mentioned below.\n\nAI-powered automation is a very advanced technology that has much more capability and potential than human employees. So job displacement fear could be a challenge for many employees.\n\nEthical challenges can be an issue as organizations must manage the ethical issues around AI use, especially those about privacy, monitoring, and openness in decision-making.\n\nOverreliance on technology can be a serious issue as any fault or cyberattack could result in a loss for organizations.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAI-powered automation has the potential to revolutionize worker dynamics and job roles by increasing productivity, improving teamwork, and opening up new career prospects. There could be a few drawbacks while implementing AI-powered automation for workforce dynamics and job roles but that could be negotiable with the passing time.\n\nOrganizations may maximize the advantages of AI-powered automation while minimizing its disadvantages by making investments in reskilling, encouraging an adaptable culture, and giving ethical issues a priority. In the end, a more inventive, resilient, and dynamic workforce can result from a careful integration of automation, setting up businesses for success in a changing environment.\n\nAt Aeologic Technologies, we specialize in providing cutting-edge AI-powered automation solutions that help businesses navigate these changes and unlock their full potential.",

        "text": "By Aarul Malaviya, Founder, Zamit\n\nThe advent of AI has been causing a transformational shift across industries all over the world and this has had a direct impact on the employment market. On the one hand, AI automation leads to improvements in the organisation\u2019s efficiency and productivity, but on the other hand, it creates job disposability and thus requires constant skill upgrades and skill development. This evolution calls for employee and employer readiness to proactively respond to the changes to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nEmployment: A review of the current status\n\nNew jobs for machines and automation can create global economic displacement. In a World Economic Forum report, it is predicted that up to 85 million new jobs could be moved to automation and artificial intelligence technologies by 2025, and at the same time, new jobs well adapted to new roles of humans, machines, and algorithms will be created\u201497 million. This net gain points to the evolving nature of the labour market, where traditional functions get mechanised and new careers open up in the areas of IT.\n\nComplex and higher-skill demand jobs in technology, problem-solving, and creativity are on the rise. For instance, there is an increased demand for AI specialists, data analysts, and digital marketing professionals. In a study conducted by McKinsey Global Institute, it was estimated that up to 12 million workers may need to change their occupational category and learn new skills by the year 2030 because of automation. It has therefore become imperative that workers and employees continuously up-skill and re-skill to experience career growth.\n\nSkill enhancement, which involves acquiring new skills to stay competitive in one\u2019s current role, and skill development or training for transitioning into new roles, are essential strategies for success in today\u2019s evolving landscape. LinkedIn Learning revealed that 90 percent of companies are concerned about employee retention, and 4 in 5 people want to learn how to use AI in their profession When organisations invest in the growth and education of their workers, they can have a more adaptable workforce. Governments are also beginning to realise this need. The UK government, for instance, initiated the National Skills Fund, with \u00a32. 5 billion to assist adults to acquire new competencies and devise for technological transformation in the place of work.\n\nLifelong learning as a necessity\n\nWith the rapid pace of technological advancement, education is no longer confined to early life. Education is now a process that goes on throughout one\u2019s life. According to the OECD, improving literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills in working with the population will increase employment chances and improve their wages.\n\nThis is to the effect that the new media have facilitated continuous learning. There are online courses ranging from coding to data science that help learners acquaint themselves with new market trends.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAI\u2019s integration on an increasingly large scale necessitates continuous upskilling and reskilling to stay relevant in the ever-evolving world. This implies that individuals, businesses, and governments should work together in order to promote lifelong learning and the qualifications of the population to meet the demands, which are continuously evolving with the times. Education must evolve to not only future-proof individuals but also to empower them to thrive in an AI-driven world. Through a focus on digital skills, analytics, and AI governance, we can ensure a workforce that remains both relevant and resilient in the face of technological advancements.",

        "text": "Carly Holm examines AI\u2019s impact on tech jobs and the need for companies to adapt with the right tools or partners\n\nIn March, employees in the marketing and communications division at IBM were reportedly told in a staff meeting that their numbers were being culled. This news substantiated a recent pattern of layoffs in the technology sector, which have included cuts at Amazon, Apple and Meta. Combined, these reports have amounted to at least 74,000 workers being laid off by 255 tech companies in 2024 alone, according to layoffs.fyi.\n\nSome jobs will indeed be lost to this new technology, but other new opportunities will pop up in their place as a result of the shift to AI\n\nThe existential \u2018threat\u2019 of technology, whether real or imagined, has been feared by the front-line worker since at least the era of the Industrial Revolution. Today\u2019s advancements in technology, particularly including the rise in popularity of artificial intelligence (AI), are the latest iteration of this fear.\n\nBalancing profit with workforce impacts\n\nWe have been told by none other than Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk that AI may render employment a luxury item: \u201cYou can have a job if you wanted to have a job for personal satisfaction,\u201d Musk said at an event last year, \u201cbut the AI would be able to do everything.\u201d\n\nYet we also know that corporations have shareholders to satisfy and increasingly choose to cut expenses \u2013 including jobs \u2013 to stimulate (or simulate) continuous growth.\n\nThe motivation to not only succeed in today\u2019s fast-paced business landscape but to stand out, intensifies substantially in a field as competitive and fickle as technology. It also makes the allure of AI\u2019s advertised production-boosting and cost-reducing benefits almost irresistible for companies.\n\nIBM\u2019s shift towards AI: Layoffs and upskilling\n\nIn January of 2023, IBM announced that 3,900 positions would be slashed from the company\u2019s workforce. Then, in August, the company announced it would be replacing 8,000 jobs with artificial intelligence instead.\n\nThese updates were followed in December by CEO Arvind Krishna saying that IBM would be \u201cmassively upskilling all of our employees on AI\u201d. Are these events related? Absolutely. Will embracing AI ultimately help IBM (and others who follow suit) become more efficient, and therefore more profitable? Possibly. So where do business leaders go from here when it comes to AI? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nWhy going all-in on AI isn\u2019t the answer\n\nPredictions about the future of artificial intelligence vary wildly from expert to expert \u2013 and even among the CEOs whose job it is, in large part, to sell investors and the public on the promise of AI.\n\nThis relatively new technology rivals Henry Ford\u2019s factory line and the internet in terms of its potential to upend traditional business strategy and the current makeup of our overall workforce, yet it isn\u2019t clear whether executives are taking the full measures of its implications.\n\nYou might call AI the elephant in the corporate room, but it might be more accurate to describe it as the 800-pound gorilla in every C-suite.\n\nPredictions and realities\n\nA working paper released by MIT in January found that currently only 23% of worker wages being paid for vision tasks would be attractive to automate for a business, and suggested that AI job displacement will be substantial, but also gradual.\n\nIn its 2023 report on The State of AI at Work, Asana favoured a \u201chuman-centred AI approach\u201d that emphasises worker participation rather than displacement. Yet Asana also found what it described as a \u201ccrisis in AI transparency\u201d, in which only 32% of employees feel their company has been transparent about its use of AI \u2013 including fewer than half of executives.\n\nOther predictions are a bit more grim, such as the Chicago Booth Review noting that the path of technological progress has produced many head-on collisions between innovation and the labour market and calling for a policy and programme-heavy approach that will minimise negative outcomes for workers.\n\nPolicies and programmes, however, come with their own host of issues. They take time to develop, demand compromise and often translate to additional costs. None of these outcomes perfectly align with the immediate interests of corporations or their leaders.\n\nSo if AI is the future, what incentives do companies have to protect the security and earning power of workers whose roles will ultimately be usurped by machines?\n\nBe ready to respond, adapt and evolve\n\nA quick scan of the most cogent research and informed predictions on artificial intelligence in the workplace reveals just one thing: there are no certainties yet. The mysteries surrounding how far AI can carry industry into the future, and how quickly it will get there, far surpasses the current research available.\n\nEven the most modern-thinking organisations, who may feel inspired to jump into this technological advancement and replace each employed worker with an AI bot, can foresee potential risks in drastically reshaping their workforce so quickly.\n\nOne certainty we can clearly draw is that AI will become an increasingly valuable commodity available to companies going forward. Organisations will need to be nimble in their hiring, training and restructuring \u2013 including that necessary upskilling of workers.\n\nAI can indeed learn from itself, but its deep-learning models need to be fuelled (and constantly tweaked) by humans with an holistic understanding of a department\u2019s and company\u2019s goals.\n\nSome jobs will indeed be lost to this new technology, but other new opportunities will pop up in their place as a result of the shift to AI.\n\nJob losses and new opportunities\n\nIn the technology sector in particular, companies must be ready to navigate economic volatility and the shifting winds of VC investment. As artificial intelligence continues to advance in every department from marketing to IT roles, organisations will need to adapt and reshape their workforce.\n\nThere will be job cuts. But there will also be training, upskilling and the redefining of responsibilities of existing workers. Some roles may be eliminated in the face of AI, but existing workers may see a benefit in new training, upskilling and redefining of role descriptions and responsibilities.\n\nNew types of workers will need to be hired. Companies need to be equipped with the tools, or aligned with an outsourcing partner who can empower them, to respond to all of these changes as they come.\n\nCarly Holm is founder and CEO of Humani",

        "text": "Amid intense debates over Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI (GenAI) causing job loss going forward, a study by ServiceNow, in collaboration with Pearson, has projected that AI could actually drive employment growth, creating an estimated 2.73 million jobs in India by 2028.\n\nThe study highlights that tech-driven sectors \u2014 particularly retail, manufacturing, education, and healthcare \u2014 will require an influx of skilled workers. Retail alone is projected to add 6.96 million roles, presenting opportunities for reskilling in fields such as software application development, and data engineering.\n\nThis is likely to be followed by manufacturing (adding 1.50 million jobs), education (0.84 million jobs), and healthcare (0.80 million jobs), propelled by expected economic growth and tech transformation.\n\nA contrarian view is that India\u2019s demographic dividend, once celebrated as a key economic advantage, may turn into a liability if sufficient opportunities don't emerge for the growing workforce.\n\nShankar Sharma, investor and founder of AI company Gquant, argued in an opinion piece for Moneycontrol: \u201cToo much has been written, said, and marketed about India's demographic dividend. Maybe it was a dividend at some point in time, but we know how dividends have been taxed through our financial policies.\u201d\n\nHe added a stark warning: \u201cMore than 60% of India's economy comes from services, sprawling across all aspects of daily life, from IT and KPOs to finance and legal services. There is nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 that AI won\u2019t be able to do better than any individual in these areas, including, perhaps, the CEO.\u201d Sharma believes that the aspirations of India\u2019s youth don\u2019t align with traditional factory jobs, one of the few sectors, he predicts, that will offer long-term employment.\n\nSumeet Mathur, senior vice president & managing director, ServiceNow India Technology & Business Center, said: \u201cAI will be a key catalyst for job creation across India\u2019s growth engines, particularly in roles requiring advanced technical skills. This strategic emphasis will not only create more high-value opportunities for professionals but will also empower them to build enduring digital careers.\u201d\n\nAlso Read\n\nServiceNow and Pearson, both of which deal with the IT industry directly, and, unlike Sharma, are not mere investors, in their report highlighted that tech-related jobs are growing across industries.\n\nLeading this trend are software application developers, with an expected increase of 1,09,700 positions. Other notable roles include systems software developers (48,800 new jobs) and data engineers (48,500 new jobs). Web developers, data analysts, and software testers are also on the rise, with projected additions of 48,500, 47,800, and 45,300 roles, respectively.\n\nHowever, what analysts, industry players, and experts agree on is that use of GenAI will mean high productivity gains. For instance, the ServiceNow report shows that systems administrators will experience the largest shift, with 6.9 hours of their weekly tasks automated or augmented by emerging technologies.\n\nAI systems engineers will also benefit significantly from GenAI, with half of the total tech impact on this role coming directly from AI technologies. Similarly, implementation consultants are poised to benefit significantly from the integration of GenAI, saving 1.9 hours per week as AI takes over repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more strategic projects, the ServiceNow report says.",

        "text": "The average half-life of skills is now less than five years. In some technology skills, it\u2019s as low as two and a half years. [1] Building the right capability is no longer a good-to-have, but is a strategic priority for organizations navigating dynamic business environments amid continuous technological changes, and the impending skills gap. It is clear that merely gaining certifications isn\u2019t enough; a robust reskilling strategy is essential to keep people up to date with advancements.\n\nThe digital age demands that individuals and organizations adopt new technologies and ways of doing business. The recent rise of Generative AI (Gen AI) opens immense opportunities in every field, including workforce transformation.\n\nGen AI and Skilling\n\nThe rate of learning new skills must adapt to the evolving pace of technological advancements. Modern learners expect a great learning experience with hyper-personalized content, engaging recommendations, and intelligent career advancement guidance.\n\nThe ability of Gen AI to create original content paves the way for relevant and personalized instructional design. AI-led personalized learning journeys have already been introduced. On an organizational level, conversations around productivity, efficiency, employee experience, upskilling, and reskilling are increasingly linked with AI elements such as Gen AI and AI ethics.\n\nHowever, while many HR functions are leveraging digital tools, they aren\u2019t effectively implementing AI-related initiatives. [2]When it comes to digital tools, the proportion of organizations not using any technology has dropped from 15% in 2021 to 9% in 2023. As of February 2023, when ChatGPT was just launched, only 5% of survey respondents were using it, and a further 6% were planning to. [3]\n\nHowever, one of the top priorities for HR leaders in 2024 is assessing and integrating new HR technologies like Gen AI[4]. HR and business leaders can start by understanding how Gen AI works and its potential. Here\u2019s how:\n\nLeveraging Gen AI for Future-Ready Skilling\n\nContinuous Content Creation: Learning content often needs to be updated due to rapidly evolving needs. AI software can help continuously update and adapt training content, allowing for scaling up. Although 69% of L&D professionals are skilled in creating and curating content, only 3% currently harness tools to support curation. [5]\n\nPersonalized and Adaptive Learning Pathways: AI can use detailed learner data to assess competencies and learning styles and design customized content. However, it is essential to minimize information overload, ensure relevance to the task, and create practice opportunities.\n\nCreation of Realistic Simulations: Gen AI can create realistic, highly experiential training simulations and gamification that respond dynamically to user decisions. It can also translate training content to match cultural and language differences.\n\nEnabling Real-Time Feedback: Modern AI-based tools offer an interactive approach, providing instant feedback and answering real-time queries by automating assessments.\n\nEquipping People with More Time for Creative Work: Gen AI can take over mundane tasks, freeing L&D professionals to focus on more value-adding cognitive work.\n\nPredicting Future Skill Gaps: Gen AI can analyze employee data to predict potential skills gaps, helping to future-proof the organization from a skills-readiness perspective.\n\nThe Human Element of AI\n\nDespite the numerous possibilities, challenges, and concerns about AI and Gen AI need to be addressed. At the top of these concerns is the fear of losing jobs. For example, what role will today\u2019s instructional designers have if a Gen AI tool starts curating learning interventions? L&D leaders need to find the right mix of skills and technology for the jobs in the function.\n\nAdditionally, since Gen AI builds from available data, it raises concerns about data privacy and protection. The ethical aspects of Gen AI are under constant debate, especially regarding the thin line between personal and organizational data. Existing data may contain biases, and there is a risk of perpetuating these biases.\n\nMore than over-reliance on technology is required. L&D leaders must retain the human touch, the foundation for future skill-building. L&D professionals must leverage human interventions to empower people.\n\nFor example, working closely with line managers is imperative, as they define learning needs and encourage participation in learning. Continuous monitoring and validation of AI outputs through feedback mechanisms are essential to ensure the quality of training content. While Gen AI can create content, L&D must support learners by making this content accessible, available, and relevant for the job to drive learning and AI adoption.\n\nThe Way Ahead\n\nAligning learning with business goals continues to be L&D\u2019s top focus area.[6]This upskilling strategy requires an adequate blend of machine and human intelligence. HR and L&D leaders must embrace digital curiosity to learn, experiment, and lead by example. The L&D toolkit should include both methods and media, combining them to support evidence-informed practices that improve learner engagement, transfer, and impact.[7]\n\nGen AI-led learning cannot exist in isolation; it must be integrated into the overall ecosystem. L&D is not just about learning; it is a powerful tool to build connection, purpose, and meaning. Companies must embrace both AI skills and career development to energize and retain talent, developing skills agility\u2014harnessing the right skills at the right time for the right work. This is critical to unleashing the skills advantage for a future-ready organization.\n\nSources:\n\n1. [Reskilling in the Age of AI](https://hbr.org/2023/09/reskilling-in-the-age-of-ai)\n\n2.

        "text": "As AI reshapes global labour markets, India is at a crossroads\u2014it is poised for growth, but is also facing key challenges. AI offers opportunities, but barriers like infrastructure gaps and workforce readiness remain. Amidst this is the rising anxiety of job displacement as highlighted in the Economic Survey 2024-25.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe survey threw a spotlight on the intensified concerns and fears about AI disrupting labour markets as developments in the field have continually demonstrated rapid progress over the last four years. The increasing complexity of the models being developed today represents a paradigm shift in the field of AI, with anticipation of \u2018intelligent machines\u2019 being capable of performing tasks predominantly handled by humans today.\n\nIndia, leveraging IT to power its growth, has a relatively young population eager to be employed in the sector. The country has many large companies providing worldwide IT services, and is particularly vulnerable to this fear, said Dr Sujata Seshadrinathan, Director of IT and Process, Basiz Fund Services.\n\n\u201cLike most path-breaking, disruptive IT innovations, AI too is expected to bring many benefits and challenges, impacting how we deal with a host of things, apart from information generation and associated developments. For instance, the significant job displacement and its subsequent detrimental impact on society predicted by many leading international organisations is not unfounded. While jobs could be lost to AI replacing the workforce, reskilling and building institutions through collaboration between policymakers, the private sector, and academia is how this can be mitigated,\u201d she said.\n\nKashyap Kompella, an AI Industry Analyst, observed since India is the fastest-growing large economy, the adoption of AI domestically in different sectors can accelerate this growth. But as the Survey points out, large-scale adoption of AI will happen over a much longer period. That gives India enough runway to plan for a soft landing, he said.\n\nIndian technology services sector\n\nHowever, the effects of AI can be felt sooner in other areas. \u201cWestern markets, where labour costs are high, are likely to adopt AI much earlier than India. For instance, the Indian technology services sector, which caters to the Western economies, accounts for a big chunk of high-paying jobs and drives significant domestic consumption. Since AI solutions require consulting and implementation services, opportunities will arise, complemented by reskilling.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cGen AI is making us question the conventional wisdom about the types of jobs that will be impacted. The assumption is AI will automate only low-value, routine work, but we can see that high-value, creative professions are also at risk. According to me, when it comes to jobs, AI is now collar-blind. Both white-collar and blue-collar jobs are susceptible to automation.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s central role\n\nAlongside, global capability centres (GCCs), which have emerged as major recruiters, also rely on the country\u2019s vast talent pool and growing expertise in AI, giving these centres a competitive advantage in delivering cutting-edge solutions. The rise of AI Centres of Excellence also emphasises the country\u2019s central role in shaping the future of innovation, supported by its talented workforce, shared Milind Shah, Managing Director of Randstad Digital in India.\n\nThe Survey also highlights the importance of skill education, especially around new-age technologies like AI, ML, IoT, big data, and robotics.\n\n\u201cA specific scheme focused on skill education on these new-age technologies right from the school level can be a game changer. The government should also look at establishing an AI University to further accelerate the adoption of AI. To ensure the right development and AI adoption, the government must also accelerate the investment in the compute infrastructure and invest significantly in GPUs. A focus on manufacturing in India could be a game changer,\u201d shared Devroop Dhar, Managing Director, Primus Partners.",

        "text": "Generative AI has officially entered the chat and it has brought with it all sorts of new questions and complications about how it can be used and abused to make AI use safe and ethical for everyday use, lawmakers, creators and users may all have to work together before the technology outpaces us all. The Biden Harris administration has introduced *** number of guidelines around the use of AI. There's the executive order which provides standards for safety while fostering innovation. There's the blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which, by the way, is *** white paper, not *** binding piece of government policy. There's AI.gov, which includes job listings in the field, and the National AI advisory Committee, which is tasked with advising the president on all things AI. And that's just at the national level. Many states have proposed or even enacted legislation as well. The Biden administration materials appeared to be an optimistic and cautious approach to dealing with AI while aspiring to protect those who use it or whose data is used by it every day. The use of AI has global implications as well. The EU has passed an act outlining its approach to AI, and there have been *** few summits between countries that typically haven't found common ground. What are some of the issues these policies attempt to prevent? Some have begun to question the quality of data going into shaping AI for public use, citing embedded biases in gender and ethnicity for AI generated content, which could make using AI for non-discriminatory hiring practices *** potential challenge. To make matters worse, generative AI makes the creation of deep fakes significantly easier. Victims of deep fakes have had to advocate for themselves in *** legal arena that's still unformed. For instance, at *** high school in New Jersey, girls were targets of cyber bullying via AI created nude photos and videos. They were left without any direct recourse. Then there's the questions around copyright, creativity, academic integrity, disinformation, misinformation, and fraud, and perhaps some areas we humans haven't even yet foreseen. Even though legal action for AI related crimes could take time, legislation is in the works. *** bipartisan task force in the US House is working on ways to add guardrails to AI use, like increased civil and criminal punishments for crimes committed with AI, such as imitating someone's voice. Another potential model for the US could mimic the EU's AI Act, which hits companies with financial penalties for violating the policies. As AI becomes increasingly commonplace, legislators will need to work even faster to outline its limits for public use.\n\nAdvertisement 41% of companies worldwide plan to reduce workforces by 2030 due to AI Share Copy Link Copy\n\nArtificial intelligence is coming for your job: 41% of employers intend to downsize their workforce as AI automates certain tasks, a World Economic Forum survey showed Wednesday.Out of hundreds of large companies surveyed around the world, 77% also said they were planning to reskill and upskill their existing workers between 2025-2030 to better work alongside AI, according to findings published in the WEF\u2019s Future of Jobs Report. But, unlike the previous, 2023 edition, this year\u2019s report did not say that most technologies, including AI, were expected to be \u201ca net positive\u201d for job numbers.\u201cAdvances in AI and renewable energy are reshaping the (labor) market \u2014 driving an increase in demand for many technology or specialist roles while driving a decline for others, such as graphic designers,\u201d the WEF said in a press release ahead of its annual meeting in Davos later this month.Writing in the wide-ranging report, Saadia Zahidi, the forum\u2019s managing director, highlighted the role of generative AI in reshaping industries and tasks across all sectors. The technology can create original text, images and other content in response to prompts from users.Postal service clerks, executive secretaries and payroll clerks are among jobs that employers expect to experience the fastest decline in numbers in coming years, whether due to the spread of AI or other trends.\u201cThe presence of both graphic designers and legal secretaries just outside the top 10 fastest-declining job roles, a first-time prediction not seen in previous editions of the Future of Jobs Report, may illustrate GenAI\u2019s increasing capacity to perform knowledge work,\u201d the report said.Conversely, AI skills are increasingly in demand. Close to 70% of companies are planning to hire new workers with skills to design AI tools and enhancements, and 62% intend to recruit more people with skills to better work alongside AI, according to the latest survey, conducted last year.Striking an optimistic note, the report said the primary impact of technologies such as generative AI on jobs might lie in their potential for \u201caugmenting\u201d human skills through \u201chuman-machine collaboration,\u201d rather than in outright replacement, \u201cparticularly given the continued importance of human-centered skills.\u201dHowever, many workers have already been replaced by AI. In recent years, some tech firms, including file storage service Dropbox and language-learning app Duolingo, have cited AI as a reason for making layoffs.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe current state of AI in upskilling the workforce is rapidly evolving. With technological advancements transforming the job market, it's estimated that over one billion jobs will be reshaped by 2030. The World Economic Forum predicts that half of the global labor force will need professional retraining by 2025. Unfortunately, 92% of managers feel unprepared to handle the digitization of work and cultivate talent that can manage these upcoming changes.\n\nTo stay ahead, employers must focus on upskilling and reskilling their workforce. Upskilling involves training that builds on or adds to a worker's existing skill set, enabling them to perform better in their current position. Reskilling, on the other hand, refers to learning new competencies that are not within an employee's existing skill set, preparing them for a completely different career path.\n\nTo effectively upskill and reskill, companies must identify and close skill gaps by conducting skills audits, using skills intelligence tools, and predicting future needs. By doing so, they can equip their workforce to thrive in the age of AI.\n\nA New Era of Collaboration and Efficiency\n\nThe world of work is on the cusp of a revolution, driven by the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). As AI continues to evolve, it's transforming the way we work, and the future of the workforce hangs in the balance. Will AI replace human workers, or will it augment their abilities, making them more efficient and productive? The answer lies in the midst of a paradigm shift, where humans and machines collaborate to create a new era of work.\n\nA Role Reversal: Humans Assisting Machines\n\nA Role Reversal: Humans Assisting Machines refers to the concept where humans will be responsible for supporting and assisting machines, rather than the traditional view of machines assisting humans. This shift is expected to occur in the context of AI in upskilling the workforce, as machines become increasingly sophisticated and capable.\n\nIn this scenario, humans will work alongside machines, providing them with the necessary support and guidance to perform tasks effectively. This may involve training machines, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring that they are operating at peak performance.\n\nThe idea of a role reversal is not far-fetched, as we are already seeing signs of this trend in the workplace. For instance, AI-powered tools like Github Copilot are changing the way developers create code, making them more efficient and productive. Similarly, AI is transforming industries like financial services and legal, streamlining research and eliminating manual tasks.\n\nAI's Cross-Industry Impact\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is making a significant impact across various industries, revolutionizing the way businesses operate and deliver value to their customers.\n\nIn retail, AI-based personalization insights are helping businesses offer tailored recommendations to customers, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction. For instance, a clothing retailer observed a 25% increase in sales after implementing AI personalization.\n\nIn the realm of employee experience, AI is transforming HR, making recruitment and support more efficient and engaging. Leading organizations are launching AI-powered HR assistants to streamline employee inquiries, reduce HR workload, and enhance employee satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of AI in upskilling the workforce are to:\n\nEquip employees with the necessary skills to work alongside AI-powered tools and machines, ensuring that they can effectively collaborate and contribute to the success of the organization.\n\nPrepare employees for the changing workplace dynamics, where many routine tasks will be automated, and higher-order thinking tasks will become more critical.\n\nEnable employees to work on more complex and challenging projects, leveraging AI-powered tools to streamline their work and increase productivity.\n\nEmpower employees to make data-driven decisions, using AI-powered analytics and insights to inform their work and improve outcomes.\n\nFoster a culture of continuous learning and development, where employees are encouraged to upskill and reskill regularly to stay relevant and competitive in the job market.\n\nEnsure that employees are well-versed in the ethical and responsible use of AI, promoting transparency, fairness, and accountability in the workplace.\n\nThe Rise of AI-Powered Learning and Upskilling\n\nAI-powered learning and upskilling are becoming increasingly relevant in today's workforce. As technology advances, the demand for employees with AI-related skills is growing rapidly. By investing in AI-powered learning and upskilling programs, organizations can equip their workforce with the necessary skills to succeed in an increasingly automated world.\n\nAI-powered learning platforms offer personalized training and upskilling opportunities, tailored to the needs of individual learners. These platforms can identify skill gaps and recommend relevant courses, tutorials, or resources to enhance learners' competencies. By considering individual learning styles and preferences, AI fosters equitable access to educational resources, empowering individuals from underrepresented groups to pursue new job opportunities.\n\nMoreover, AI-powered tools can help bridge the skills gap by providing real-time feedback and guidance to learners. For instance, AI-powered language learning apps can analyze a user's speech and offer suggestions for improvement, helping them build confidence and enhance their language skills.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe future of learning in the AI age demands a collaborative effort to bridge the reskilling gap, ensure equitable access to education, and adapt educational models for a rapidly evolving world. This is not just about acquiring technical expertise, but fostering a culture of lifelong learning, collaboration, and a shared vision for a better future. By embracing this learning renaissance, we can empower individuals and businesses to thrive in the AI age.\n\nThe future of AI in upskilling the workforce involves a shared responsibility among companies, individual workers, and society as a whole. Companies must invest in upskilling and reskilling programs, while workers should embrace lifelong learning and continuous adaptation.",

        "text": "The marketing landscape is rapidly evolving, driven by the increasing adoption of new and innovative technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way businesses operate, and its impact on the marketing and sales sectors is particularly significant. As AI and automation continue to advance, it is crucial for organisations to ensure that their workforce is equipped to handle these emerging technologies and maintain a competitive edge.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead More\n\nThis article discusses the skills gap that exists between marketing staff and the new technologies, and the strategies that organisations can employ to bridge this gap and prepare their workforce for the future.\n\nProfessor Srinivasa Reddy - Assistant Professor and Professor Jayanthi Thanigan - Associate Professor, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI) has shared how bridging the skills gap is important to emerging technologies in marketing and sales.\n\nRISE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN MARKETING\n\nThere is a rise in new and disruptive technologies in the marketing domain. While the last decade saw a rise in the use of digital marketing tools, new tools using Artificial Intelligence are coming to the fore today. The Harvard Business Review highlighted that most of the new technologies can handle higher-order knowledge work, including research and writing.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis raises the Luddite argument that new technology is replacing jobs, more particularly white-collar jobs. N. Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons, recently highlighted that while AI and automation drive productivity, it could also lead to job losses in some domains. However, the key is to reskill the existing workforce to handle the new technologies.\n\nDISRUPTION IN THE MARKETING DOMAIN\n\nDisruption in the marketing domain is occurring in all domains. Call centre operations may be disrupted if well-trained AI bots become available. Digital marketing jobs such as content generation, social media monitoring, and ad optimisation are also in the cross-hairs of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, there are integrated developments, like the most recent release from ZS Associates, an AI-based tool that allows large-scale omnichannel personalisation, a feature existing solutions lack. By understanding the unique characteristics of a customer, specific pieces of content or product recommendations can be made to her.\n\nNEED FOR TRAINING\n\nIn such a dynamic environment where advanced AI tools are available, it is vital that the workforce is trained to handle these technologies to retain a competitive advantage. The age of ERP can be taken as an example. The initial users gained high operational profits, but when ERP technology was available to all, the impact on operating profits dropped. In the case of AI too, content generation tools are available to all.\n\nSKILLS GAP\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe skill gap between marketing staff and these new technologies is large. Most marketing employees are engaged in a high-touch environment, meeting customers or working with creative teams to develop quality communications. The use of technology, such as social media, is transactional and intuitive.\n\nThese tools are used to get the message across to customers. However, artificial intelligence requires much more skills than intuitive usage. Reskilling for AI needs more commitment from the organisation and the staff than for previous technologies.\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR RESKILLING\n\nOrganisations need to identify the important technologies which could enhance customer experience. Based on this assessment, the appropriate technologies can be rolled out for employees to learn. There are several options for reskilling employees. One would be on-the-job training, where training is conducted on live tools to handle operations.\n\nThe second is reskilling at educational institutions, where employees are trained in conceptual and applied aspects of technology in-depth. Hence, AI offers more opportunities than challenges to the marketing domain.\n\nA detailed reskilling program which is lead by strategic objectives, with the right training partners and motivated employees could be the root of future competitive advantages for companies.\n\nPublished By: Shruti Bansal Published On: Aug 12, 2024",

        "text": "The looming tsunami of automation fueled by AI demands a bold response. With 800 million jobs globally at risk by 2030, as predicted by the McKinsey Global Institute, the stakes are undeniably high. Upskilling and reskilling employees with the right skillset to thrive alongside intelligent machines becomes an imperative, not a choice. This new skillset transcends mere technical expertise. It equips them with critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and the agility to navigate a rapidly evolving work landscape.\n\nIn the face of this digital deluge, India, with its young and energetic workforce, stands at a critical juncture. Organisations here are not standing idly by. They are proactively equipping their teams with the skills needed to thrive in the AI era. At the forefront of this massive transformation are HR leaders, guiding their workforces to not only survive the onslaught of AI but emerge stronger and more adaptable.\n\nOn this International HR Day 2024, we delve into the innovative strategies Indian companies are deploying for AI reskilling, and the challenges they face in this crucial journey.\n\nTop AI Initiatives in India\n\nBuilding AI Literacy: The foundation for an AI-ready workforce starts with strong AI literacy. Leading companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), LTI Mindtree, and SAP are prioritising this by implementing training programmes and fostering a culture of continuous learning. \"A strong foundation in AI is crucial for our employees' future success,\" emphasises Janardhan Santhanam, VP & Chief Learning Officer at TCS.\n\nDeveloping AI Skills: Companies are investing in programmes to equip their workforce with technical expertise. Tata Projects, for instance, is offering specialised training in machine learning and data science, targeting engineers and project managers. \"The future workforce must leverage AI's full potential,\" said CHRO Ritesh Pratap Singh.\n\nHappiest Minds Technologies has achieved good results with its AI skills development programme. Over 85% of their employees have gained basic awareness of AI and fundamental development skills. Rajesh Chandran Sogasu, Senior Vice President at Happiest Minds Technologies, emphasises, \"A future-ready workforce is key to our success.\"\n\nAB InBev GCC India is prioritising fostering a culture of lifelong learning among their employees. \"Skills in problem-solving, communication, and innovation are indispensable as they enable individuals to harness AI's full potential,\" said Runa Dhawan, People Director, GHQ India, AB InBev.\n\nFuture-Proofing Human Capital: Pegasystems and Godrej Properties are actively revamping their learning and development programmes to foster crucial cognitive skills such as critical thinking, and data analysis. \"Our focus is on equipping our employees with the cognitive skills needed to navigate the complexities of the AI economy, such as critical thinking and problem-solving,\u201d said Megha Goel, Chief Human Resources Officer, at Godrej Properties.\n\nAI-powered Learning Platforms: Tech giant LTIMindtree is leveraging AI-powered platforms to personalise learning journeys, identify skill gaps through analyses, and recommend relevant courses for their employees. \"We are actively exploring this technology and its potential to revolutionise the way our employees learn and develop,\" asserts Ritu Chakrabarty, Global Head - Learning and Development (Shoshin School), LTIMindtree.\n\nALSO READ...\n\nAutomating Manual Tasks: AI is transforming HR by automating repetitive tasks, freeing up employee time for more strategic work. Companies like Tata Projects and Orion Innovation are deploying AI for this purpose. Ritesh Pratap of Tata Projects, emphasises, \"However, we are committed to carefully evaluating the impact of automation on employee roles and ensuring a smooth transition.\" This might involve reskilling initiatives or redeployment opportunities for impacted employees.\n\nKey challenges in AI integration and reskilling\n\nThe journey towards an AI-ready workforce is fraught with challenges. Here are the top hurdles in AI integration and reskilling as shared by the leaders:\n\nData Quality and Accessibility: Ensuring high-quality, accessible, and up-to-date data is a critical challenge in leveraging AI effectively for decision-making and workforce development. As Amit Sahoo, Global HR Head and CHRO at Narwal, mentioned, \"Data Quality and Accessibility: Ensuring high-quality and accessible data to support accurate AI-driven insights and decision-making\" is a top priority.\n\nSecurity and Intellectual Property Concerns: Addressing security, privacy, and intellectual property concerns while using AI, particularly with sensitive employee and business data, is a significant hurdle. Janardhan Santhanam, VP & Chief Learning Officer at TCS, highlighted this challenge: \"The first major hurdle lies in establishing clear guidelines to effectively address privacy, security, and intellectual property concerns.\"\n\nChange Management and Cultural Shift: Overcoming resistance and fostering a cultural shift is a common challenge. Ritesh, emphasised, \"The biggest challenge is the limited use of advanced technologies in the EPC sector. This sector continues to be labour-intensive with a low degree of automation, technology, and analytics. The challenge continues to remain the acceptance and the comfort of using technology for many. It causes for a mindset change to understand and leverage the benefits of technology.\"\n\nTalent Acquisition and Skills Gap: Recruiting and retaining skilled AI professionals, such as machine learning engineers, data scientists, and prompt engineers, is a major challenge due to the competitive landscape and shortage of specialised talent. As Ritesh noted, \"Another key challenge we faced was bridging the skills gap and acquiring talent with expertise in AI-related domains.\"\n\nEthical Considerations: Ensuring ethical standards and effective communication of complex AI concepts to non-technical users is a priority for companies like Pega. Smriti Mathur, VP --People India & Global Talent Advisory at Pega stated, \"Our top challenge in integrating AI into workforce development has been ensuring effective communication of complex ideas to non-technical users and maintaining compliance with ethical standards in our offerings.\"\n\nCost and ROI Assessment: Evaluating the long-term cost implications and projecting the return on investment (RoI) for enterprise-wide AI implementation is a challenging task, as noted by TCS. Janardhan Santhanam stated, \"Secondly, GenAI as an industry is extremely dynamic, making it hard to assess cost implications associated with implementation at the enterprise level and project RoI from a long-term perspective.\"\n\nIndustry-specific Challenges: Certain industries, like the EPC sector mentioned by Tata Projects, face challenges due to the labour-intensive nature of operations and the relatively low adoption of advanced technologies and automation.\n\nFuture AI integration plans\n\nWhile navigating the challenges, companies are actively charting their paths to further leverage AI capabilities. Their future plans span a wide array of initiatives:\n\nPredictive Analytics and Workforce Planning: Amit highlighted, \"Moving forward, Narwal plans to further leverage AI by enhancing predictive analytics to anticipate workforce trends, optimise resource planning, and inform strategic decisions.\"\n\nEnhancing AI-powered Knowledge Bases and Information Retrieval: Ritesh emphasised, \"AI-powered knowledge bases have revolutionised the way we access and retrieve information within our organisation. By leveraging AI algorithms, we've created intelligent systems that can quickly search through vast amounts of data to find relevant information, best practices, and lessons learned from previous projects.\"\n\nExpanding AI Integration across More Business Functions: As Arun Paul, stated, \"As AI capabilities evolve, our organisation aims to expand the use of automation across more business functions to increase efficiency and empower employees.\"\n\nInvesting in Generative AI for Production Processes and Client Offerings: Smriti Mathur from Pega mentioned, \"Looking ahead, our organisation plans to further leverage AI by continuing to invest in Generative AI in our production processes, impacting both our developers and clients positively.\"\n\nFostering Global AI Developer Communities and Partner Ecosystems: Pega will also \"focus on cultivating a global community of developers through initiatives like Pega Academy, benefiting our partner ecosystem.\"\n\nIntensifying Reskilling Efforts to Bridge Future Skills Gaps: Shraddha Naik from SAP emphasised, \"The rise of Business AI has an impact on the skills we need going forward, so we will intensify our reskilling efforts so that as many employees as possible adopt the skills needed for future growth.\"\n\nWhile data quality and integration challenges persist, a wave of strategic AI initiatives is gaining momentum. Companies are actively investing in upskilling programmes and fostering a culture of continuous learning to equip their employees for the evolving AI landscape.\n\nAs Janardhan Santhanam, VP & Chief Learning Officer at TCS, aptly summarised, \"Adoption of GenAI requires the right capabilities and more importantly, a mindset change to start using AI to assist, augment, and transform entire business processes along with technologies like IoT, Cloud, Blockchain, etc.\"\n\nHappy International HR Day 2024!\n\nWith inputs from Mastufa Ahmed!\n\nDoes the evolution of generative AI and the business-technology intersection fascinate you?

Should the focus be on social support and redistribution rather than employability?\n\nThe rise of AI is also putting SkillsFuture in the spotlight: What should the movement aim to achieve and what does success look like?\n\nAs I see it, employability is certainly not a lost cause.\n\nJobs will still be the principal source of livelihood for the next generation, but continuous retraining will become the new norm. Even with employability as the overarching goal, training objectives will vary across workers.\n\nFor the national SkillsFuture movement, broad statistics such as training numbers and job placement rates only tell part of the story; more granular metrics are also needed to evaluate programmes and inform the reskilling approach.\n\nJOBS AND SKILLS REMAIN VITAL FOR SINGAPORE'S SOCIAL COMPACT\n\nNotwithstanding predictions of large-scale job losses, the history of innovation suggests that new technology creates at least as many new jobs as it destroys.\n\nIn the long term, technological advances do not reduce the aggregate demand for manpower or work hours.\n\nHowever, new technology will create winners and losers as it transforms jobs and eliminates others. Those with skills to complement AI could see an increase in productivity and enjoy higher wages, whereas those lacking in such skills could be displaced into lower-paid employment.\n\nSingapore\u2019s social compact continues to be premised on the principle of \u201creward for work; work for reward\u201d.\n\nThe expectation remains that citizens will provide for themselves and their families via employment income and savings. Their housing, healthcare and retirement needs will be met principally by Central Provident Fund contributions set aside from work income.\n\nWhile the Government is stepping up collective support in the form of social transfers and risk pooling, as well as strengthening social safeguards, there is unlikely to be a fundamental change in the social compact.\n\nAs long as job opportunities are available, citizens are expected to work for a living. Singapore\u2019s ageing population and slowing workforce growth suggest that the labour market will continue to be tight in the long term, barring cyclical downturns triggered by external shocks.\n\nIn this context, it is imperative that Singapore continues to create good jobs amid intense global competition. What is different from the past is the pace of technological change.\n\nJobs and skills are transforming so quickly now that remaining in the same job and firm throughout one\u2019s working years will be the exception rather than the norm.\n\nYoung Singaporeans have to be prepared for multiple job and career switches, along with the retraining that is needed to take on new job roles.\n\nSKILLSFUTURE MUST ADDRESS MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES\n\nWhat types of training are needed, and how can the SkillsFuture movement better support workers and employers to meet these needs?\n\nIt is, in fact, necessary for SkillsFuture to address a wide spectrum of training objectives.\n\nThere is considerable variance in workers\u2019 needs depending on their industry, job role, skill sets and career aims. For some, it is about increasing their productivity and effectiveness at work.\n\nFor instance, teachers may consider how to better deploy technology and AI to enhance pedagogical efficacy.\n\nFor others, it is about acquiring skills to take on transformed job roles within the same organisation, like bank tellers picking up skills in customer service and sales as routine work is increasingly automated.\n\nYet others will seek to retrain for entirely different sectors and occupations, while some will seek to acquire additional skill sets (second skilling) with a view to future career moves, to supplement their income or to enhance employment resilience.\n\nTHE WHO, WHY, WHAT AND HOW OF RESKILLING\n\nSkillsFuture must therefore address the who, why, what and how of reskilling.\n\nWho needs reskilling? The answer is everyone, but needs differ.\n\nMinister Chan identified mature workers in their 40s and 50s as a group requiring particular attention, given their higher risk of skills obsolescence and retrenchment.\n\nAmong employers, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are also in focus given their relative lack of resources and time to invest in training.\n\nWhy should firms and workers invest in training? For many, the answer is obvious.\n\nThe challenge for the SkillsFuture movement is to motivate those who may be less aware or inclined towards training to invest the time and resources in doing so, given that all industries, firms and workers, to a greater or lesser extent, will be affected by technological change sooner or later.\n\nHere, research can play a part in unpacking the psychosocial aspects of training motivation, to devise more effective approaches to reach out to employers and workers, especially SMEs and mature workers.\n\nWhat types of courses and training should be offered? This will depend on the skills currently in demand, and those that are expected to become increasingly important in future.\n\nWhile the Government\u2019s economic strategy will shape demand for jobs and skills, it is also important to take in the inputs of industry, technology experts and training providers.\n\nThe range of training on offer should span modular, bite-sized courses to more substantive training courses leading to full qualifications.\n\nThere must be courses catering to technical skills as well as those that equip workers with broader skill sets such as leadership, self-mastery and interpersonal skills.\n\nHow should training be conducted?\n\nThis is about andragogy, the art and science of adult education.\n\nAdults may learn differently from children, hence the distinction between andragogy and the more familiar discipline, pedagogy.\n\nThe teaching of adults should be informed by research, and ought to cater to different learning styles and preferences.\n\nHigher education institutions are well-placed to build up expertise in andragogy through both their pre-employment training and continuing education programmes for young adults and mature workers.\n\nAs the national centre for excellence in adult education, the Institute of Adult Learning can drive and coordinate these efforts as well as propagate expertise by training adult educators and helping companies develop their own training programmes.\n\nIf this can be done well and at scale, it would make our workforce and businesses more competitive and better equipped for the AI era.\n\nADDRESSING THE 'SO WHAT?'\n\nPerhaps the most critical question that SkillsFuture must address is what training will do for the individual.\n\nSome workers are understandably reluctant to invest time in training unless they see tangible returns in the form of higher wages or career advancement opportunities.\n\nWhere possible, training programmes should be closely intertwined with an organisation\u2019s transformation plans, including business process and job redesign, so that workers can put their new skills to work and be rewarded for it.\n\nOn their part, workers should also be cognisant that not all retraining may lead immediately to higher pay. In some instances, retraining is critical to avoid redundancy or to enhance career resilience.\n\nThe payoffs to training may not always be measured by higher wages, but could also be reflected in the avoidance of layoffs and redundancy, as well as the possibility of new jobs and higher future earning potential.\n\nIn March this year, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) reported that about 560,000 individuals and 20,000 enterprises participated in SSG-supported programmes in 2022, fewer than in 2021 but higher than in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nA survey by SSG found that 97 per cent of about 58,000 trainees indicated that they were able to perform better at work after undergoing SSG-supported training.\n\nWhile these broad metrics are relevant in tracking the progress of SkillsFuture at the national level, they should be complemented by more granular metrics that assess the effectiveness of programmes vis-\u00e0-vis the objectives of participating employers and workers.\n\nThese may include how much time workers spend using the skills they have acquired on the job, and whether there are measurable improvements in productivity, work performance and employee satisfaction.\n\nSuch measures can in turn inform the design and delivery of training programmes to cater to the diverse needs of firms and workers.\n\nAdvances in technology, most notably AI, have made the SkillsFuture even more critical for Singapore\u2019s economic and social well-being than when the movement was launched in 2015.\n\nIt is vital that employers, workers and all Singaporeans embrace the culture of lifelong learning, and continue to seek ways to improve the efficacy of retraining in partnership with training providers, academia and policymakers.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nTerence Ho is an associate professor in practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the author of Governing Well: Reflections on Singapore and Beyond (World Scientific, 2023).",

        "text": "By Jill Goldstein\n\nGenerative AI is already fueling massive workforce changes, driving a host of talent-related issues for business leaders, and raising questions about the scale of its impact on the future of work. HR leaders play a critical role in navigating these organizational changes by rethinking workforce planning, design, and strategy for the era of AI.\n\nAs more business leaders embrace the technology, a new IBM survey shows that building new skills for existing employees is the most pressing talent issue for C-Suite leaders. The survey also found that executives estimate that 40% of their workforce will need to reskill as a result of implementing AI and automation over the next three years.\n\nFor many organizations, employees at all levels will feel the impact of generative AI. But it\u2019s lower-level employees that will likely be most affected in the short term. Seventy percent of executives surveyed say entry-level positions are already seeing the effects of generative AI, compared to only 22% who say the same for executive or senior management roles.\n\nAI\u2019s impact on work will only intensify. Now is the time to get ahead of the growing disruption. Organizations have a responsibility to prepare their employees for this changing landscape, so their workforce is resilient and ready. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to shepherd their organizations into the future.\n\nHR leaders should consider several actions to guide their strategies in this new era of AI.\n\nEstablish a new operating model, reimagining the work itself.\n\nA significant advantage of generative AI is the ability to automate repetitive and manual tasks, unlocking more opportunities for employees to focus on higher level work. In fact, 87% of executives expect job roles to be augmented rather than replaced by AI. Yet, building the business of tomorrow cannot run with yesterday\u2019s talent, and tomorrow\u2019s talent cannot be plugged into yesterday\u2019s operating model.\n\nThe key to success is structuring work strategically. Rethink and re-engineer work by identifying and eliminating lower value tasks that can be handled by AI, merging roles to create new ones, expanding roles to include tasks like applying or managing AI tools, and creating targeted skill development for higher-level tasks driven by people. IBM data shows that those organizations that evolve their operating model and put new technologies at the core are already outperforming their peers on revenue growth.\n\nInvest in both talent and technology with skills at the forefront.\n\nTo prepare their employees for new applications of AI, leaders need to put skills at the center of a workforce strategy. This starts with a focus on increasing the general technical acumen of the entire workforce. While this does not mean every employee needs to be a technical AI expert, every employee should be familiar with AI applications. Roles and skills will change, and every employee should have a basic understanding of AI so they can embrace the change and apply technology to enhance their capabilities.\n\nThis is an opportunity for reskilling and upskilling in both technology and key behavioral skills, equipping employees with the relevant skills to work with AI creatively and responsibly. In addition to providing resources like apprenticeship programs and on-demand learning tools, empower employees to lead their own learning journey to gain the skills that are important to them.\n\nCultivate a culture of engagement and transparency.\n\nAI has the power to transform the employee experience, helping employees improve productivity and speed adoption of new ways of working. But success is dependent on employees seeing AI technology as being valuable to their jobs. It\u2019s imperative for leaders to share their vision with employees and be transparent about how AI will be applied.\n\nYet, IBM\u2019s survey shows that employees and employers are not aligned when it comes to the most important attributes at work. Employees are prioritizing impactful work over all other job attributes beyond compensation and security. Employers haven\u2019t recognized this fact, ranking impactful work the least important factor to their employees. This disconnect will only increase tension as more organizations rush to automate as many mundane and repetitive tasks as possible.\n\nIt\u2019s important to engage employees in the process of re-evaluating the tasks to be automated. They should be empowered to provide recommendations on how AI can make their jobs better and more fulfilling. When redesigning processes to incorporate AI, bring the employees who will use it into the design process, encouraging them to share their insights and feedback.\n\nAI plays a significant role in driving productivity, but this won\u2019t happen with technology alone. Led by HR, organizations need to embrace a new approach to change management that includes cultivating new ways of working, shaping new job responsibilities, and driving a cultural shift in the organization. With AI\u2019s profound impact on jobs, how an organization rolls out the technology will be key to achieving business value.\n\nJill Goldstein is managing partner of talent transformation for IBM Consulting.",

        "text": "Generative AI in combination with legacy technologies like robotic process automation (RPA) and machine learning has the potential to substitute and augment human work for a significant variety of tasks, especially for work involving like data analysis and synthesis, content generation, customer support, and even aspects of software development, a senior official said.\n\nWhile this can lead to efficiency gains and enable employees to focus on higher-value-added work, it has the potential to affect employment in numerous, particularly white collar, jobs. \u201cAt the same time, demand for AI specialists, data scientists, and machine learning engineers is growing rapidly, as companies seek talent to build, manage, and improve AI systems. Employers in the UAE are increasingly looking for candidates with strong digital skills, including social media skills, the ability to navigate online tools and platforms, and the skills to work with generative AI and large language models,\u201d said Ravin Jesuthasan, global leader of Mercer's Transformation Services business.\n\nUltimately, the impact on the job market will depend on how organisations and individuals adapt, emphasising the importance of upskilling and reskilling in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. As employers place increasing value on individuals with a diverse skill set who can adapt to changing industry demands, we will see a shift toward skills-powered employment, leading to a new focus on lifelong learning, continuous skill development and providing individuals with the tools they need to stay competitive in the labour market.\n\nThe UAE has positioned itself as a global leader in AI as part of the UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, underscoring the nation's commitment to innovation and economic transformation. There are a significant number of government-supported training programmes aimed at bridging skills gaps and preparing the workforce for AI integration, recognising that achieving the full potential of generative AI requires intentional, human-centric work design.\n\nAdvertising Advertising\n\n\u201cSo, while we will likely see AI impacting jobs that involve routine tasks that are easier to automate, we're also likely to see a transformation in the types of new roles that the UAE is actively recruiting for, accompanied by a positive impact on productivity and creativity,\u201d Jesuthasan said.\n\nGenerative AI is most useful in democratizing knowledge and creativity through augmentation, lowering the skills premiums traditionally required for a variety of creative tasks where the goal is achieving productivity gains or seeking a breakthrough through an innovative solution to a problem. It can be a valuable tool for boosting productivity where the tolerance for risk is higher (i.e., the consequences of a mistake are low). Compelling use cases have ranged from copywriting to call centre operations where it has demonstrated significant value in boosting productivity particularly for the least experienced talent as it helps reduce the \u201cexperience premium\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs result, business leaders will need to understand when to rely on - and when not to rely on - generative AI and the specific role it should have in either substituting, augmenting of transforming human work. There are key steps that businesses should be taking now, such as establishing a work model that includes AI and developing future skills with AI in mind. Companies need to be upskilling and reskilling their workforce to adapt to AI advancements and adapt roles and skills to account for greater human-AI collaboration,\u201d Jesuthasan said.\n\nIn addition, it's important for companies to encourage a shift in their culture so that they can embrace a mindset of perpetual reinvention to take full advantage of AI's democratization of knowledge and creativity.\n\nLeaders need to understand the cost of all their resources whether it is human or a machine, Jesuthasan stressed. T\u201dhis means capturing the cost of all types of work options (e.g., employees, gig workers, outsourced labour, process automation, AI, etc.) on a like-for-like basis through a measure like the total cost of work (TCoW),\u201d he added.\n\nTCoW is defined as total labour cost (e.g., full-time employees, free agents, gig workers) + vendor cost (e.g., outsourcing cost, AI and robotics vendor cost) + annualized capital charge for relevant capitalized investments (e.g., company-developed AI or robotics, equity stakes in third-party work options). \u201cIt is important to put all work options on a comparable basis so that the analysis is not distorted by differences in accounting treatment (e.g., labour cost is expensed, while the investment in robotics is capitalised). One should multiply the company's cost of capital by the total capital investment in work options like AI/robotics and alliances so as to capture the annualized charge for using these options,\u201d Jesuthasan said.",

        "text": "Almost 72 per cent of the organizations surveyed by the Infosys Generative AI Radar (North America) said they were planning to increase Generative AI investments, expecting benefits ranging from enhanced user experience and personalization to higher operational efficiency, streamlined product development, and easier content creation. However, 18 percent were concerned that, more than any other challenge, the lack of talent and skills would hinder implementation. All the organizations who participated in the survey were contemplating various measures to address this issue. For employees, this is a signal to acquire AI skills and embrace an AI culture without hesitation. Doing so would not only help them stay relevant, but actually prosper, in the workplace of the future.\n\nUpskill-first, AI-first\n\nWhen looking to bridge the AI talent gap, employers should prioritize upskilling and reskilling existing employees over recruiting new workers or leveraging the skills of partner firms. It is only fitting that they take an AI-first approach to deliver the best possible learning experience to employees. Such an experience offers certain advantages, which I shall now outline.\n\nHighly adaptive and personalized to individual learners: Enterprise Learning Management Systems have made remarkable progress; but previously, these platforms were designed for scale, and therefore, to provide standardized content and a defined learning path to all employees, irrespective of their individual needs, learning abilities, or motivations. There was no way to personalize a training program to individual requirements, since using manual means was infeasible in terms of both cost and time. Now, however, by rearchitecting learning management systems with an AI-first approach, it is possible to assess the AI (and other) skilling needs of every learner and curate relevant content in real-time, at low cost. AI allows each employee to choose their own path, pace, and method of learning, and also adapts the program based on how they are progressing.\n\nReal-time and integrated: \u201cScheduled\u201d training programs, requiring employees to take time out from work, are quickly becoming a thing of the past. With employees able to spare only about 1 percent of their time for learning, employers need to find a way to deliver knowledge without interrupting work, ideally, exactly when it is required. Once again, AI offers a solution \u2013 micro learning modules that can be integrated within work processes, ready to be delivered at the right time. Think of an AI application developer who needs help with a piece of code; AI tracking tools can \u201csense\u201d this and automatically launch a bot to assist the employee.\n\nGamified and engaging: Learning management systems, although they provide rich, accessible knowledge, often deliver lower than expected outcomes. It appears that a major reason for this is lack of learner motivation. An AI-first platform addresses this by leveraging gamification principles to transform the learning process from a tedious chore to an exciting, engaging, and enjoyable experience. Learners can absorb the content better and are motivated to finish their assignments on time. For example, the platform could, based on an analysis of sales data, offer a gamified sales training program that introduces progressively advancing challenges and rewards, personalized to each salesperson. Interestingly, using an AI-based learning platform to train non-IT workers is a great way to make them comfortable with using AI at work.\n\nMultimodal AI-augmented: Apart from the software writing helper bot mentioned earlier, organizations can leverage AI-based coaches \u2013 an approach that is delivering good results. These tools mimic student-teacher interactions, reply to questions, and offer proactive assistance to learners. Multimodal AI-based tutoring is poised to become much more sophisticated with the introduction of Augmented/Virtual Reality, humanoid robots, and holographic teachers. At the same time, AI will enable multimodal pedagogy in formats such as text-to-text, text-to-video, and video-to-video.\n\nCurated and customized: As mentioned earlier, customizing training programs to meet individual needs was not possible for learning management platforms in the past. Also, despite the standardization, learning & development teams spent significant time and energy in developing the content despite its standardized nature. AI is coming to the rescue by scanning, finding, and piecing together the right content to make it easily consumable. Not only that, but Generative AI can also create and curate training materials to suit every user\u2019s context and preferences. And it can do this repeatedly, so content remains fresh, and training programs stay relevant.\n\nTo sum up, enterprises\u2019 path to AI adoption is being impeded by a serious talent-and-skills gap. This is an opportunity for employees to upskill their way to better career prospects. It is a win-win scenario because, from an employer standpoint, reskilling existing employees is a much better option than hiring new workers or leveraging third-party capabilities. As employers design their AI skilling programs, an AI-first learning approach would enable them to amplify outcomes.",

        "text": "\u201cBuild your skills, not your resume\u201d Facebook\u2019s former COO Sheryl Sandberg could not have said it better. The world of employment is undergoing a dizzying transformation squarely driven by automation and technological advancements. This presents a massive albeit challenging opportunity for India to thrive in the global employment landscape.\n\nThe global reskilling imperative\n\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that by 2030, automation will displace 800 million jobs globally while creating 525 million new ones. The report estimates that in the next six years, 600 million people globally will need reskilling and upskilling. This means that there must be a continuous learning mindset and adaptation for workers around the world to ensure skilling upgradation. The Forum's \u2018Reskilling Revolution\u2019 initiative aims to address this challenge by equipping a billion people with the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow. The programme especially brings in a focus on critical areas like digital skills, leadership, and green jobs.\n\nIndia's position in the reskilling transformation\n\nAs an economic leader, India is well set to reap the riches in this reskilling transformation. In fact, a report by the ed-tech platform Great Learning found that an overwhelming 85% of Indian professionals surveyed believe upskilling is important to future-proof their careers, compared to just 76% on a global scale. This data reflects a strong national drive and, very importantly, the individual desire to develop the skills needed to compete and excel in the evolving job market.\n\nThe era of artificial intelligence\n\nThis is indubitably the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is transforming industries, and this trend will only accelerate in the future. While AI may automate some jobs, it will also create new ones that require human-AI collaboration. A McKinsey Global Institute study forecasts that automation could displace 85 million jobs globally by 2025, impacting various sectors in India as well. However, the study also suggests that up to 95 million new jobs could be created in areas like AI, robotics, and data analytics, emphasising the need for reskilling in these emerging fields.\n\nBridging the skill gap\n\nWorking effectively alongside AI will be a crucial skill for future workers. Moreover, generative technologies like AI-powered design tools will match the creativity and problem-solving skills needed to pilot this evolving environment. Another interesting report by the World Economic Forum and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) estimates a potential skill gap of 23 million by 2030 in India, highlighting the urgency for upskilling initiatives. Not to mention a TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship insight that showcases that over 80% of Indian companies are actively looking to upskill their workforce to meet the demands of the digital age.\n\nTo bridge this skilling gap and ensure India's workforce is prepared for the future, certain strategies must be implemented. As always, the government will play a crucial role in promoting upskilling initiatives by providing funding, establishing skill development frameworks, and collaborating with the private sector. Planning for the future must include educational institutions and training providers working closely with industries to identify current and future skill needs and design the relevant curriculum. Additionally, for individuals, a culture of lifelong learning must be encouraged to continue skill development throughout one's career. Ultimately, the responsibility for upskilling lies within. Workers must take a proactive approach to identifying skill gaps in the system and pursuing learning opportunities.\n\nStudies suggest that investment in upskilling could potentially add $570 billion to India's economy by 2030. Our country\u2019s workforce must be equipped with the skills needed to not only compete but thrive in the global employment landscape of the future. This is imperative for India's continued green pastures in economic growth and development.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia has a golden opportunity to become a leader in the future of global employment. By implementing upskilling initiatives through the collaboration of governments, educational institutions, businesses, and individuals, the country can effectively bridge the skill gap in the digital age. Today\u2019s skills determine tomorrow\u2019s knowledge. Equipping our workforce with the necessary skills not only ensures their employability but also positions India as a formidable force in the global economy. The journey towards a skilled India is not just a necessity but a strategic imperative that will drive our nation towards sustainable growth and prosperity.",

        "text": "The Union Government is worried about the effects of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) automation on jobs and industry in India, but is comforted that the country\u2019s large number of science and tech graduates could be quickly retrained, and the lack of white collar jobs that are the most-affected by AI tools at the moment, a senior government official said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMinistry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) Secretary S. Krishnan said that besides major retraining and re-skilling efforts around AI, the government was also in support of helping manufacturing companies retrofit their supply chains with Internet of Things (IoT) devices that would collect the information and data needed for AI models to work in industrial scenarios.\n\n\u201cThere are two things which are important for me,\u201d Mr. Krishnan said. \u201cWhen you talk to companies, many people feel that the newer AI jobs, many of those will get created in India, for two or three reasons. One, that we have a large number of STEM train graduates, many of whom have exposure to AI far more than any other country in the world. And they can be quickly retrained into that space.\u201d Mr. Krishnan was speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry\u2019s (CII) Annual Business Summit 2024 here on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe second aspect is that we don\u2019t yet have as many white collar jobs in the services sector that many of the other advanced countries have, which will get more readily displaced compared to the kinds of jobs that we have. So both of these, I think, give rise to some hope and expectation that in the job loss scenario it may not be as bad a situation as it is in certain other economies. But I think a massive amount of retraining would be required and a massive amount of reskilling would be required so the population is ready for those kinds of jobs,\u201d Mr. Krishnan added.\n\nThe IT Secretary also said the Union government is ready to spend up to 50% of the cost likely to be incurred of creating computing capacity of up to 10,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential to building up India\u2019s AI technology capacity, under the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) mission.\n\nThe funding for the project could be done by the government either through a viability gap funding or voucher-based system, Mr. Krishnan said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry would be implementing key parts of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023 related to AI innovation and regulation after the elections end on June 4th, Mr. Krishnan said.\n\nAddressing an audience of largely small and medium business owners and executives, Mr. Krishnan said the government would like to see \u201cexisting industries be required to retrofit with IoT devices with sensors, which collect the kind of information which is needed for the data which is needed for AI models to really apply in the industry scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is an effort that we need to make to sort of actually apply these technologies across different industries. And that is an effort in which definitely MeitY and other ministries of the government of India will be quite happy to support,\u201d he added.\n\nThis is a Premium article available exclusively to our subscribers.

        "text": "LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Looking beyond current turbulence, the CEOs of the world\u2019s largest companies are increasingly optimistic about future growth, with 66% highly positive about the global outlook over the next three to five years. This is the headline finding of the second annual Arthur D. Little (ADL) CEO Insights Study, which was launched today. The study found that whatever their strategy or sector, global CEOs are increasing their growth investments.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is seen as crucial to growth, with 96% of CEOs having already deployed AI in some form, although, demonstrating the early stages of its adoption, just 13% have a compelling, enterprise-wide AI strategy in place.\n\nImportantly, CEOs understand that to get the best from AI, they need to focus on their people. Fifty-nine percent say they have a strong or very strong need to reskill their workforces to meet changing requirements, up from 13% in 2023. This trend is particularly pressing in sectors such as manufacturing, with a 63% increase in the need to reskill, and financial services (+55%).\n\nAlongside AI and reskilling, the third growth focus for CEOs is environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Over three-quarters (77%) are embedding ESG holistically across their organization, with CEOs believing its impact on growth strategies will increase by 26% over the next three years.\n\nAttitudes and plans do vary between sectors and regions. Seventy-eight percent of Asian CEOs forecast positive growth over the next three to five years, compared to 55% of those in South America, for example. Turning to AI, 69% of financial services CEOs had a company wide strategy or strategic view in place, in contrast to 56% of energy & utility companies.\n\nFrancesco Marsella, Managing Partner and Global Leader of the Growth and Transformation Practices at Arthur D. Little, comments: \u201cGiven today\u2019s business and geopolitical turmoil, it is extremely heartening to see that the CEOs of the world\u2019s biggest companies are positive for the future. The ADL 2024 CEO Insights Study shows that while they accept that conditions will remain volatile and turbulent, they believe a combination of resilient operating structures, clear strategies, AI innovation, and reskilling their people will enable their businesses to thrive in a sustainable future.\u201d\n\nIgnacio Garc\u00eda Alves, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Arthur D. Little, comments: \u201cThe world faces a range of pressing challenges, intensified by current turbulence. Innovation is central to overcoming these issues. Our 2024 CEO Insights Study shows that CEOs agree and are focusing on bringing together AI and human skills to innovate and move forward to ensure future success for their businesses and society as whole.\u201d\n\nThe Arthur D. Little 2024 CEO Insights Study interviewed nearly 300 global CEOs leading companies with a turnover of more than $1 billion. Thirty-nine percent headed businesses with annual revenues of over $10 billion. Study respondents are split between key industries and geographies to give unrivaled insight into the minds of those running the world\u2019s biggest organizations.\n\nThe full report, including recommendations from ADL, can be downloaded here: https://tinyurl.com/32czp9y9\n\nFor further information, please visit www.adlittle.com",

Chandrasekaran was speaking at the country\u2019s largest software services exporter\u2019s 29th annual general meeting (AGM).\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHis comments come a month after TCS\u2019 CEO and MD K Krithivasan had said in an interview with the Financial Times, that the progression of AI will lead to decreased demand for call centres, impacting the industry not only in Asia but also in other regions.\n\nAddressing shareholder queries at the AGM, Chandrasekaran said, \u201cIn certain areas, AI and Gen AI will automate stuff that will result in higher productivity and job losses. But in some other cases AI will require a lot more capability and a lot more jobs will be created in certain areas like data management, and so on and so forth\u2026it\u2019s a mixed bag and we have to actively embrace it to reskill people and prepare them to embrace the change.\u201d\n\nEarlier though in February, Krithivasan had said that AI and generative AI won\u2019t lead to reduction in hiring or job displacement, it will only change the way the IT services giant is training its employees. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad According to Chandrasekaran, every industry will be impacted due to generative AI, whether it is consumer or B2B.

        "text": "The rise of generative AI has surfaced many new questions about how the technology will impact the workforce. Even as AI becomes more pervasive in business, people are still a core competitive advantage. But business leaders are facing a host of talent-related challenges, as a new global study from the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) reveals, from the skills gap to shifting employee expectations to the need for new operating models.\n\nThe global skills gap is real and growing. Executives surveyed estimate that 40% of their workforce will need to reskill as a result of implementing AI and automation over the next three years. That could translate to 1.4 billion of the 3.4 billion people in the global workforce, according to World Bank statistics. Respondents also report that building new skills for existing employees is a top talent issue.\n\nAI\u2019s impact will vary across employee groups. Workers at all levels could feel the effects of generative AI, but entry-level employees are expected to see the biggest shift. Seventy-seven percent of executive respondents say entry-level positions are already seeing the effects of generative AI and that will intensify in the next few years. Only 22% of respondents report the same for executive or senior management roles.\n\nAI can open up more possibilities for employees by enhancing their capabilities. In fact, 87% of executives surveyed believe employees are more likely to be augmented than replaced by generative AI. That varies across functions \u2013 97% of executives think employees in procurement are more likely to be augmented than replaced, compared to 93% for employees in risk and compliance, 93% for finance, 77% for customer service and 73% for marketing.\n\nEmployees care more about doing meaningful work than flexibility and growth opportunities, but leaders aren\u2019t always in lockstep with their needs. With AI primed to take on more manual and repetitive tasks, employees surveyed report engaging in impactful work is the top factor they care about beyond compensation and job security\u2014more important than flexible work arrangements, growth opportunities and equity. On top of that, nearly half of employees surveyed believe the work they do is far more important than who they work for or who they work with regularly.\n\nHowever, employers seem to have missed the memo about what matters. Executives surveyed said impactful work was the least important factor to their employees, instead pointing to flexible work arrangements as the most important attribute beyond compensation and job security.\n\nThe world of work has changed compared to even six months ago. Leaders are starting to believe that the enterprise of tomorrow may not be able to run with yesterday\u2019s talent \u2013 and tomorrow\u2019s talent may not be able be rely on yesterday\u2019s ways of working.\n\nHR leaders can play a critical role in how organizations adapt to the changes driven by generative AI. These leaders can be at the helm of navigating these challenges, redesigning work and operating models to shepherd their organizations into the future. Here are a few actions to consider.\n\nRedesign the work, leading with the operating model. Automating bad processes won\u2019t make them better. Rather than automating the same activities you\u2019ve always done, go back to the drawing board to find a better way forward. Process mining can analyze how work is done and where bottlenecks or other inefficiencies exist. From there, you can re-think and re-engineer how work gets done, identifying tasks where AI or automation can be applied to free up employee time for higher value tasks where their touch is critical. For example, IBM\u2019s HR team re-examined the highly manual and data-intensive quarterly promotions process, applying a custom watsonx Orchestrate solution to automate data gathering and thereby empowering human staff to devote more time to high-value tasks.\n\nInvest in talent as much as technology, preparing the workforce for AI and other technology disruption. This is a pivotal moment for HR leaders to step up to help define the organization\u2019s transformation strategy and how people\u2014and AI\u2014will combine to deliver it. HR leaders will drive workforce planning, design and strategy like defining higher-value work, identifying the critical roles and skills of the future and managing hiring, shifting people into new roles, retention and more. That can include reviewing roles, identifying and eliminating repetitive tasks that can be handled by AI, merging roles to create new roles, expanding roles to include tasks like applying or managing AI tools, and creating targeted skill development for the higher-level tasks driven by people.\n\nPut skills at the center of workforce strategy\u2014for today and for tomorrow. Leaders should be thinking about how to increase the overall technical acumen of the workforce. That can serve as a broad foundation upon which employees build new skills, such as how to work creatively and responsibly with AI. That doesn\u2019t mean every employee will have to learn how to code\u2013but most will have to familiarize themselves with new AI solutions. It\u2019s very important for employees to have a basic understanding of AI and its capabilities so they can be both critical thinkers and users of the technology. Everyone should be empowered to ask questions about models\u2019 training data, how it came to its predictions, potential biases and more. Technology can help with skills and career development too. Interactive career roadmaps with dynamic prompts can help employees see what\u2019s expected for them to progress. At Delta Airlines, IBM Consulting implemented a skills foundation and a talent platform that enabled their IT workforce to upskill into critical new technologies. The future pipeline of talent is an important consideration too. The global AI skills gap is an urgent need facing many companies today across industries, and this will require strategic investments.\n\nGive jobs more meaning by putting the employee in the driver\u2019s seat. AI has the potential to transform the employee experience. It can automate repetitive tasks, letting people focus on what they are passionate about, freeing up their time for skills development or work-life balance, and potentially create exciting new job roles and career paths. It\u2019s important to engage employees in this process. For example, give teams a forum to recommend tasks that could be automated to make their jobs easier and more fulfilling, leveraging digital channels for a continuous and open feedback loop. This kind of openness to feedback and company-wide growth mindset can also help develop your next generation of leaders. Cultivate an environment where leaders at all levels are encouraged to bring new ideas and creatively apply technology within their roles.\n\nWe\u2019re at a pivotal point in the world of work and there\u2019s a massive opportunity in front of HR leaders, but there are risks as well. As businesses further embrace AI, successful change will only come if organizations\u2014by way of HR leaders\u2014prioritize a new approach to talent and operating models where people and technology come together to boost productivity and drive business value.",

        "text": "Executives in Singapore and globally believe that 40 per cent of their employees will need to reskill due to the growing use of AI and automation over the next three years, the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBM IBV) has found.\n\nAccording to World Bank estimates, with 3.4 billion people in the world\u2019s labour force, this could mean that 1.4 billion people may need to be retrained.\n\nThe most urgent problems for Singaporean executives, according to the IBM institute study, are the availability of external capabilities and developing new skills for existing talent. Investing in reskilling is preferred by respondents (62 per cent), as opposed to hiring from outside (38 per cent).\n\nThis research by the IBM institute finds that talent-related challenges emerge as AI becomes more pervasive in business. These include a skills gap, shifting employee expectations, and the need for new operating models.\n\nGenerative AI\n\nGenerative AI might raise that number even further. A recent survey by IBM IBV found that four out of five CEOs believe that generative AI would alter the responsibilities and abilities of employees.\n\nWhile all employees will be affected by generative AI, lower-level workers are anticipated to experience the most change.\n\nThe study finds that 77 per cent of U.S. executive respondents from multinational companies claim entry-level positions are already experiencing those effects, compared to only 22 per cent of those surveyed who said the same for executive or senior management roles.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI is driving massive shifts in employee roles and skills, especially those in entry-level,\u201d said Ng Lai Yee, manager partner of IBM Consulting, Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe focus on skills is, however, not enough as true progress requires reimagining work itself,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise of tomorrow cannot run with yesterday\u2019s talent, and it\u2019s time to prepare the workforce for new applications of AI,\u201d she noted.\n\n\u201cCombining human expertise and knowledge of complex business processes with AI tools will enable companies to create new opportunities and accomplish business outcomes faster than before,\u201d she argued.\n\nWhat matters most at work\n\nThe report also found a gulf between employers and workers regarding what matters most at work.\n\nSince AI is set to take on more manual and repetitive tasks, 46 per cent of employees in the Asia-Pacific region say that doing impactful work is the top concern they have, above pay and job security, flexible work schedules, career advancement opportunities, and financial equity.\n\nHowever, employers have not recognised this fact. Impactful work was considered as the least significant factor by CEOs polled in Singapore, who instead identified flexible work schedules and transparent performance measurements as the most crucial qualities above pay and job security.\n\nIn similar findings, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts that 44 per cent of workers\u2019 skills will be disrupted between 2023 and 2028, a figure that has increased by nine per cent from its last five-year projection.\n\nWEF predicts that new technologies will disrupt 85 million jobs globally between 2020 and 2025\u2014and create 97 million new job roles.",

        "text": "Upskilling enhances and broadens an individual\u2019s skills while reskilling involves acquiring new skills for a different job or career. In this era of automation, both upskilling and reskilling have become crucial since they allow workers to adjust to evolving technologies and job demands.\n\nPeople often use the term \u201cfuture of work,\u201d I believe a significant portion of that future has already arrived. Automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly impactful in many industries. As technology advances, many jobs will become automated, and new roles will require new skills and knowledge. ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs), and sustainability are the latest emerging skills.\n\nIn most cases, these technologies, knowledge, and capabilities are so new or change rapidly that organizations cannot acquire them through talent alone. This shift is creating a growing need for upskilling and reskilling to ensure workers can stay relevant and competitive in the job market. While some businesses approach these new trends skeptically and hesitate to adapt, they should seize the opportunity. The World Economic Forum found that by 2023, 1 billion people will be equipped with the skills needed for the future.\n\nThe fear and mistrust of AI are understandable, given the portrayal of AI in iconic sci-fi movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, War Games, and others, which dramatize AI failures and the ultimate triumph of humanity. However, these are fictional portrayals. There\u2019s no need to battle against AI; instead, we should view AI as a new team member that augments human innovation. AI can handle tasks that are too tedious, voluminous, complex, or impractical for humans. With AI, we can accomplish more and concentrate on tasks that demand human creativity and expertise.\n\nAccording to an MIT study, workers using ChatGPT reported a 37% increase in productivity. AI can complement our work, but it shouldn\u2019t be seen as a replacement for the human workforce. We can better understand this by prioritizing learning at work and encouraging employees to actively learn about automation instead of fearing it. Business leaders can utilize AI to invest in their employees by providing upskilling and reskilling opportunities, increasing retention, improving employee satisfaction, and filling skills gaps.\n\nThe Importance of Reskilling and Upskilling in an AI-Driven Work Environment\n\nReskilling involves learning new skills to adapt to new job requirements while upskilling enhances existing skills to improve performance in the current job.\n\nThere are several reasons why reskilling and upskilling are important in an AI-driven workplace:\n\nStaying competitive: Workers with the latest skills are more likely to be hired and promoted.\n\nIncreasing job satisfaction: Engaged workers are more satisfied with their jobs.\n\nImproving productivity: Skilled workers are more efficient.\n\nReducing the risk of job displacement: Adaptable workers are less likely to be replaced by automation.\n\nUpskilling and reskilling are important as they can lead to higher wages and better job opportunities. Workers with new skills or knowledge are often more valuable to employers and can command higher salaries. Additionally, workers with diverse skills are more attractive to potential employers due to their broader range of experience and expertise.\n\nBoosting retention: Employees value businesses that support their growth. According to LinkedIn\u2019s 2023 Workplace Learning Report, the opportunity to learn and acquire new skills significantly influences job considerations. Moreover, Gallup\u2019s American Upskilling Study found that nearly half of Americans (48%) would switch jobs for skills training opportunities.\n\nReskilling and upskilling are crucial in the face of the AI-driven workplace revolution. As technology rapidly advances, adapting to new roles (reskilling) and enhancing existing competencies (upskilling) become essential. Embracing AI, such as ChatGPT and large language models, is critical, as studies demonstrate significant productivity gains.\n\nReskilling and upskilling meet the demands of the evolving job market and cultivate a culture of continuous learning, positioning individuals and organizations for success in the AI-driven landscape. The future has arrived, and through strategic skill development, we can confidently embrace opportunities and navigate challenges in the ever-evolving world of work.\n\nMike Szczesny is the owner and vice president of EDCO Awards & Specialties, a dedicated supplier of employee recognition products, crystal trophy, branded merchandise, and athletic awards.

        "text": "In 2019, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted that within 15 to 20 years, new automation technologies would likely eliminate 14% of the world\u2019s jobs and radically transform 32% of them. Those sobering numbers, involving more than 1 billion people globally, didn\u2019t even account for the sudden ascent of generative AI .\n\nAdvances in technologies are rapidly changing the demand for skills. Increasingly, technology is handling repetitive and manual tasks and even sophisticated knowledge-based work\u2014such as research, coding, and writing\u2014long considered safe from disruption. But the average half-life of skills is now less than five years\u2014and half that in some tech fields. Many knowledge workers will discover that AI and other new technologies have altered what they do. They will effectively be working in completely new fields.\n\nTo cope with these disruptions, many organizations are investing heavily in upskilling their workforces, devoting as much as 1.5% of revenue to learning and development. But more and more, these programs will have to both upskill employees and reskill them for new roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe need for a reskilling revolution is apparent. What must companies do to make it happen? In collaboration with Harvard University\u2019s Digital Reskilling Lab, we interviewed leaders at almost 40 organizations around the world that are investing in large-scale reskilling programs . We observed five success factors that companies must address to thrive in the rapidly evolving era of automation and AI .\n\nReskilling Is a Strategic Imperative\n\nDuring times of disruption, when many jobs are threatened, companies have often turned to reskilling to soften the blow of layoffs, act in accordance with social responsibility commitments, and create a positive PR narrative. But most of the leaders we spoke with have moved beyond that narrow approach and now recognize reskilling as a strategic imperative. That shift reflects profound changes in the labor market, which is increasingly constrained by the aging of the working population, the emergence of new occupations, and a growing need for employees to develop company-specific skills.\n\nInfosys, for example, has reskilled more than 2,000 cybersecurity experts to acquire adjacent competencies. Vodafone aims to draw from internal talent to fill 40% of its software developer needs. And Amazon, through its Machine Learning University, has enabled thousands of employees inexperienced in machine learning to become experts in the field.\n\nReskilling Is the Responsibility of Every Leader and Manager\n\nTraditionally, reskilling has been considered part of the overall corporate-learning function siloed within HR. Investments in reskilling need a profound commitment from HR leaders, of course, but unless the rest of the organization understands the strategic relevance of those investments, it\u2019s very hard to generate the effort that reskilling initiatives require to succeed.\n\nAt most of our interviewees\u2019 organizations, reskilling initiatives are visibly championed by senior leaders, often CEOs and chief operating officers. They work hard to articulate for the rest of the company the connection between reskilling and strategy and to ensure that leadership and management teams understand their shared responsibility in implementing these programs.\n\nEricsson, for example has developed a multiyear strategy devoted to upskilling and reskilling telecommunications experts to become AI and data science experts. Senior leaders review key results of the program quarterly. In just three years, Ericsson has upskilled more than 15,000 employees in AI and automation.\n\nSubscribe to our People Strategy E-Alert.\n\nReskilling Is a Change Management Initiative\n\nTo design and implement ambitious reskilling programs, companies must do more than just train employees. They must develop a winning organizational ethos by creating the right mindset and behaviors among employees and managers. In other words, reskilling is a complex change management initiative that requires a simultaneous focus on many different tasks: understanding supply and demand, recruiting and evaluating employees, training middle managers, learning skills on the job, and matching reskilled employees with new jobs.\n\nEmployees Want to Reskill\u2014When It Makes Sense\n\nMany of the leaders we spoke with mentioned that one of their biggest challenges is persuading employees to reskill. But workers may be more willing to engage in reskilling than executives think. Two-thirds of workers are aware of the coming disruption in their fields and are willing to reskill to remain competitively employed. Our interviews suggest that companies that treat their workers respectfully and lay out the benefits of reskilling initiatives will have an easier time. As one of our interviewees explained, \u201cThe secret to scaling up reskilling programs is to design a product your employees actually like.\u201d\n\nReskilling Takes a Village\n\nCompanies have tended to think of reskilling as a challenge they must overcome by themselves. But many of the companies we looked at recognize that reskilling requires partners. Governments can incentivize reskilling investments; industries can team up with universities to develop new skill-building techniques; and NGOs can connect corporate talent needs with disadvantaged and marginalized populations. Coalitions of companies may be more effective at meeting the reskilling challenge than individual organizations on their own.\n\nMany companies understand the need to embrace reskilling, but they have been hampered by a lack of rigor in measuring and evaluating what actually works and by a lack of understanding about how to scale reskilling programs. In today\u2019s rapidly changing environment, companies will have to develop new ways to learn that are systematic, rigorous, experimental, and durable. Only then will the reskilling revolution really take off.\n\nRead more on this topic in Harvard Business Review .",

In Cyprus, AI is reshaping workplaces, offering \u201cAI is already reshaping workplaces, promising better salaries, and increased opportunities,\u201d particularly in sectors like financial services, healthcare, and automotive, according to Skourides.\n\nAccording to a survey by tech consultancy Access Partnership and Amazon Web Services, workers with AI skills are expected to see at least a 30 per cent increase in pay.\n\nAccording to Skourides, \u201cAI is becoming an emerging career path, as seen by the rise in positions within companies such as AWS, Meta, Google, and others across Europe.\u201d\n\nAI\u2019s ability to increase productivity through automation, optimise decision-making with advanced analytical tools, and drive innovation in products and services is expected to boost sectors like financial services, healthcare and automotive, potentially contributing up to $13 trillion globally by 2030, according to a recent analysis by McKinsey & Company.\n\n\u201cCypriot companies, particularly in financial services, can ride on this wave of growth,\u201d Skourides added.\n\nHowever, digitization levels in both the public and private sectors in Cyprus are much lower compared to other developed countries.\n\nIn 2021, 70 per cent of Cypriot SMEs had at least a basic level of digital intensity, 42.3 per cent used social media, and 42.2 per cent cloud storage.\n\nSkourides said tha\u201dt the use of e-invoices remained low (13.1 per cent), and cutting-edge technologies were underutilised,\u201d adding that \u201cwith only 6.2 per cent of businesses using big data and a mere 2.6 per cent leveraging AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis lag represents a significant opportunity,\u201d Skourides said.\n\n\u201cUniversity graduates returning to Cyprus with STEM degrees, or for students pursuing new ambitious AI specialisation programmes in Cypriot universities, particularly in fields such as the environment, energy, and critical infrastructures,\u201d Skourides explained.\n\nHe also noted that workers already in the job market, especially support engineers who invest in AI skills, can expect salary increases of up to 30 per cent, supported by government incentives.\n\nHe explained that Cyprus\u2019 AI strategy is expected to attract innovation-driven companies and multinationals, while boosting productivity and revenues across industries such as healthcare, retail, hospitality, financial services, gaming, adtech and martech.\n\nTo achieve this transformation, Cyprus needs a detailed strategy to turn employees into active stakeholders in value creation.\n\nSkourides pointed out that the government is already providing subsidised and free of charge training programmes through the Human Resource Development Authority.\n\nMoreover, he noted that local universities are offering scholarships for bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees, focused on AI. Affordable online training resources, such as Coursera.org, Udemy, LinkedIn, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, and Google AI, are also widely available.\n\nFurthermore, one instance of AI\u2019s impact in Cyprus is the Hackathon event held in Limassol, focusing on financial services.\n\n\u201cParticipants developed applications aimed at making these services more accessible, efficient, and responsive,\u201d Skourides said.\n\nAdditionally, the Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) launched an initiative where seven RIF teams developed 20 proposals to improve productivity, save time, and enhance customer service.\n\n\u201cThis initiative highlights RIF\u2019s commitment to promoting innovation and integrating cutting-edge technologies into its processes, while fostering employee collaboration and creativity,\u201d Skourides explained.\n\nRIF has also established an \u201cAI Taskforce\u201d team to explore the ethical dimensions of AI in the workplace.\n\n\u201cThe task force aims to address concerns about job loss and data privacy, ensuring that AI applications are transparent, fair, and accountable. The task force is comprised of five highly qualified employees tasked with monitoring these practices,\u201d he noted.\n\nAs companies and organisations navigate this technological revolution, it\u2019s important to understand the multifaceted impact of AI on productivity, employee engagement, and organizational culture.\n\n\u201cOrganizational leaders must recognise that AI is not just a technological upgrade, but a paradigm shift that requires active participation and engagement,\u201d according to Skourides.\n\nEY\u2019s analysis shows that AI can \u201ccomplement human capabilities rather than replace them,\u201d allowing employees to focus on more strategic and creative tasks.\n\nSkourides stressed that Cyprus must adopt a holistic AI strategy to fully realise its benefits. This involves transforming employees into active participants in value creation while ensuring continuous learning and development.\n\n\u201cBy focusing on enhancing human capabilities and fostering a culture of collaboration and transparency, organizations can fully leverage AI\u2019s potential, creating a more dynamic and resilient workforce,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOver the next few years, businesses should identify areas where AI can reduce operational expenses and improve customer experience, invest in employee training, and consistently assess their digital maturity and AI adoption,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t miss the opportunity to become one of Cyprus\u2019 fastest-growing companies,\u201d Skourides concluded.",

It is something you come across during shopping, on the internet, on phones; basically, everything that has to do with technology. AI helps in many capacities; hence, it is changing the world in numerous ways. Here are the benefits of artificial intelligence:\n\n1. No partial decisions\n\nOne of the most outstanding benefits of artificial intelligence is that it doesn\u2019t make partial decisions, unlike human beings, who get engulfed in their emotions. AI has been programmed to make unbiased decisions, providing accuracy and fairness in various tasks.\n\n2. Eliminates risk\n\nArtificial intelligence, such as robots, can help eliminate difficult or risky tasks. For instance, machines are built to detect danger or perform in any manufacturing company to help with human miscalculation or error and achieve perfection.\n\n3. Helps in everyday applications\n\nAI is present in the applications you use on your phone, laptop, or computer and, of course, on the internet. Searching Google for something, taking pictures, making calls and emails, and using Google maps to inquire about destinations are all based on artificial intelligence. The benefit of all these is that you can instantly get what you want or need without worrying about how it works.\n\n4. Enhances medications\n\nArtificial intelligence has made a significant impact on medicine. From diagnosis to treatment to drug discoveries, they are all groundbreaking. AI provides better ways of getting information about patients and enhances medical technologies. For instance, AI can identify breast cancer and scan and analyze patients\u2019 genetic histories.\n\nRead Also: On artificial intelligence\n\n5. Doesn\u2019t take breaks\n\nAI performs multiple tasks at a time without any breaks. In other words, it does not need any time off to work efficiently; you only get instant responses. For example, online chatbots of a company that can reply to your questions and resolve issues for as many people as possible.\n\n6. Ability to detect fraud\n\nAnother benefit of artificial intelligence is its ability to detect fraudulent activities by analysing and identifying unusual transactions, especially in a financial institution, whereby AI is used to combat misappropriation and prevent unauthorised tasks.\n\n7. Provides customer satisfaction\n\nAll the recommendations you experience on the internet, apps, and social media come from AI. It already understands you, your search history and what interests you. Through these, it suggests different products or services to you that are similar to the ones you\u2019ve watched or searched for. It could be on a browser or a streaming platform.\n\n8. Enhances work productivity\n\nAI can enhance the work productivity of an organization or company by prioritising the most important tasks with deadlines, organising meetings and assisting with workloads. All these make day-to-day work faster and easier.",

        "text": "Late last year, a leading state technology official warned that without good data state and local governments risk making artificial intelligence tools \u201cstupid,\u201d merely a conduit for \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d\n\nBut to have good quality data, the public workforce needs good data literacy skills. As governments continue to churn out policies, guidelines and best practices for AI\u2019s use in government, training and upskilling the workforce will be just as crucial.\n\nIn its May 2023 Future of Jobs Report, the World Economic Forum found that companies rank AI and big data as a top training priority from now until 2027, especially for those companies with more than 50,000 employees.\n\n\u201cAmong technology skills, the ability to efficiently use AI tools now exceeds computer programming by humans, networks and cybersecurity skills, general technological literacy skills, and design and user experience by some margin,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe forum, in particular, found that the public sector lags far behind other sectors of the economy, both in its plans to adopt AI technologies and to prioritize training in AI and big data.\n\nOne reason governments may be slow to adopt AI and prioritize training is fear. New Jersey Chief Innovation Officer Beth Noveck warned last fall of the challenge that states and localities face as they try to promote data skills among their employees.\n\n\u201cWe all understand from a policy perspective, the importance of data and evidence, you know, basing decisions on data, but it doesn't mean any of us learned how to work with data,\u201d she said at October\u2019s Google Public Sector Forum.\n\nOne way to overcome these fears, Noveck said, is to make AI accessible. Successful AI training must include \u201cexamples and references that will make sense\u201d to staff in their daily work. She even suggested that the best way for employees to learn about AI is to experiment with it themselves, especially by using publicly available generative AI tools like ChatGPT at home.\n\nGetting employees more confident in using AI tools is important because \u201cthe lines between IT and business continue to blur,\u201d said Orla Daly, chief information officer at Skillsoft, an online training company.\n\nGovernments don\u2019t just need to hire data analysts, but to train employees to work as business analysts and data architects. Public sector employees at-large will need to have the skill to map the relevant data to the business functions they serve in government, to work out what information is consumed and then how it\u2019s delivered back to agencies and the public that uses it, said Dean Johnson, a senior executive government advisor at Ensono, an IT service management company.\n\nData mapping in such a way can feel like \u201cthreading the needle,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe best way to get employees mapping how the data fits with agencies\u2019 needs is through hands-on training, Daly said. She cited Skillsoft\u2019s 18th annual IT Skills and Salary Report, which found that across industries, only 15% of IT professionals said management did not see a tangible benefit from training, as opposed to 45% the previous year. Upskilling and reskilling\u2014not just hiring data analysts\u2014is key, she said, in getting employees comfortable using data for generative AI.\n\n\u201cThis isn't something you can necessarily buy your way out of,\u201d Daly said.\n\nIn addition to training, reskilling and upskilling employees to handle the vast amounts of data at their disposal, governments will also need more workers to help comply with the myriad data protection and state-level privacy laws, as well as federal laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\nAnd ensuring AI is used ethically, with potential biases kept front-of-mind, will be key as well. Daly said governance to provide guardrails for some of these problems will be a \u201ccontinued focus,\u201d and will need people to become adept in the ethical use of AI.\n\nThe potential for generative AI-driven misinformation and disinformation is troubling for government leaders, especially as they reckon with how the technology can experience so-called \u201challucinations\u201d and produce incorrect results. Training both the systems and the employees that leverage them will be crucial in helping reduce instances of bad information to almost zero.\n\n\u201cEighty percent or 90% [success], that might be good for basketball shooting and baseball hitting and those kinds of things,\u201d said Dekalb County, GA CIO John Matelski during a webinar hosted by the National Association of Counties last year. \u201cBut when we're talking about services and constituents and those kinds of things, that 10-20% that might not be accurate can be really devastating and embarrassing.\u201d",

This emphasis on meaningful contributions to the workplace highlights the evolving nature of employment and the desire for employees to find value in their roles.\n\nIBM Malaysia's managing director and technology leader, Catherine Lian, emphasised the significance of addressing this gap in perceptions, stating: \"Bridging this gap will be crucial in ensuring that AI and automation are harnessed in a way that enables employees to redirect their time and energy to impactful work within the organisation.\"\n\nThe roadmap for change\n\nThe research not only sheds light on the current state of job roles, skills and work processes, but also offers valuable recommendations for leaders grappling with talent challenges in an AI-dominated era.\n\nAmong these recommendations, a prominent focus on skills and operating models is advocated.\n\nIt highlights the need for organisations to prioritise reskilling and upskilling initiatives, providing their workforce with the tools and knowledge to adapt to the evolving technological landscape.\n\nMoreover, the report underscores the importance of refining operating models to align with the transformative potential of AI, enabling organisations to remain competitive and resilient in the face of change.\n\nImperative to resell and adapt\n\nIn conclusion, as AI and automation become increasingly integrated into the Malaysian workforce, the imperative to reskill and adapt is undeniable.\n\n\"Malaysian businesses are embracing the challenge by investing in their employees, recognising the value of internal talent development.\n\n\"The divide between employer and employee perspectives underscores the importance of fostering meaningful work in an AI-driven world,\" said Lian.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAs the AI revolution rolls along, employers are looking at what skills their future workforces will need, and how to get from here to there.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a few companies here and there: it\u2019s just about the entire working world. According to a recent report from PeopleScout and Spotted Zebra, about 90% of HR leaders believe that up to half their workforce will need to be reskilled in the next five years.\n\nBut what does that actually mean? It depends on the company and the work that needs to be done, but whatever the process, it\u2019s important for employers to keep the employee in mind. That means communicating to them what this future holds, addressing any fears and making sure they\u2019re getting the skills they need as AI adoption continues, experts said.\n\n\u201cWhen we introduced machinery into agriculture a couple of centuries ago, it changed the work within the farm from one day to the next,\u201d said Helen Poitevin, distinguished VP analyst in Gartner\u2019s human resources practice. \u201cLook at how AI gets introduced in just about every industry, in every workflow. It\u2019s very incremental.\u201d\n\nTeaching employees how to work with AI\n\nPart of that reskilling is helping employees work alongside AI, especially now as it starts to enter more parts of daily life. According to a 2023 Gartner survey, 79% of functional leaders will begin or continue to implement generative AI across the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cWhen you introduce AI into the way people are working, there\u2019s an immediate need for learning the new ways of working,\u201d said Poitevin.\n\nWith that comes addressing fear surrounding the technology, whether concerns about the technology itself, working with it, or that it will be taking their jobs \u2014 a fear that\u2019s not unfounded as, in the same Gartner report, leaders said they expect generative AI to reduce head counts between about six and 10 percent.\n\nJust making workers are aware of AI, and the opportunities it offers, \u201cis very low impact, but it\u2019s very easy to do,\u201d Poitevin said.\n\nHow \u2014 and who \u2014 to upskill\n\nBecause the technology is still new, and these changes are incremental, it might not be obvious what kind of reskilling employees will need, said Poitevin. It\u2019s important for employers to \u201cset themselves up to monitor and capture the cases where jobs don\u2019t make sense anymore, so they can be redesigned.\u201d\n\nEmployers can shift from \u201cthinking about what jobs will go away\u201d to thinking instead about the work that will need to be done, she added.\n\nHR managers should not be identifying current employees for upskilling \u2014 or job candidates \u2014 solely based on technical know-how, because that\u2019s not necessarily needed to learn new skills to work with AI, said Steve West, head of global talent acquisition at Verizon. \u201cIt\u2019s a behavioral element of having the ability to learn, and coachability, that you can adapt to using these new ways of working and not necessarily have to be a programmer to code AI,\u201d he said.\n\nIt's also important to keep the person at the center of the process, and consider why this is good for them first. \u201cWe\u2019re not upskilling people just to upskill them. We\u2019re upskilling them to ultimately make them better to make us better,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are skill areas that are going to be delivering or critical capabilities to drive our strategy.\u201d\n\nEmployees want to be reskilled, if employers help them\n\nActively working with employees can also set an employer apart. That same PeopleScout and Spotted Zebra report found that only 7% of HR leaders noted an active investment in their reskilling program, and 45% said they had no plans to undertake a workforce transformation initiative.\n\n\u201cSkills-based talent strategies are essential, and the clock is ticking for employers across all regions and industries,\u201d Nick Shaw, founder and chief customer officer of Spotted Zebra, said in a statement. \u201cWithout future-focused skills strategies for both hiring and development, organizations will suffer lost revenue and productivity when critical jobs are left unfilled.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the reality that is coming, and preparing workers for it, also can be important in retaining talent. \u201cPretending like it\u2019s not happening is never good. You can diminish trust,\u201d said Poitevin. \u201cBut also encouraging people to focus on what\u2019s to be done and seek out the opportunities in using AI to help make a difference or to work in different ways is key.\u201d",

By 2030, plans call for half of new car sales to be electric \u2014 making millions of roles redundant and creating the need for millions more.\n\nWelcome to the brave new labor market. As technology advances at an ever-faster clip, seemingly no job is safe. Generative AI has only quickened the pace, leaving organizations scrambling. Some workplace roles are becoming obsolete in the course of months, not years, while new ones are constantly emerging.\n\nFor companies, keeping up with these changes calls for a dramatic shift in mindset: Goodbye jobs, hello skills.\n\nBusinesses have traditionally managed talent by fixating on rigid job descriptions. But hiring and firing based on ever-changing roles is proving increasingly problematic. So progressive employers are taking a skills-based approach instead \u2014 reconceiving employees as a bundle of malleable skills rather than a fixed role.\n\nThat assembly line worker may specialize in building gas engines, for instance. Under the hood, however, they likely have a basket of hundreds or even thousands of skills that may be just as applicable in the EV setting.\n\nSkills are more granular and harder to track \u2014 but for today's employers and workers, they're far more useful than roles that may not exist tomorrow. When German industrial giant Henkel set out to upskill its workforce, for instance, it uncovered a repertoire of 52,000 skills, many of which were highly relevant in an increasingly digital economy.\n\nThe challenges (and rewards) of taking a skills-based approach to talent cross nearly all sectors. Unfortunately, many organizations are flying blind when it comes to what skills they're missing, how certain skills drive business results and what reskilling and upskilling programs they need.\n\nAs co-founder of an HR tech firm that helps organizations use people data to look at their business through a skills lens, I've seen what powerful results it can deliver for companies and their workers. Here are three key steps to move from roles to skills.\n\nRelated: Tap Into These 4 Hiring Trends to Achieve Your Goals\n\nStep 1: Understand the skills you already have\n\nWhen a company says it's in \"hiring mode,\" I immediately get suspicious. Boosting headcount might sound like a logical move \u2014 but often, it's putting jobs before skills. A smarter approach: Start with the business problem and ask, Can our existing talent base solve it?\n\nUnilever went that route by launching an internal talent marketplace that lets workers bring their skills wherever they're needed. The company unlocked 700,000 hours to devote to some 3,000 projects, shrinking its need for new hires. Oh, and productivity climbed more than 40%.\n\nUsing people analytics, organizations can take a systematic approach to understanding their talent base. Create a comprehensive catalog of skills. Match them against roles to identify gaps. The payoff: informed choices about whether to reskill, reassign or hire people. Even better, the skills gleaned become the centerpiece of internal and external job postings.\n\nCompanies might be able to spot skills gaps at a high level, but their grasp of details is often fuzzy at best. In one survey, almost 90% of organizations recognized they had a skills gap problem or expected one within five years. But a clear picture of current skills or what roles likely faced disruption? On that front, more than half of companies were in the dark.\n\nStep 2: Understand the skills you'll need tomorrow\n\nJust as important as understanding what skills you have is understanding what skills will be needed in the years ahead. Without an intentional approach here, it's easy to get caught off guard \u2014 even in forward-looking sectors.\n\nFor instance, more than 250,000 U.S. technology workers were let go in 2023 \u2014 a 50% surge over the previous year. Along with countless startups, even giants like Amazon, Google and Meta are feeling the pain. Could they have avoided such a purge?\n\nYes, by leaning on the emerging field of skills-based workforce planning. By turning to experts who classify what skills are waxing and waning in particular industries, companies can plan ahead to have the right number of people for the right tasks.\n\nA growing number of skills-based platforms use predictive models to peer into the future \u2014 anticipating, for instance, that demand for AI collaboration skills will climb in years ahead, while demand for traditional coding skills will drop. It's far from an exact science. But skills vendors can make educated guesses about how technology and other factors will change how people work. That foresight is increasingly important as AI lays waste to entire job categories.\n\nRelated: Why You Should Hire for Potential, Not Experience\n\nStep 3: Reskill and upskill employees to get there\n\nTo get the most out of a skills-based approach, it's critical to embrace reskilling and upskilling rather than simply firing and hiring. Take PepsiCo, which in 2022 launched an academy that offers its 300,000 workers free training in digital skills. More than 11,000 employees signed on during the first year, earning certifications such as data scientist and site reliability engineer.\n\nWalmart recently launched a partnership with an online education provider that will offer its 1.5 million U.S. employees free courses in data analytics, software development and data-driven strategic thinking. Through its $2.1 billion Upskilling 2025 programs, Amazon is giving 300,000 workers access to education and skills training.\n\nSimilar reskilling and upskilling efforts are popping up at businesses large and small. That's driving a boom in learning and development platforms, which make it easy for companies to create programs that suit their needs.\n\nEmployees want those programs. When my company surveyed workers, almost 60% said they rely on employer-led skills development for career growth. Nearly 9 in 10 employees said their employer should play some role in reskilling so they aren't easily replaced by AI.\n\nWhat's the ROI from putting skills front and center?\n\nThe benefits of taking a skills-based approach to developing talent aren't hard to see. When Deloitte surveyed businesses about human capital trends, almost 95% said moving away from a focus on jobs is a key success factor for them.\n\nBesides doing a better job of matching people with what needs to be done, skills-based companies are more efficient and competitive. Nimble enough to adapt to change, they can evolve instead of stagnating in the old, roles-based way of doing things.\n\nRelated: Why Skills Shouldn't Be Just a P.S. on a Resume\n\nWant proof? Skills-based organizations are more than twice as likely to place talent effectively, 57% more likely to anticipate and respond effectively to change, and 52% more likely to innovate. Among the other rewards: a bigger and more diverse hiring pool, better candidates, lower recruiting costs and greater employee loyalty and retention.\n\nWill traditional job roles disappear as employees increasingly become skills repositories? I don't see that happening anytime soon. After all, roles are an easy and useful shorthand for describing what people do. But with help from people analytics, forward-looking companies will learn to see roles as a far more fluid collection of competencies \u2014 underpinned by skills that can be adapted to a changing job climate.",

        "text": "Workers today are being urged to constantly reskill. Artificial intelligence favours certain new skills while making others redundant, but it\u2019s not that simple to choose what to invest in. Fabian Stephany and Ole Teutloff reveal that complementarity \u2013 the degree to which skills can be combined \u2013 is key to understanding the economic value of a particular skill.\n\nCan we keep up with AI? The question of whether we will be \u201cracing against or with machines\u201d has been a prominent one in recent years. AI and other digital technologies have started to reshape industries, rendering some jobs obsolete while creating entirely new ones. This constant transformation demands that workers and organisations adapt to the changing landscape of work. Technological advancements, especially in fields like AI (think ChatGPT or Dall-E), bring forth new opportunities, but they also create a pressing need for specific skills.\n\nThe pace of technological and social change has quickly outstripped the ability of national training systems and employers to keep up. Workers therefore find themselves at a crossroads, uncertain about which skills will secure their future. This dilemma is further complicated for those who have already invested in their current skill sets and who have limited resources to embark on entirely new career paths. The global workforce is urged to constantly reskill, as technological change favours particular new skills while making others redundant. But which skills should workers and firms be investing in?\n\nComplementarity: the key to a skill\u2019s value\n\nTo address this question, we analysed a decade\u2019s-worth of skill profiles of around 25,000 knowledge workers, summarised in our recent article and found that complementarity is the key to determining the value of a skill. Complementarity refers to how well a skill complements and enhances other skills. Here\u2019s why it matters:\n\nSkill sets : Rarely do we apply a skill in isolation. Most jobs require a combination of skills. Therefore, the value of a skill can only be assessed in the context of its complementary skills. Reskilling efficiency : As workers adapt to new technologies, they incrementally add new skills to their existing skill sets. Maximising complementarity between old and new skills is crucial for economic efficiency in this process. Strategic value : As a particular skill\u2019s set of complementary skills becomes more diverse, the more strategic options a worker has for reskilling. This increases their resilience against unforeseen technological changes in the future.\n\nAI skills: a valuable resource\n\nTo put our concept into practice, we focus on the skills related to AI. AI is at the forefront of technological innovation, creating new opportunities and demands for specific skills. Indeed, in our model, AI skills, such as programming languages and data analytics, have proven to be particularly valuable \u2013 increasing worker wages by 21 per cent on average \u2013 as shown in Figure 1 below. But why?\n\nFigure 1. The value of AI skills\n\n(Top) Working with AI pays off: The value of AI skills \u2013 increasing worker wages by 21% \u2013 is significantly higher than for average skills. (Bottom) When examining the value of AI skills individually, we see that skills around machine learning \u2013 that is, ML (40%), Tensor Flow (38%), Deep Learning (27%), NLP (19%) \u2013 are more valuable than skills around Data Analysis (14%) and Data Science (17%), followed by the most prominent programming languages used to build AI, like Python (8%), C++ (7%) and Java (5%). Source: Stephany and Teutloff (2023) [1].\n\nAI skills exhibit strong complementarity with various other skills, both in terms of number and diversity. This makes them highly adaptable and valuable in a variety of contexts. They have entered various fields of knowledge work, from graphic design to translation work to software development. In addition, the demand for AI skills has been on the rise in recent years. As industries across the board embrace AI, workers with AI skills are in high demand, leading to increased wages.\n\nReskilling: empowering workers and firms\n\nOur findings have profound implications for individuals, businesses, and policymakers. By recognizing the value of complementarity, we can better guide workers on their reskilling journeys. Imagine personalised skill recommendations tailored to each individual\u2019s existing skills, ensuring they are well-equipped for the future. For organisations, investing in the development of AI skills among their workforce is an investment in the future. It\u2019s a strategic move that not only boosts productivity but also future-proofs the company against technological disruptions.\n\nIn conclusion, the world of work is evolving, and adaptability is the key to success. Understanding the complementarity of skills is essential in making informed decisions about where to invest in your skill development: Learning one and the same skill might pay differently, depending on which skills you already have. Our research supports policy recommendations that advocate for personalised learning strategies \u2013 ideally carried out within firms \u2013 and more flexible certification options for competencies acquired through vocational training, short courses, or training programs. These flexible certifications, often referred to as \u201cmicro-credentials,\u201d are in high demand to ensure that both workers and employers are well-equipped to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of the future of work.",

        "text": "People professionals have the chance to design and implement a new era for work in 2024, says Mary Alice Vuicic\n\nAI continues to act as a transformative force across professional services, driving change across many distinct aspects of business, and its impact will only intensify in 2024.\n\nAs the influence of AI grows it will revolutionise the way we work, but it\u2019s also set to drive a wider transformation, whether changing traditional career paths, evolving hiring practices or leading to an evolution in job roles.\n\nWhen harnessed safely and effectively, AI has the potential to drive business innovation and profitability, as well as boosting employee satisfaction. Through it all, HR will have a critical role to play in helping to ensure that professionals thrive in the workplace of the future. So how will AI redefine work responsibilities in 2024? How important is AI skills training? And what impact will AI have on professional career paths next year?\n\nThe impact of AI will be ubiquitous\n\nGenerative AI is set to permeate all aspects of work. It will enable augmentation and automation and lead to the redefinition of roles and organisations, fostering new hybrid (human plus AI) job categories and dramatically increasing the focus on data and data quality.\n\nThe Thomson Reuters Future of Professionals Report surveyed more than 1,200 professionals to gauge their views on the future of work. In it 45 per cent of professionals said their biggest hopes for AI were improved productivity, internal efficiency and improved client services. Through these improvements they are hopeful AI will enable them to focus less on administrative tasks and more on challenging and rewarding work. Furthermore, 67 per cent of professionals said that producing high-quality advice was their most important motivator.\n\nTo continue this work in the era of generative AI, we need to reconsider and redefine what it means to be an adviser and evolve business models to prepare and serve customers for tomorrow \u2013 not just today. This means business leaders and HR have the chance to fundamentally redesign work for the better. If HR professionals can help their organisation get to grips with AI technology early on, it can bring a multitude of benefits.\n\nAs well as benefiting business growth and productivity, it can also help alleviate human capital issues such as skills shortages, tackling burnout and driving employee engagement and satisfaction across the professions.\n\nThe era of upskilling and reskilling\n\nAs AI adoption accelerates into next year, we will see an unprecedented wave of upskilling and reskilling as organisations and professionals aim to harness the opportunities provided by AI.\n\nAn employee\u2019s ability to adapt to changing work methods \u2013 AQ, the adaptability quotient \u2013 will be just as important or even more so than IQ and EQ in the AI era of work. This will be partly driven by the shifting of professional work towards higher-value activities. As AI takes on routine tasks, employees will have more time to focus on work that requires creative or strategic thinking.\n\nThe introduction of innovative new job roles can maximise AI\u2019s potential and help workers adapt to the new style of working. New roles, such as integrators \u2013 which utilise AI technology to elevate human work \u2013 and reskillers \u2013 tasked with training people for the work humans are uniquely positioned to do \u2013 can help amplify the qualities provided by both technology and human beings.\n\nTalent acquisition teams will need to adapt accordingly as the needs of professionals within the workplace change. They will need to reconsider how they hire staff, particularly for those in brand new job roles, so that new recruits can seamlessly join the team and provide real value to the business.\n\nThe empowered professional in the age of AI\n\nProfessionals are likely to assume greater responsibility for their career trajectories in the age of AI. The widespread availability of resources and online learning help increase access to important learning materials to improve employability.\n\nAI education tools and AI-driven community initiatives can help improve career prospects and cultivate a mindset of curiosity, creativity and critical thinking, which will be even more crucial in the new workplace. For instance, AI content can help users access personalised learning material or set up a specialised learning plan using AI-powered analytics to greatly expand their skillset and tailor their needs to the demands of their updated job role.\n\nPeer-to-peer learning networks and mentorship programmes will also gain in popularity as professionals seek to collaborate with others in their learning journeys to gain even more insight on how to best adapt.\n\nAs we approach the precipice of major change, HR\u2019s role, alongside AI-supported training tools, will be crucial to provide the training and mentoring needed for workers to succeed. In 2024, AI will drive a transformation in professional work. It represents a powerful opportunity for HR teams to deepen their position as trusted partners to help organisations navigate the complexities as well as the opportunities that AI will bring. By harnessing AI to help drive employee satisfaction and personal fulfilment, HR can demonstrate that it can also help companies navigate to greater long-term growth and productivity.\n\nMary Alice Vuicic is chief people officer at Thomson Reuters",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about a seismic shift in the global workforce landscape. A recent IBM AI study has shed light on the profound changes that AI is set to bring in the coming years. This article delves into the key findings of the study, exploring the implications for workers, organizations, and the future of work itself.\n\nThe Need for Reskilling: A Global Perspective\n\nAccording to the IBM AI study, about 40% of the global workforce, or roughly 1.4 billion individuals, will need to be reskilled in the next three years.\n\nWhy Reskilling?\n\nThe study emphasizes that job roles will be augmented rather than replaced by AI. This means that existing skills will need to be enhanced, and new skills developed, to keep pace with technological advancements.\n\nThe Challenge of Identifying Skills\n\nOne of the major hurdles organizations face is identifying existing skills within their teams and determining what\u2019s lacking. This process of \u201ccapturing and identifying skills\u201d is crucial for deciding where to invest in new talent or promote internal mobility.\n\nThe Benefits of Embracing AI in Reskilling\n\nOrganizations that successfully reskill their workers, with a focus on AI, report a higher growth rate of 36% than the average. This highlights the tangible benefits of embracing AI in workforce development.\n\nThe Age of the Augmented Workforce\n\nIBM\u2019s study aligns with the World Economic Forum\u2019s predictions, heralding \u201cthe age of the augmented workforce.\u201d In this era, human-machine partnerships will boost productivity and create new business value.\n\nThe Disruption and Creation of Jobs\n\nBetween 2020 and 2025, an estimated 85 million jobs globally will be disrupted, while 97 million new roles will be created. This dynamic shift underscores the importance of adaptability in the workforce.\n\nChanging Importance of Skills\n\nInterestingly, the IBM AI study found that the need for STEM skills has dropped significantly, falling from the most important in 2016 to 12th place in 2023.\n\nRise of No-Code Platforms\n\nWith the emergence of no-code software development platforms, employees without a programming background can create business-critical prototypes and apps. This has democratized technology, allowing more people to engage with it.\n\nThe Ascendance of People Skills\n\nPeople skills have surged in importance, with abilities like time management, teamwork, and effective communication rising to the top three spots. These soft skills are becoming increasingly vital in a technology-driven world.\n\nThe Importance of Impactful Work\n\nThe study emphasizes the need for companies to consider \u201cimpactful work\u201d for their employees. This factor ranks highly for workers but is often overlooked by executives, creating a potential disconnect.\n\nComparative Analysis with Other Studies\n\nThe IBM study\u2019s findings present a larger impact on workers compared to a March 2023 study by Goldman-Sachs, which estimated AI\u2019s impact to extend to 300 million workers worldwide.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe IBM AI study offers a comprehensive insight into the future of the global workforce in the age of AI. It paints a picture of a world where reskilling is not just an option but a necessity, where soft skills gain prominence, and where the human-machine partnership defines a new era of productivity and growth. The findings serve as a roadmap for organizations and individuals alike, guiding them towards a future where technology and humanity coalesce in harmony.\n\nFAQs",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving businesses to the next phase of transformation. AI is creating new value propositions that not only automate tasks for organisations but also help them become more agile and flexible. Additionally, AI lays the foundation for other innovations across the technology spectrum, whether it is in cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), or Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR). With the rapid evolution and penetration of AI, it is imperative for people, who develop and manage the technology, acquire the requisite expertise to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nToday, software and technology-driven intelligent industries require professionals to become data masters who can deduce valuable insights from the available information, making well-rounded and outcome-oriented business decisions. AI is poised to offer unique upskilling and reskilling opportunities when it comes to keeping up with today's technologies.\n\nTechnologies such as AI and ML have become crucial to an organisation\u2019s strategy, with an emphasis on fostering employee growth. Many companies are intensifying their efforts to upskill employees in areas such as cloud computing, networking fundamentals, and data management. For instance, Generative AI has already become a preferred training tool in numerous organisations, especially in the tech industry, offering upskilling programmes across diverse domains. These programmes can range from IoT to robotics and soft skills such as critical thinking.\n\nValuable feedback\n\nIndustries are leveraging AI by enabling data-driven simulations to train, upskill, and reskill employees. This approach is being adopted by manufacturing companies to offer hands-on experiences to employees, enhancing their decision-making abilities. For instance, in the automotive industry, AI-powered simulators are used to provide practical training in various scenarios such as car assembly, equipment repair, and customer inquiries. These simulators offer a realistic experience and provide valuable feedback on employee performance, helping them identify and address areas for improvement.\n\nBeyond simulation training, AI also plays a pivotal role in keeping training material updated, allowing professionals to stay informed about the latest developments in their fields. The adoption of the hybrid work model has prompted upskilling programmes to provide on-the-go solutions. In this context, mobile apps and e-learning platforms integrated with AI and ML have been gaining popularity as they give learning access anytime and anywhere.\n\nCompanies are using AI not only to upskill their current leadership but also to cultivate individuals who have the potential to assume such roles in the future. For example, the banking industry has launched AI-driven reskilling programs to prepare employees from diverse backgrounds for frontline managerial roles. These programs have a successful track record, reskilling thousands of employees each year and facilitating their transition into leadership positions.\n\nKey to building morale\n\nUpskilling and reskilling initiatives offer many benefits, boosting employee morale and cultivating a proactive mindset, ultimately leading to improved productivity. By introducing AI-based training in their strategies, companies can improve talent retention, thus, resulting in cost savings associated with recruitment. Leveraging AI, companies can also create personalised upskilling and reskilling programmes as per the roles and skillsets of employees.\n\nAI serves as a valuable tool augmenting human intelligence and ingenuity. AI\u2019s strength lies in swiftly processing and analysing vast datasets, leaving employees free to focus on other critical tasks. By reducing task completion times and improving efficiency, AI complements the efforts of a skilled workforce, resulting in a more productive and adaptable organisation.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nUpskilling and reskilling have become business imperatives over the past decade. Thanks to an AI-driven revolution today, increased efficiency and personalised training opportunities are becoming the norm. Innovative upskilling formats, such as personalised virtual learning coaches and immersive gamified learning experiences, cater to different learning styles. The future of AI in upskilling looks promising and continues to play a catalysing role in meeting the demands of a smart and evolving workforce.\n\nWith immersive and experiential upskilling opportunities, AI holds great potential to make learning more efficient, accessible, and personalised. As AI continues to advance, it will be a valuable tool in helping individuals and organisations adapt to the rapidly changing business and economic landscape.\n\n(The author is vice president, Recruitment \u2013 India, Capgemini)",

        "text": "Since Generative AI took the world by storm, GenAI has become a common topic in employee all-hands, one-on-one meetings, conferences and symposiums. It is omnipresent now. The promises and hallucinations of GenAI have progressed to the point where employees now question their relevance, job security, and future growth possibilities.\n\nAs AI automates some jobs completely and many leaders are eager to adopt AI to run their businesses more effectively, the effect on employment is visible already. According to an EY research report, a staggering 75% of employees are concerned AI will make specific jobs obsolete \u2014 and more so, about two-thirds (65%) say they are anxious about AI replacing their jobs. All this noise around AI leads to two specific questions in the minds of the confused employees: what happens to my job now, and how do I prepare for this new technology so that I am future-ready?\n\nAI anxiety in employees will cause unforeseen consequences for companies\n\nIf leaders don\u2019t answer these questions correctly, employees will migrate to places where they feel their jobs are safe or supported, otherwise known as attrition. According to a new survey by UKG, over half (54%) of employees have no idea how their companies are using AI, while 78% of C-suite leaders say their company is using AI today. With this kind of misinformation or misunderstanding, employees will start to prepare for the perceived changes independently, and the distraction will show up in their current work outputs or productivity loss.\n\nUnless leaders develop a clear point-of-view on AI and its impacts on their business, these things will be challenging to accomplish:\n\nClear communication to their employees on their plans Appropriate planning for how AI would be adapted and scaled to achieve the leaders\u2019 objectives so they can elevate their employee- and customer-value propositions Where to invest in training their employees for the AI realities Adjustment of their operating model to take advantage of the AI-powered workforce, solutions and products How to measure and govern their progress toward the set future\n\nEmployee communication is a need, not a suggestion\n\nBoth real and perceived job insecurities often motivate employees to look for other jobs. In general, leaders should attempt to maintain healthy communication with their employees to understand better and address the root causes of AI-related anxieties. Communication helps ensure the well-being of individual employees overall. It improves the organization\u2019s culture and morale, which might be more critical when AI becomes present in the workplace.\n\nCreate talent feedback loops. As AI helps to redefine work, feedback from the people who actively use it can provide crucial inputs. Regularly surveying users and managers and leveraging this insight will produce the best output. Furthermore, buy-in from the workforce is highest when employees feel they have a say and control over the use of AI-powered tools.\n\nReskilling programs will help ease AI anxiety\n\nTo have that buy-in, leaders must design AI reskilling programs from the employee\u2019s point of view. Reskilling programs in and of themselves require participants to invest a significant amount of time. As a company, you must dedicate adequate time and attention to this because reskilling involves occupational change for the employee, which typically means it requires intensive learning. Employees must feel like what they\u2019re being retrained on in terms of AI benefits their jobs. Otherwise, they will tire and not take advantage of the training as well as leaders might like.\n\nEasing AI anxiety effectively promotes more success overall\n\nIf companies act on the above, they give themselves a mechanism to address the core challenges of attrition, productivity loss and skills shortage that AI anxiety would lead to. Success measures that organizations would start to see when they properly address AI anxiety include:\n\nBetter demonstration of values in terms of cost-efficiency, improved revenue and/or productivity improvement Employee satisfaction in the categories of skills upgrade will go up Attrition should come down, and the offer acceptance rate for new employees should go up\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, leaders have been racing to capture its values for their businesses, and employees, especially the younger generation, are anxious about it. The more visionary approach is to plan for GenAI adoption and workforce transformation together; one with the other will be manageable in due course.\n\nOpinions expressed by SmartBrief contributors are their own.\n\n____________________________________\n\nTake advantage of SmartBrief\u2019s FREE email newsletters on leadership and business transformation, among the company\u2019s more than 250 industry-focused newsletters.",

While this landscape could bring opportunities for workers who learn to use new technologies, those who struggle to adapt could be replaced not by AI \u2014 but by fellow humans who know how to use it .\n\n\"AI won't take your job. It's somebody using AI that will take your job,\" economist Richard Baldwin said earlier this year.\n\nBoth scenarios point to a growing need for retraining \u2014 or reskilling \u2014 workers impacted by the coming AI boom. This includes training displaced workers for jobs less impacted by AI and giving others the skills they need to work in one of millions of new jobs that could be created due to these technologies . It also means helping workers develop AI skills in their current roles so they don't get left behind.\n\n\"Over the long term, labor disruptions could herald an unprecedented demand for reskilling displaced workers and require a significant increase in capacity for retraining,\" Seth Carpenter, Global Chief Economist for Morgan Stanley, said in a note in early November. Retraining and government safety net programs like unemployment insurance he added, are more likely to help displaced workers than policies like a universal basic income \u2014 which some have posed as a solution to AI job displacement .\n\nBut even if retraining is the solution, executing this transition is easier said than done. The US has seen job displacement before, and the aftermath hasn't always been pretty.\n\nRetraining workers in certain age groups and industries can help the US avoid the mistakes of the past\n\nIn the early 2000s, expanded global trade led to cheaper products for American consumers. But this contributed to the loss of as many as five million US manufacturing jobs and the subsequent economic hardships faced by many communities \u2014 particularly smaller cities and towns in the Midwest .\n\nWhen Donald Trump promised to bring back manufacturing jobs before the 2016 election, he was speaking to the Americans who had been left in the lurch.\n\n\"The mismanaged integration of the United States into the global economy has devastated US manufacturing workers and their communities,\" the Economic Policy Institute wrote last year, referring to the wave of globalization between 1998 and 2021.\n\nEfforts to bring supply chains closer to home have led to a manufacturing uptick in the US in recent years. But many overseas jobs aren't likely to return anytime soon, among the reasons job retraining was \u2014 and remains \u2014 necessary for impacted workers.\n\nIf and when AI poses a new disruption to many Americans' jobs, avoiding the mistakes of the past will require significant retraining investments by US companies, schools, and governments, Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute who has researched the impact of new technologies on businesses, previously told Insider.\n\nIn the \"glass-half-full\" scenario, Chui said, retraining could help many workers transition to higher-paying jobs. While the US has far from a perfect track record in navigating economic disruptions, he said he had confidence the US could make the transition.\n\n\"There was a time when a vast majority of the workers in the United States were involved in agriculture,\" he said. \"And then years later, far more people were working in factories, for instance. But we didn't end up with 50% unemployment. We have historically been able to do this.\"\n\nYoung workers, who are more likely to have experimented with technologies like ChatGPT , may have an easier time adapting to the AI future \u2014 but extra retraining resources may be needed for older workers. When telephone operators, for instance \u2014 then a common profession for women \u2014 were automated in the late 19th century, older workers struggled most, Ethan Mollick, an associate professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, told Insider .\n\n\"When you got rid of operators, then basically young women were able to adjust, find new jobs and were able to adapt,\" he said. \"But older women took a lifelong hit to wages \u2014 were never able to find as good a job again.\"\n\nCompanies, schools, and governments have a role to play in retraining\n\nOn a practical level, retraining can happen in a few different ways: at colleges and universities, through independent programs, or within companies themselves. But it's not yet clear who will be \u2014 and should be \u2014 responsible for executing the needed training.\n\nSome companies have already taken steps to ensure their workers keep up with AI.\n\nThe accounting and consulting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, for instance, has plans to provide AI training for 75,000 workers in the US and Mexico. The training is designed to teach employees about new technologies and how they can safely incorporate them into their work. In an IBM survey of 300 global corporate executives conducted in May, the executives estimated that 40% of their respective workforces would need reskilling over the next three years due to the implementation of AI and automation.\n\nIt's not just about helping workers keep their jobs. Given AI's potential to help businesses increase productivity and boost profits , there's arguably plenty of reason for them to invest in AI training.\n\nSome college professors, like UPenn's Mollick, have encouraged their students to use AI like ChatGPT in some of their studies. They say knowing how to use these tools could someday be important in the workforce . Schools and EdTech platforms have also begun offering more AI-focused courses.\n\nGovernment investments are another piece of the puzzle. In addition to directing funding toward retraining programs, Congress could also adopt tax policies that encourage companies to retrain their workers \u2014 rather than replace them.",
