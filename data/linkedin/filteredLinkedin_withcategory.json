It includes technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. AI is used in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. It powers virtual assistants, chatbots, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems. AI can process large amounts of data quickly, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. While AI enhances efficiency and innovation, it also raises ethical concerns like privacy, bias, and job displacement. As AI continues to evolve, responsible development and regulation are crucial for its benefits.",

It\u2019s a new beginning.\n\nIt can handle repetitive tasks and leave room for creative, strategic work.\n\n\u2192 Embrace new skills.\n\nLearning AI tools and techniques can open doors to exciting roles like AI trainers, AI ethicists, and more.\n\n\u2192 Collaborate, don't compete.\n\nAI can amplify human potential when we work alongside it.\n\nThis collaboration leads to innovation and opportunity.\n\n\u2192 See the bigger picture.\n\nAI isn\u2019t just about automation. It\u2019s about creating efficiencies that allow us to do more with less.\n\nIt can drive growth in sectors like banking, healthcare, and beyond.\n\nThe key?\n\nEmpower AI to empower us.\n\nStart today.\n\nLearn, adapt, and leverage AI as a tool to create new opportunities.\n\nLet's transform fear into fuel for growth.\n\nWhat roles do you see AI creating in your field?",

Just like ATMs didn\u2019t replace bankers (but made their work easier) and spreadsheets didn\u2019t eliminate accountants (but saved them from manual calculations), AI is here to enhance our capabilities, not erase them.\n\nFor example in Fintech and beyond, AI is already:\n\u2705 Detecting fraud faster than ever\n\u2705 Automating repetitive tasks\n\u2705 Personalizing financial services\n\u2705 Helping businesses scale efficiently\n\nBut does that mean humans are out of the picture? Nope. The problems we solve today are more complex than ever. AI won\u2019t take your job, but someone who knows how to use AI might.\n\nSo, instead of fearing AI, embrace it, learn it, and leverage it. The future belongs to those who evolve with technology\u2014not those who resist it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, in a few years, every WhatsApp family group will have an uncle saying, \"Beta, AI se paisa kaise banate hain?\"",

Instead, it is exposing us to risks most businesses are not prepared for.\n\u2666 Deepfake scams are bankrupting companies with AI-generated voices of CEOs\n\u2666 AI-driven cyberattacks are 300% more effective than traditional phishing\n\u2666 Bias in AI is real and affecting real people. Women are being denied loans. Job applicants are being rejected because of their race. Patients are receiving the wrong diagnoses\n\nWe have handed AI the keys to our future, but most organisations have no control over how it makes decisions.\n\nHere is the reality. AI models do not think. They do not understand ethics. They do not care about fairness. If left unchecked, AI will amplify biases, increase security vulnerabilities, and create massive legal risks.\n\nThis is already happening. Amazon\u2019s AI-powered hiring tool discriminated against women. Tesla\u2019s AI was tricked by a few strategically placed stickers, leading to incorrect driving decisions. And deepfake scams are stealing millions from companies every day.\n\nThe problem is not AI. The problem is us.\n\u2666 Most businesses deploy AI without truly understanding it\n\u2666 Most leaders assume AI is neutral when it is absolutely not\n\u2666 Most organisations are blindly trusting AI systems that are flawed, biased, and hackable\n\nIt does not have to be this way.\n\nAI TRiSM, AI Trust, Risk, and Security Management, is the solution. But too many businesses are ignoring it, and the consequences will be catastrophic.\n\u2666 Explainability: If you cannot explain how AI made a decision, how can you trust it?\n\u2666 ModelOps: If AI is not monitored, it will drift and make costly mistakes\n\u2666 AI Security: Hackers are already manipulating AI models to bypass security\n\u2666 Privacy and Compliance: If your AI violates GDPR or CCPA, your company is at risk of multi-million dollar lawsuits\n\nThis is not an IT problem. This is a leadership problem. If AI is not actively secured, businesses, employees, and customers are at risk.\n\nAn article has been published breaking down AI TRiSM, including real-world case studies and practical steps for businesses to implement it.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Read it here:\n\n\ud83d\udcac I want to hear from you.\n\u2666 Do you fully trust AI systems in your organisation?\n\u2666 What is your biggest concern about AI governance and security?\n\u2666 Have you experienced AI bias or security issues firsthand?\n\nComment below.

        "text": "**Scale AI Under Federal Investigation for Labor Compliance** \n\nScale AI, a leading AI data labeling firm, is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor for compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act. This federal law sets wage and hour requirements to protect workers.\n\nThe company, known for supplying high-quality data to train AI models, relies on a vast network of contract workers. The investigation will determine whether these workers are properly classified and compensated. Misclassification of contractors has been a growing concern in the tech industry, with companies facing legal challenges over worker rights and benefits.\n\nThis scrutiny raises important questions about the future of labor in AI-driven businesses. As more companies scale through contract-based work, ensuring fair wages and proper worker classification will remain a priority for regulators. Businesses must stay ahead of compliance risks to avoid legal and reputational damage.\n\nFor industry leaders and AI-focused companies, this case serves as a reminder to evaluate labor practices and ensure compliance with U.S. labor laws. With AI\u2019s rapid growth, the balance between innovation and fair labor practices will be critical for long-term success.",

A clear plan ensures data, security, and tech are ready to scale, accelerating innovation and maintaining a lasting advantage.\n\nAI leadership most often comes from the top.

Only 21% have fully adapted their workflows to leverage AI, despite seeing better results.\n\nReal change involves more than automating tasks; it's about redefining job roles and business processes.

The payroll team's cron job held together by 15 year old legacy code? AI agent. Anything your kids or junior developers spin up using Cursor? Practically sentient.\n\nLike all innovation, there are buzzwords, hype, early adopters, and also a bunch of haters. I'm not a hater, and I've enjoyed building with LLMs over the past five years. Being in cyber security, it's been a no-brainer to completely change my workflow.\n\nI believe knowledge work will change sooner than we think, and it's not a chat interface that's going to do it. True AI agents are a different beast - they observe, decide, and act autonomously on our behalf. The lag between the rapid pace of innovation on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn is still pretty wide, and I can only imagine how far behind the Boards of major organisations are. Let alone how far ahead the real ML researchers are.\n\nWhen your agent has permission to:\n- Access sensitive systems\n- Make financial decisions\n- Communicate as you\n- Execute changes without supervision\n...you've essentially handed admin keys to a digital worker with no security training.\n\nCommon risks around ChatGPT and Claude, such as leaking personal information and IP in droves, continue today. And an even bigger risk - prompt injection - is still unsolved (s/o).\n\nWe really need to knuckle down to secure truly agentic AI.\n\nAnd that's what I set out to do, while taking you on my journey (welcome).\n\nI've been building and breaking AI systems to understand their security boundaries over the years. I'll be sharing what I learn about securing agents before they too are \"risk accepted\".\n\nWhat's your take, and what would you like to learn? Should we start with the basics, what is a real AI agent after all? Let's give MCP a crack?",

AI is a tool, not a replacement.\nI use AI almost daily, not just for efficiency, but to stay ahead, learn, and truly understand its potential. It helps streamline processes, analyze data, and optimize decision-making. But one thing remains unchanged: Great HR is built on human connection.\n\nWhere AI Falls Short:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Building trust & emotional connections. No algorithm can replace the power of genuine human relationships.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Navigating complex human dynamics. People aren\u2019t just data points. Understanding emotions, motivations, and team chemistry requires intuition.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Interpreting context beyond the numbers. AI provides insights, but only humans can make sense of nuances, ethics, and cultural subtleties.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Creating a workplace where people feel seen & valued. A thriving company isn\u2019t built on automation; it\u2019s built on belonging.\n\nThe key here is balance. The leaders who will shape the future of work aren\u2019t the ones who fear AI, or blindly rely on it. They\u2019re the ones who integrate AI while keeping empathy, ethics, and human connection at the core.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Your turn: Do you see AI in HR as a game-changer or a risk? Let\u2019s discuss in the comments!\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Share to inspire your network.\n\ud83d\udd14 Follow to see more of my insights:",

It saves time by automating repetitive tasks, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be sitting idle. Companies will use that extra time to take on more projects, explore new opportunities, and improve quality. So, instead of having less work, you\u2019ll have new, exciting, and more valuable work to do!\n\n- AI won\u2019t replace you\u2014BUT someone who knows AI will! The real risk isn\u2019t AI; it\u2019s ignoring AI. If you don\u2019t upgrade your skills, someone else who does will take your place.\n\nBottom line? Learn AI, use AI, and stay ahead!

This shift demands we reimagine not just technology's role in society, but our entire conception of work, value creation, and economic organization.",

Why Aren\u2019t More Companies Taking AI Seriously?\n\nAnother week brings another round of headlines about major companies cutting jobs and replacing them with AI. This is no longer a futuristic prediction. It is happening now.\n\nWhat surprises me most is not the layoffs, but the lack of urgency from many companies when it comes to AI adoption. Despite all the discussions around AI, it is still a small percentage of conversations in business meetings. Companies acknowledge its impact, but very few are integrating it into their core strategy.\n\nI believe AI is the ultimate equalizer. Small companies that leverage AI will scale faster and outperform incumbents. Individuals who know how to use AI effectively will be significantly more productive, efficient, and capable than their peers. Those who ignore AI risk falling behind.\n\nWe are entering a new era where efficiency and automation will reach levels beyond what we ever imagined. The companies and individuals that thrive will be those who think AI-first, not as an afterthought but as a core driver of their strategy.\n\nIf you are in procurement and want to see how ProcureFlow can help you, reach out to me.

This paradox highlights a deeper issue that is not discussed enough\u2014the rapid evolution of technology is making certain skill sets obsolete faster than ever. As a result, companies find their existing talent portfolios outdated, forcing them to restructure while simultaneously hiring for next-generation technologies.\n\nMost tech companies that have downsized in recent cycles have made it clear they will continue hiring in cutting-edge domains. This signals a fundamental shift in workforce management, where continuous learning and adaptability have become more critical than ever.\n\nAs technology evolves rapidly, staying relevant requires continuous learning and adaptability. Companies that invest in upskilling and internal mobility are better equipped to navigate industry disruptions. Rather than relying solely on external hiring, investing in existing talent ensures a future-ready workforce by focusing on reskilling employees, identifying transferable skills, and fostering a culture of lifelong learning.",

A similar trend occurred with the banking system, where reliance on credit became unavoidable for modern life.\n\nWhile AI has the potential to enhance learning and development, realistically, its primary use will likely serve corporate and governmental interests in ways that may not benefit society as a whole.\n\nAI will be used to replace human workers, leading to mass layoffs.\n\nAI will be misused in warfare and oppression, as seen in past instances where Apple, Google, and Amazon have been engaged in human rights violations.\n\nAI will contribute to mass manipulation through propaganda and misinformation.\n\nAI could further diminish critical thinking skills, exacerbating the effects of mass media influence.\n\nGiven these risks, it is crucial to develop strategies that prevent unchecked corporate control over AI and other emerging technologies. There should be limits on business expansion to prevent monopolistic power from concentrating in the hands of a few. The current system, dominated by profit-driven decision-makers, needs structural reform to ensure that technology serves humanity rather than exploits it.\n\nThat being said, is it possible to take a more measured approach to this technology?

        "text": "Lately, I keep asking myself: Why do so many companies think about AI in such an uninspired, boring and even harmful way? Instead of imagining new possibilities, some CEOs seem obsessed with one idea: \"Can I just replace my team with AI?\"\n\nThe National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) thought they could. They replaced their human-staffed helpline with \"Tessa,\" an AI chatbot. What happened? The bot started offering harmful advice \u2013 telling people with eating disorders to count calories and lose weight. The public outrage was massive. Rightfully so. NEDA had to take the chatbot down. But the real kicker? This decision came right after their human helpline staff voted to unionize.\n\nI wonder: How did anyone think this was a good idea?\n\nBecause at the end of the day, those who use your services often don\u2019t care whether you use AI or not. They care about feeling heard, respected, and understood.\n\nSo, should companies just hold off on AI-driven layoffs until the bots are better? Not what I mean. My take on this is not that AI is not yet there, but that we should finally find the actual power and possibilities of AI in our real world. AI is so much more than just a cost-cutting tool, it enables things that were not possible before \u2013 decision-making backed up by massive amount of data, real-time use of data, automation of massive processes for single users, providing useable interfaces for non-experts onto complex knowledge or systems...\n\nOkay, back to the original topic (layoffs because of AI takeover) and the here and now.\nTake IKEA. They introduced \"Billie,\" an AI chatbot handling almost half of their customer inquiries. But instead of firing their 8,500 call center employees, they reskilled them \u2013 building up a powerful team of interior design advisors. The result? Better customer service and a $1.4 billion revenue boost.\n\nThe real innovators aren\u2019t asking, \"Can I replace my team?\" They\u2019re asking:\n\n\ud83d\udca1 How can AI help us serve customers better?\n\ud83d\udca1 How can AI free up people for more meaningful work?\n\ud83d\udca1 How can AI help us create something new?\n\nI do hope we will find the good use for AI, maybe even the use that goes way beyond customer satisfaction, but actually helps us with the next few challenges around sustainability and other crisis we have to deal with. The problems are there, so are a lot of the solutions... well, until then, I am happy to find new examples of positive, helpful new implementations of AI\u2019s power.

As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.\n\nIf the US faces a recession in 2025, it will \"Turbocharge\" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapore\u2019s economic growth to be between 1% and 3%\u2014a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.\n\nAt the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.\n\nLooking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globally\u2014but we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.\n\nThe key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?\n\nWhat do you think?",

But now, AI-driven automation is shaking its very foundations. Once called the \"outsourcing hub of the world,\" Bengaluru is witnessing mass layoffs and hiring slowdowns as AI replaces low-skill IT jobs at an unprecedented rate. IT giants like,, andhave already slashed over 60,000 jobs, with hiring hitting its lowest in more than a decade. The rise of AI-powered automation is forcing companies to rethink their workforce needs, and Bengaluru\u2019s famed migration boom may soon start to dwindle.\n\n\u201cThe way things are moving, there\u2019s a high chance of mass job losses in Bengaluru in the coming weeks to months,\u201d a Reddit user predicted, reflecting the growing fears of IT professionals. While automation is disrupting service-based roles in software development, testing, and support, industry leaders insist that adaptation is key. \u201cYes, some low-level coding roles might get automated, but at the same time, we\u2019re seeing a surge in demand for AI engineering, machine learning, and cloud expertise,\u201d said, VP of TeamLease Digital. Bengaluru has survived tech revolutions before\u2014from outsourcing to cloud computing\u2014and many believe it can weather this storm, too.\n\nBut the effects of AI go beyond just tech jobs. Bengaluru\u2019s economy thrives on the massive spending power of IT professionals\u2014from high rents in Outer Ring Road to the bustling chai stalls and rooftop bars in Indiranagar. If hiring stagnates and layoffs continue, small businesses, landlords, and the city\u2019s infrastructure could feel the ripple effects. Even traffic congestion might improve\u2014not as a result of better urban planning, but simply because fewer people will be commuting to work. With AI transforming industries at a pace never seen before, Bengaluru stands at a critical juncture.\n\nRead the complete article to know more-",

Contrary to popular fears of mass job losses, the findings highlight a more nuanced reality:\n\n- AI is transforming jobs, not just replacing them. Many professions will see increased efficiency and demand, rather than outright displacement.\n- Tech roles are growing: Software developers (+17.9%) and data specialists benefit from automation rather than being replaced by it. A surprise for many!\n- Routine jobs are declining: AI is taking over repetitive administrative tasks, leading to a reduction in support roles.\n- Expertise still matters: Financial advisors, engineers, and regulated professions remain in demand \u2013 where human judgment is critical, AI enhances rather than replaces.\n- AI adoption is slower than expected: Regulatory barriers, integration complexity, and societal acceptance slow down the impact\n\nKey takeaway from this report: AI is a powerful tool, but not an instant disruptor. The real transformation happens where technology meets human expertise.\n\nBased on my personal experience running some AI projects:\nShort term gains are inflated, especially by software sales trying to sell products and expertise. \"Turn-key-solutions\" are the most impactful tools right now with high probability of successful implementation and fast break-evens (for example in cyber-security). Customized projects scale very slow and external expertise for successful implementation is hard to find - if any.\n\nSo bottom-line: the short term impact is overrated, the long term transformation still underrated - at least based on my personal experience and this data..\n\nAgree?",

Series A software companies have reduced their teams from an average of 22 employees in 2022 to just 15 in 2024...and as the Carta data shows, across most early stages in venture, team sizes have declined pretty strongly since 2022.\n\nWhile economic factors like the funding crunch & increased focus on capital efficiency certainly explain part of this trend, the AI factor cannot be ignored. When founders explicitly state they're delaying hires because their current team + AI tools can handle more work than expected, we're seeing a real-time demonstration of how AI will impact employment patterns.\n\nThis aligns with what economists call \"technological unemployment\" - but with an important nuance. In previous technological revolutions, automation typically displaced lower-skilled jobs first. AI's impact appears to be affecting knowledge workers at the outset, changing the sequence we've historically observed.\n\nThere's also evidence that AI tools are creating new categories of jobs and enhancing productivity in ways that could ultimately expand employment in different areas. The \"AI productivity paradox\" might be that while individual companies need fewer employees, the broader ecosystem could generate more total jobs through new ventures, enhanced capabilities, and novel business models.\n\nWhat's your perspective? Are you seeing AI primarily as a job displacement force or as a productivity multiplier that might ultimately create more opportunity?",

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining a review of existing literature (primarily ISI-indexed journal articles) with a qualitative analysis of industry reports and expert interviews.  Key findings indicate that while AI-driven automation will lead to displacement in certain job categories, particularly those involving routine tasks, it will also simultaneously create new job roles in areas such as AI development, maintenance, and data analysis.  The net effect on employment is complex and dynamic, varying across different sectors and skill levels. The study concludes that proactive measures, including investment in education and reskilling initiatives, are crucial to mitigate the negative impacts of AI and harness its potential for economic growth and improved quality of life.\n\n\nKeywords: artificial intelligence, job displacement, job creation, automation, future of work\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various aspects of society, with one of the most significant impacts being on the labor market. The increasing capabilities of AI systems, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, are enabling automation of tasks previously performed by humans. This raises concerns about widespread job displacement and the potential for increased unemployment.\nHistorically, technological advancements have often led to shifts in the job market, with some jobs becoming obsolete while new ones emerge. The current wave of AI-driven automation is arguably different in its scale and scope, potentially affecting a wider range of occupations than previous technological revolutions.\nThere's a significant debate about the net effect of AI on employment. Some argue that AI will lead to mass unemployment, while others predict that it will create more jobs than it destroys. This uncertainty constitutes a critical research gap, requiring a nuanced understanding of both the displacement and creation effects of AI.\nThe purpose of this research is to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of AI on job displacement and creation, clarifying the complex dynamics at play. The research question is: How does the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence impact levels of employment overall, as well as the creation of new job opportunities?\nThe primary hypothesis is while AI will lead to significant job displacement in specific sectors and roles, particularly those involving repetitive and routine tasks, it will also concurrently generate new job opportunities, necessitating adaptation and reskilling",

        "text": "It\u2019s the post no one wanted to write.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve had meetings with great, talented, experienced people who aren\u2019t getting calls back for jobs. We\u2019ve had clients cancel meetings due to layoffs. Last week, at a conference of CEOs, hiring came up. Those in construction, skilled trades, nursing, security, and blue-collar fields said they still can\u2019t find enough talent. But white-collar employers? They were grim\u2014either planning layoffs or staying flat.\nWhy?\n\u2705 AI? Absolutely.\n\u2705 A crashing stock market? That too.\n\u2705 Tariffs? Yes.\n\u2705 Just general uncertainty? Without a doubt.\n\nSo what\u2019s my advice for job seekers?\n1. Network\nEnd every networking meeting with \u201cWho else should I be talking to?\u201d Most of our hires come from warm referrals. No one enjoys screening through hundreds of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. And competing with hundreds of candidates based on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 alone? Even worse.\n2. Learn AI\nWhether you\u2019re in sales, engineering, HR, or marketing, AI is reshaping your industry. Even being out of the workforce for six months can put you behind.\nYesterday, someone here sent around a list of a few hundred sales prospects. Six months ago, our office manager would have spent hours categorizing companies, researching contacts, and tracking down emails. Now? We fine-tuned an AI prompt, and it did the work in seconds. Then, a human spent 30 minutes refining.\n\nBonus tip: If you\u2019re currently employed in an office and not using AI, now is the time to learn. In 12 months, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an office job that won\u2019t require AI as a core tool.\n\n3. Get Tactical.\nAmong my peers, we\u2019re hiring tactical, hands-on, billable, revenue-generating, high-productivity team members. That might mean stepping away from VP or C-level strategy and getting your hands dirty again. In uncertain times, the jobs go to people who can drive revenue or deliver on the product or service.\n\n4. Get Creative.\nThis week, someone outside my network sent me an email so compelling that I had to meet with him. We grabbed coffee. While he waited for me to wrap up my previous meeting, he sat down and read a book on AI prompts.\nI asked how he found me. He explained:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f He hired an overseas VA to identify companies NOT recruiting heavily on LinkedIn or Indeed.\n\u27a1\ufe0f He used AI to generate research and contacts.\n\u27a1\ufe0f He used AI to craft messaging specific to each company and contact.\n\u27a1\ufe0f He offered to sign an NDA and do free brainstorming sessions before discussing a contract. If that went well, then he\u2019d explore full-time employment.\n\nI get hundreds of unsolicited emails and LinkedIn messages from job seekers. This was the only recent one I took. And I followed up immediately to meet again.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a tough few months. But companies still need people to deliver and grow. The market is cyclical, and it will rebound\u2014but it won\u2019t look the same.\n\nAdapting now isn\u2019t just about landing the next job. It\u2019s about preparing for the future of work.",

        "text": "Will AI Agents Reshape SaaS? A Look at the Buzz\nSaaS\u2014might face a shakeup from AI agents, according to a bold idea floating around tech circles lately.\n\nThe theory lays out a three-step shift, and it\u2019s got IT pros talking.\n-- First, hiring slows. Companies lean on AI to boost efficiency, trimming the need for human operators.\n-- Next, AI agents plug straight into SaaS tools via APIs, skipping dashboards and human interfaces entirely.\n--Finally, within 2-3 years, AI takes over, running tasks solo, leaving SaaS as a quaint relic. It\u2019s a striking vision: humans clicking software could feel as outdated as saddling up a horse.\n\nWhat\u2019s Fueling the Hype\nSome see this as the future taking shape.\nPicture AI crafting tools on the fly\u2014software that\u2019s built, used, and discarded for each job, no static platforms required.\n\nOthers argue AI agents could become the primary users, shifting SaaS from serving people to feeding machine-driven workflows.\n\nThe appeal is clear: tailored solutions, faster outputs, less bloat.\n\nThe Pushback Holds Weight\nNot so fast, say the skeptics\u2014and they\u2019ve got a point.\n\nSaaS isn\u2019t just interfaces; it\u2019s robust infrastructure\u2014think APIs and scalable systems. Companies like Shopify prove it, thriving with API-driven setups that AI could enhance, not erase.\n\nBig players like Salesforce bank on enterprise loyalty and workflows tied to human oversight\u2014tough to uproot in a couple years.\n\nOne view even pegs SaaS as the steady foundation AI builds on, not replaces.\n\nThe Middle Path: Winners and Losers\nThis isn\u2019t a clean sweep either way.\n\nAPI-first firms like Stripe could ride this wave smoothly, meshing with AI like clockwork.\n\nBut those UI-heavy tools\u2014CRMs with more menus than a diner? They might struggle to keep up.\n\nIt\u2019s like travel agents after online booking hit: some adapted, others faded. SaaS could follow suit, with lean players gaining ground.\n\nWhat the Data Suggests\nReports from late 2024\u2014like one from HFS Research\u2014nod to AI pushing toward flexible, orchestrated systems, echoing Salesforce\u2019s cloud rise in the 2000s.\n\nTechCrunch countered later that year, pointing out SaaS subscriptions and upsells are too sticky to unravel fast.\n\nGartner\u2019s $208 billion SaaS market estimate for 2024, up 18% annually, backs the staying power.\nNo hard numbers lock this down\u2014it\u2019s still a forecast, not a fact sheet.\n\nWhere This Lands\nThis debate pits bold predictions against practical realities\u2014a tech classic.\n\nThe 2-3 year timeline sparks excitement among forward-thinkers picturing autonomous, API-fed workflows.\n\nBut momentum, human control, and SaaS\u2019s proven scale suggest a slower shift\u2014evolution, not extinction.\n\nAPI champs will likely pull ahead, clunky platforms will scramble, and IT pros get a front-row seat to the action.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s a solid bet SaaS adapts and thrives alongside AI, not under it.",

        "text": "Will AI replace tech jobs in the next decade?\n\nPredicting whether AI will fully \"replace\" tech jobs in the next decade is tricky\u2014it's more of a transformation than a straight swap. AI\u2019s already reshaping the tech landscape, automating repetitive tasks like code testing, debugging, and even basic software design. Tools like GitHub Copilot or no-code platforms are speeding up development, meaning fewer humans are needed for grunt work. A 2023 Goldman Sachs report estimated that AI could automate up to 25% of jobs in the tech sector, especially in areas like IT support, data entry, and routine programming. That\u2019s not trivial.\n\nBut here\u2019s the flip side: AI doesn\u2019t just kill jobs\u2014it creates them too. Demand\u2019s spiking for roles like AI trainers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists to build and manage\nthese systems. The World Economic Forum\u2019s 2023 Future of Jobs report pegged\n\nAI-related roles as the fastest-growing segment in tech, with a projected net gain of jobs through 2030. Tech isn\u2019t shrinking; it\u2019s shifting. Think of it like the industrial revolution\u2014machines took over manual labor, but new skills became king.\n\nThe real kicker is adaptability. If you\u2019re a coder stuck on legacy systems or basic scripting, AI might eat your lunch. But if you\u2019re leveling up\u2014say, mastering AI integration,\ncybersecurity, or complex system architecture\u2014you\u2019re probably fine. Companies still need humans for creativity, strategy, and the messy stuff AI can\u2019t handle yet, like ethical calls or client hand-holding.\n\nSo, next decade? AI won\u2019t \"replace\" tech jobs wholesale\u2014it\u2019ll redefine them. Some roles will fade, others will boom. Stay sharp, and you\u2019ll ride the wave instead of drowning in it.",

        "text": "Figure that listings tend to be about six months shifted from needs, it becomes pretty obvious that what you're looking at is the effects of the pandemic. Remember that there was a MASSIVE drop in employment in 2020 as companies furloughed then laid of millions of workers in the course of about four months, then just as rapid a need for rehiring as those same companies realized they needed to build out their remote workforce they'd just let go, pushing salaries sky high as a consequence. That peaked in late 2021 as it looked like we were coming out of the pandemic and companies were bulging at the seams with workers that were no longer required, so we went through a painful process of layoffs and ads dried up.\n\nSignificantly, the whole AI period shows barely a blip in comparison, which is truly odd given the hype surrounding it. Very few companies were actually hiring (something that I - and I suspect a lot of other people can attest to), which is exceptional when you realize that this was new technology that is/was supposed to transform the way that we did business. Indeed, the level of job postings is almost where it was at the bottom of the Trump recession and well below where it was before the pandemic.\n\nWhy? I honestly do not believe it really has all that much to do with genAI. Rather, I think we're seeing the effects of moving to everything to the cloud. The pandemic accelerated that process dramatically, in effect bringing demand forward by about a decade. However, what that has also done is create a trough in demand for IT services - people have what they need, and it's hard to argue with customers that they need yet another data service.\n\nInvestors set their expectectations based upon the returns from the pandemic, but that was also very anomalous. Personally, I think that GenAI is going to take a while to really mature, probably well into the 2030s, and more than likely IT is going to underperform the general market for the next few years or so.\n\nThere are two other factors. The first is that there was a practice among larger companies in particular during the pandemic of warehousing talent, in part to keep them out of competitors' hands when labour was tight. As the pandemic waned, many of them were let go, and companies went into a mode where they shifted away from having full time workers to hiring contractors and consultants. You're seeing a shift now in the kind of work being done, with shorter projects (the typical 18 month project is now doable in 3-4 months, as an example) and more extended periods between them. Some of this is AI, but more of it is simply that you're tying together services rather than having to build out complex components.\n\nThe second factor is that software is no longer a differentiator for most companies. AI Inside never really gained all that much traction; indeed, people have become bored (and turned off) by it as a marketing device, something that was inevitable.",

The conversations were eye-opening, especially about workplace AI adoption.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Reality check: Some people shared they're limited in using AI tools at work due to security concerns. While I get it, here's my take:\n\nYou need to own your AI journey. With Meta's recent layoffs hitting the news, it's crystal clear - waiting for your company to upskill you might mean getting that dreaded 5am \"you're redundant\" email.\n\nThink of AI skills like fitness - you wouldn't expect your company to exercise for you, right? It needs that same 3-times-a-week dedication. Your future self will thank you!\n\nThanks againandfor organising this massive event!

HR deals with probably the most sensitive information. It will take time for the entire HR community to build trust in training AI models on this information.\n\nThe flip side of people being the competitive advantage is very real.\n\n2. HR teams are getting leaner but the expectations from them are either same or have actually increased.\n\nWait doesn\u2019t that mean adoption should be faster because agentic AI can truly automate the operational part?\n\nTheoretically yes. But AI is not adopted in a silo. It means onboarding a new platform, a new technology, training people on it, and so on. This is where HR teams are facing a huge crunch.\n\n3. HR is at the forefront of communicating all people decisions. This unfortunately also means that layoffs and firing are very much a part of the JD.\n\nThe entire thing about AI replacing humans is not always a welcome proposition (no matter how true that is in the days to come).\n\nWhat does this mean for HR tech products?\n\n1. The focus should be on helping HR teams adopt AI within the org. Adoption, adoption, adoption.\n\n2. Real outcomes will sell better than superficial use cases of AI. It\u2019s great if AI can moderate the tone of a JD. Is it truly game changing? Not really.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m very excited about these developments. It means there is a true focus on understanding how AI can make a genuine impact on the business and people, before jumping head first into it.",

Let\u2019s discuss:\n\nSalesforce just announced job cuts impacting over 1,000 employees, while simultaneously ramping up hiring for AI-focused sales roles.\n\nThis is the latest example of a trend we\u2019ve been seeing across Big Tech: companies aggressively investing in AI while optimizing for profitability.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\nLayoffs despite growth \u2192 Even with new AI products driving demand, Salesforce is tightening up operations to improve margins after facing pressure from activist investors.\n\nSales hires are still booming \u2192 The company is betting big on AI-powered sales tools and needs more talent to push them into the market.\n\nEfficiency is the new priority \u2192 Like,, and, Salesforce is proving that even industry leaders aren\u2019t immune to restructuring in the AI era.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\u2192 Workforce reductions are no longer just about downturns, they're part of a broader shift toward leaner, AI-optimized organizations.\n\n\u2192 The fact that Salesforce is hiring while cutting suggests that AI isn\u2019t always replacing jobs, it\u2019s reshaping them.\n\n\u2192 Public companies, especially in tech, are under immense scrutiny to balance AI investments with strong financial performance.\n\nMy take:\nSalesforce\u2019s strategy reflects a broader industry shift: AI-driven growth must be balanced with operational efficiency. Just because a company is launching hit AI products doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll ignore cost-cutting.\n\nThe big question: Is this just the start of AI-driven restructuring across the workforce?\n\nWould love to hear your thinking.

It can design. It can create and format documents. It can send e-mails. It can talk to people. It can optimize workflows. It can do taxes. It can produce 'adult content'. It can make music. It can create games. It can try to convince you that it has a soul.\n\nIt can do almost anything you can do better. It just needs the right inputs.\n\nWe're already seeing the impact.\n\nJeff Bezos was the first person who was worth $100b in 2018.\n\nNow at least 16 people hit that mark.\n\nOxfam believes at least 6 people will be worth over $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, jobs will be made redundant, wages will stagnate, inflation will continue.\n\nThe cost of goods will remain consistent while the cost of production will be a race to zero.\n\nWhite collar jobs are about to go away en masse. Blue color jobs are next as innovation in hardware and robotics accelerates with AI problem solvers.\n\nSo what the heck do we do?\n\nFive things I think about/do when I start feeling down about all of this:\n\n- Keep tech oligarchs from buying and controlling governments and regulations.\n\n- Keep unions strong so sensible worker protections can be maintained.\n\n- Learn the heck out of AI now to stave off unemployment as long as possible.\n\n- Push for Universal Basic Income. It's not a perfect system, but we must find ways to protect citizens who cannot find worthwhile employment.\n\n- Call your representatives and tell them to regulate AI NOW. If the models train, the company pays. If AI causes layoffs, corporations must assist society in providing soft landings. And the government must renew focus on innovation, free access to retraining/adult education, and anti-trust/anti-monopoly laws.\n\nWe can do this people!\n\nWe can face hard challenges, but you can't face something while looking the other way!",

Many employees brought back to physical offices are unknowingly participating in their own replacement - training the AI systems that will eventually automate significant portions of their roles.\n\nThe future won't be 9-5 office jobs, but human-in-the-loop validation roles with compensation tied directly to outcomes. The gig economy is coming for knowledge workers next.\n\nQuestion is: Why commute to train your digital replacement when you could be pivoting to become the human validator who ensures AI quality - and getting paid for outcomes rather than attendance?",

But there\u2019s a question no one\u2019s answering: Why would a company pay $20,000/month for an AI agent when the same model can be used for $20/month?\n\nThe $20 model still has serious flaws and requires intense human input. To make the $20K payment make sense, either the AI agent is using a different model altogether or someone at OpenAI would have to be working behind the scenes to fix its mistakes.\n\nIf it\u2019s the former, then why isn\u2019t OpenAI making those improvements available to all users? If it\u2019s the latter, then companies aren\u2019t paying for AI\u2014they\u2019re paying for hidden human labor.\n\nEither way, OpenAI hasn\u2019t explained why this product is worth the cost of a car every month\u2014especially when companies can hire overseas workers for far less.\n\nSo what\u2019s really going on?\n\nIt looks like AI agents aren\u2019t replacing workers\u2014they\u2019re justifying mass layoffs.\n\nIn the U.S., large-scale layoffs require companies to notify the state under the WARN Act. But if a company claims, \u201cWe\u2019re replacing 1,000 workers with 10 AI agents,\u201d regulators are likely to accept that explanation without question. The catch? No one checks if the company fires those AI agents a month later.\n\nThis creates a legal loophole for downsizing\u2014a convenient excuse to fire workers without scrutiny. And once the dust settles? Companies can quietly outsource those jobs overseas at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe real question isn\u2019t whether AI can replace workers\u2014it\u2019s whether AI is just being used as an excuse to fire them.",

AI agents can replace the applications and users both. For example, a manager doesn't need a DA, who uses say Excel, to get a report. Instead, the manager can simply ask the AI agent for the report. No need for the DA and Excel!\n\nThe manager can be replaced with an AI Agent who can create, compile, summaries all the reports and send them to the senior manager. This will remove a lot of middle layers between higher management and workers who can't to be replaced by AI Agents.

But the reality is far more exciting and full of opportunity.\n\nAs Human + Machine puts it:\n\n\u201cThe simple truth is that machines are not taking over the world, nor are they obviating the need for humans in the workplace. In this current era of business process transformation, AI systems are not replacing us wholesale; rather, they are amplifying our skills and collaborating with us to achieve productivity gains that have previously been impossible.\u201d\n\nRather than replacing jobs, AI is changing them. The real power of AI lies in complementing and augmenting human capabilities.\n\n\u201cBut what we\u2019ve found in our research is that although AI can be deployed to automate certain tasks, the technology\u2019s greater power is in complementing and augmenting human capabilities.\u201d\n\nAtwe see this transformation firsthand. AI is helping our global teams work smarter, not harder\u2014automating repetitive tasks, unlocking new efficiencies, and allowing our staff to focus on higher-value work that requires human intelligence, creativity, and emotional connection.\n\n\u201cthose companies that are using machines with a narrow view to replace humans will eventually stall, whereas those that think of innovative ways for machines to augment humans will become the leaders of their industries.\u201d\n\nThe future isn\u2019t AI vs. humans\u2014it\u2019s AI + humans.

It has made our daily tasks efficient and contributed positively towards important sectors.\n\nBut at the same time, it is also raising concerns regarding privacy, job displacement and ethical dilemma. I believe that by adopting a human-centric approach where every human being and individual believes that there is and that Nothing can replace human touch and human feel which firms the cornerstone of creating connections while forming deeper and meaningful relationships\n\nHere's my take on this. I think the AI is here to assist and not to replace. With judicious, responsible and ethical use of this tool, we can make it as a useful servant but not a dangerous master.\n\nThe main idea of AI has always been to help the mankind in their tasks. However, it is not the AI that is going to replace jobs but it is the human's greed that is going to make lose jobs.\n\nWhile some employers ask \"Why should I hire you when AI does the same job?\" On the contrary, why should a client choose your company while AI can still solve the same problem more efficiently that you do?\" As an interviewer, ask the right questions in your interviews.\n\nUpskilling is definitely considered a boon in any industry but AI shouldn't be a bane to humankind. The moment we start comparing a machine to a human, it is so weird to see such an employer who doesn't have the basic idea that a human brain and a brainless machine can never match.\n\nRemember, AI doesn't have feelings and emotions to remove jobs of humans it is the greed of humankind that's killing jobs.",

Today, no one mourns the loss of manual toll collection. Instead, we celebrate faster commutes, reduced traffic, and more efficient highway systems. The fear of job displacement due to automation is nothing new - but history shows us a different story.\n\nThe reality is that AI, like any transformative technology, doesn't simply eliminate jobs - it transforms them. Take our customer's AP department as an example. Rather than replacing their AP clerk, AI automation enabled that single employee to process an astounding $2B in annual spend. The clerk's role evolved from manual data entry to managing exceptions, analyzing patterns, and making strategic decisions.\n\nJust as E-ZPass didn't end transportation jobs but shifted them to more valuable areas, AI in finance isn't about replacement - it's about enhancement. It frees humans from mundane, repetitive tasks and allows them to focus on work that truly requires human judgment, creativity, and relationship building.\n\nThe next time someone says \"I'll never let AI touch our financials,\" remind them that their morning commute is smoother because they embraced automation at the toll booth. The future of finance isn't about fewer jobs - it's about better ones.",

Contrary to popular fears of mass job losses, the findings highlight a more nuanced reality:\n\n- AI is transforming jobs, not just replacing them. Many professions will see increased efficiency and demand, rather than outright displacement.\n- Tech roles are growing: Software developers (+17.9%) and data specialists benefit from automation rather than being replaced by it. A surprise for many!\n- Routine jobs are declining: AI is taking over repetitive administrative tasks, leading to a reduction in support roles.\n- Expertise still matters: Financial advisors, engineers, and regulated professions remain in demand \u2013 where human judgment is critical, AI enhances rather than replaces.\n- AI adoption is slower than expected: Regulatory barriers, integration complexity, and societal acceptance slow down the impact\n\nKey takeaway from this report: AI is a powerful tool, but not an instant disruptor. The real transformation happens where technology meets human expertise.\n\nBased on my personal experience running some AI projects:\nShort term gains are inflated, especially by software sales trying to sell products and expertise. \"Turn-key-solutions\" are the most impactful tools right now with high probability of successful implementation and fast break-evens (for example in cyber-security). Customized projects scale very slow and external expertise for successful implementation is hard to find - if any.\n\nSo bottom-line: the short term impact is overrated, the long term transformation still underrated - at least based on my personal experience and this data..\n\nAgree?",

At The Straits Times Education Forum 2025, leaders repeated the same tired script: \u201cWe need the best talent\u201d, \u201cEducation is key\u201d, \u201cSingapore must stay competitive\u201d. Meanwhile, AI is reshaping jobs faster than our policies can keep up.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Here\u2019s the real problem:\n\nAI is replacing jobs faster than we\u2019re reskilling workers. While other countries are pushing AI-driven upskilling, Singapore still prioritizes degrees over real-world skills. By the time graduates enter the workforce, their knowledge is already outdated.\n\nWe are obsessed with foreign talent while ignoring AI\u2019s impact on local jobs. Companies hire globally but are slow to retrain Singaporeans for AI-driven roles. What happens when AI automates white-collar jobs before we reskill our workforce?\n\nAI doesn\u2019t care about prestige degrees. It cares about adaptability. Yet, we still push a degree-first mentality while AI-driven industries value skills, experience, and innovation. Are we training workers for jobs that won\u2019t exist?\n\nWe are NOT building AI thought leadership. The West and China lead AI research, while Singapore remains a consumer. Where\u2019s the real investment in AI-powered education, R&D, and startups? Without this, we\u2019ll just be users, not leaders.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Here\u2019s what needs to happen NOW:\n\ud83d\udd39 Shift from degrees to AI-powered skills training - lifelong learning, not one-time education.\n\ud83d\udd39 Prioritize local workforce AI upskilling before foreign talent.\n\ud83d\udd39 Invest in AI-driven industries - Singapore must lead, not follow.\n\nAI will disrupt Singapore\u2019s workforce.

The list of \"Uncomfortable Truths\" for employers highlights what truly matters\u2014trust, leadership, fair pay, and a strong workplace culture. No AI system can replace the value of engaged, motivated, and happy employees.\n\nPeople don\u2019t quit jobs\u2014they quit bad managers. AI can streamline processes, but it cannot replace emotional intelligence, mentorship, or authentic leadership. Employees need clear communication, a culture of respect, and fair compensation\u2014not just automation to \"increase productivity.\" When companies undervalue these human elements, they risk losing their best talent to those who recognize their worth.\n\nToxic behavior, lack of trust, and poor leadership cannot be solved by AI-driven analytics alone. While technology can identify patterns, only human leaders can inspire, create belonging, and build trust. Happy employees are the foundation of happy customers\u2014because, as the image says, \"robots don\u2019t smile.\" Genuine connection, empathy, and teamwork will always be a company\u2019s greatest assets.\n\nSo, as organizations integrate AI into their operations, they must remember: technology should support people, not replace them.

Matching the colors of apparel and accessories to ensure accuracy.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always easy-sometimes, the product itself made it tricky, and my earnings fluctuated since I was paid per image. Some days were great, others not so much.\n\nBut today, AI is revolutionizing this entire process.\n\n- I recently tested a simple AI tool.\n- I uploaded my photo and an apparel image.\n- After a short wait, AI worked its magic-flawlessly matching colors in seconds!\n\nThe result? Perfect, effortless color accuracy.\n\nWe often hear complaints about AI replacing jobs. But instead of blaming AI tools, why not adopt them and work more efficiently?\n\nSo, how many of you are impressed by this technology? If you want to know the exact AI tool I used, like this post and comment \"Ai Gen\"-I will send you the details for FREE!\n\nLet\u2019s embrace the future and make our work smarter, not harder.",

        "text": "Is AI Really Taking Startup Jobs? Series A software companies have reduced their teams from an average of 22 employees in 2022 to just 15 in 2024...and as the Carta data shows, across most early stages in venture, team sizes have declined pretty strongly since 2022.\n\nWhile economic factors like the funding crunch & increased focus on capital efficiency certainly explain part of this trend, the AI factor cannot be ignored. When founders explicitly state they're delaying hires because their current team + AI tools can handle more work than expected, we're seeing a real-time demonstration of how AI will impact employment patterns.\n\nThis aligns with what economists call \"technological unemployment\" - but with an important nuance. In previous technological revolutions, automation typically displaced lower-skilled jobs first. AI's impact appears to be affecting knowledge workers at the outset, changing the sequence we've historically observed.\n\nThere's also evidence that AI tools are creating new categories of jobs and enhancing productivity in ways that could ultimately expand employment in different areas. The \"AI productivity paradox\" might be that while individual companies need fewer employees, the broader ecosystem could generate more total jobs through new ventures, enhanced capabilities, and novel business models.\n\nWhat's your perspective? Are you seeing AI primarily as a job displacement force or as a productivity multiplier that might ultimately create more opportunity?",

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining a review of existing literature (primarily ISI-indexed journal articles) with a qualitative analysis of industry reports and expert interviews.  Key findings indicate that while AI-driven automation will lead to displacement in certain job categories, particularly those involving routine tasks, it will also simultaneously create new job roles in areas such as AI development, maintenance, and data analysis.  The net effect on employment is complex and dynamic, varying across different sectors and skill levels. The study concludes that proactive measures, including investment in education and reskilling initiatives, are crucial to mitigate the negative impacts of AI and harness its potential for economic growth and improved quality of life.\n\n\nKeywords: artificial intelligence, job displacement, job creation, automation, future of work\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various aspects of society, with one of the most significant impacts being on the labor market. The increasing capabilities of AI systems, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, are enabling automation of tasks previously performed by humans. This raises concerns about widespread job displacement and the potential for increased unemployment.\nHistorically, technological advancements have often led to shifts in the job market, with some jobs becoming obsolete while new ones emerge. The current wave of AI-driven automation is arguably different in its scale and scope, potentially affecting a wider range of occupations than previous technological revolutions.\nThere's a significant debate about the net effect of AI on employment. Some argue that AI will lead to mass unemployment, while others predict that it will create more jobs than it destroys. This uncertainty constitutes a critical research gap, requiring a nuanced understanding of both the displacement and creation effects of AI.\nThe purpose of this research is to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of AI on job displacement and creation, clarifying the complex dynamics at play. The research question is: How does the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence impact levels of employment overall, as well as the creation of new job opportunities?\nThe primary hypothesis is while AI will lead to significant job displacement in specific sectors and roles, particularly those involving repetitive and routine tasks, it will also concurrently generate new job opportunities, necessitating adaptation and reskilling",

While some roles will evolve, AI is set to generate more jobs than it replaces.\n\nHere's the scoop:\n\n170 million new jobs by 2030: The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts that AI and related technologies will create 170 million new jobs worldwide by 2030, even as 92 million existing jobs become redundant.\n\n86% of businesses transformed: AI is expected to revolutionize 86% of businesses, leading to roles we can't even imagine today.\n\nDemand for AI skills soaring: In 2025, the need for AI expertise is set to skyrocket, with companies like Salesforce aiming to fill thousands of AI-related positions.\n\nIn Australia, automation and AI could save workers 245 hours annually\u2014that's over six weeks\u2014enhancing job satisfaction and work-life balance.\n\nSo, how can you ride this wave?\n\nInvest in Continuous Learning: Enroll in courses that enhance your understanding of AI and its applications.\n\nDevelop Complementary Skills: AI thrives on data, but human creativity and critical thinking remain irreplaceable. Cultivate skills that AI can't replicate, such as strategic planning and emotional intelligence.\n\nSeek Out AI Integration Opportunities: Look for ways AI can augment your current role. For instance, learning to operate AI-driven tools can streamline tasks and boost productivity.\n\nParticipate in Workshops and Seminars: Engage in events that focus on AI advancements and their impact on your industry. These platforms offer insights and networking opportunities with like-minded professionals.\n\nEmbracing AI isn't about replacing humans; it's about augmenting our capabilities, leading to more fulfilling and innovative careers. Let's focus on reskilling and upskilling to seize the opportunities this AI-driven era offers.",

No fluff\u2014just straight talk on what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not.\n\nSome big takeaways:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 The AI workforce gamble \u2013 Some businesses are already making bold claims about AI replacing jobs, but is that a smart bet? AI isn\u2019t a magic fix\u2014it often just shifts the problems somewhere else.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Hype vs. reality \u2013 AI has massive potential, but integrating it into existing systems is proving harder than many expected. The tools are advancing fast, but so are the challenges they create.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 AI\u2019s price tag \u2013 The cost of AI is still a major barrier. With some businesses struggling to justify the spend, could this push tech pricing towards outcome-based models rather than the usual subscriptions?\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Adoption is stalling \u2013 AI is everywhere, but full-scale adoption? Not so much. One reason: no one\u2019s training teams on how to actually use it. Maybe it\u2019s time for an AI Enablement Officer to help businesses get real value from AI instead of just experimenting with it.\n\nBig shoutout tofor hosting and to everyone who joined the discussion! Thanks again toandfor facilitating.\n\nWhat do you reckon\u2014are businesses truly getting ahead with AI, or just hoping for the best?",

However, the increasing prevalence of AI has sparked intense debate and controversy among experts and communities. This article explores the risks associated with AI and the ongoing discussions surrounding its use.\n\n### \\*\\*Risks Involved in the Use of Artificial Intelligence\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Loss of Jobs\\*\\*\nAI is replacing human jobs on a massive scale, raising concerns about unemployment and economic shifts. Many professionals are worried as AI quickly takes over roles across industries, with a significant number of companies planning to reduce their workforce by adopting this technology.\n\n2. \\*\\*Increases the Problem of Bias and Discrimination\\*\\*\nAI systems, which rely on data for operations, often generate biased results. This is particularly evident in areas like facial recognition and hiring processes, where flawed data can lead to discriminatory decisions, impacting fairness and equity in various sectors.\n\n3. \\*\\*Affects Privacy and Surveillance\\*\\*\nThe widespread use of AI has raised significant privacy concerns. AI technologies can collect vast amounts of data, leading to potential information leaks and misuse. Some countries also use AI for surveillance, threatening personal privacy and civil liberties.\n\n4. \\*\\*Lack of Regulation\\*\\*\nThe regulation of AI varies widely across countries. While some nations implement strict laws, others lack any formal framework to govern AI use. This inconsistency raises the risk of AI being exploited for unethical purposes.\n\n5. \\*\\*Use of AI in Warfare Techniques\\*\\*\nAI is increasingly being utilized in military technology, including the development of autonomous weapons. This trend reduces human control in warfare, posing significant risks of dangerous consequences and ethical dilemmas.\n\n### \\*\\*Conclusion\\*\\*\nWhile AI offers immense potential, its risks cannot be overlooked. Experts emphasize the need for ethical solutions and responsible management of AI to mitigate these challenges. The future of AI depends on addressing these concerns and ensuring its benefits are realized without harm to humanity.\n\nRead more about this crucial topic here:",

Some of you know me from my first jobs, some from a webinar or conference we both attended, and others purely through my online persona. We\u2019ve crossed paths in different spaces, at different times, for different reasons.\n\nBut if we haven\u2019t caught up in a while, I thought it might be a good idea to talk about what I do, in the simplest terms: I work on making the process of working easier. Yes, it\u2019s in the project management space, but the reality is that everything we discuss in project management applies to nearly every field.\n\nHere\u2019s what this looks like in practice:\n\n\ud83d\udca1 On Women\u2019s Day, I had the privilege of discussing the pay gap\u2014why it persists, how one can advocate for themselves, and what it takes to actually close the gap, not just acknowledge it.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 While people worry about AI replacing jobs, I focus on how AI can become a thought partner\u2014a tool that doesn\u2019t take over, but enhances human expertise. The real question isn\u2019t if AI will impact jobs, but how we can upskill to work alongside it and future-proof our careers.\n\n\ud83c\udfe2 As companies called employees back to offices, I explored a fundamental truth: where you work is far less important than how your team works. The most effective teams aren\u2019t bound by location, but by thoughtfully designed collaboration and workflows that empower them\u2014whether they\u2019re remote, hybrid, or in-office.\n\nAnd I get to do all of this with real data, not just opinions. I work with insights from some of the most innovative, impactful, and fascinating organizations in the world\u2014learning from them, sharing their stories, and shaping better ways of working.\n\nWhy Do I Do This?\nBecause for most people, work isn\u2019t just something we do\u2014it\u2019s something we worry about.\n\nI\u2019ve grown up seeing people stressed, overworked, undervalued, and stuck in rigid workplaces that don\u2019t serve them. I refuse to accept that as the norm.\n\nWork should be:\n\u2705 Flexible\u2014because life doesn\u2019t fit into a 9-to-5 box.\n\u2705 Meaningful\u2014because we spend too many hours working for it not to matter.\n\u2705 Sustainable\u2014because burnout shouldn\u2019t be the price of success.\n\nI believe we can rethink work\u2014not just for productivity, but for people. We can build workplaces that enhance not only work-life balance, but work-life fulfillment.\n\nThis \"re\"introduction was inspired byand his shared on LinkedIn last month.\n\nNow, I Want to Hear From You: We\u2019re all here for different reasons, with different stories. So, tell me: What do you do\u2014and, more importantly, why do you do it?\n\nDrop a comment below. Let\u2019s start a conversation. \ud83d\udc47",

And let me tell you what\u2019s happening is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in the past 20 years.\n\nWe\u2019re not just talking about automation anymore. AI is changing how we think, create, and connect with customers in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nHere are the numbers that stopped me in my tracks:\n\n\u2192AI chatbots will handle 85% of customer interactions that\u2019s a 4X increase from today.\n\n\u219230% of marketing tasks will be automated, freeing teams to focus on strategy and creativity.\n\n\u219297 million new AI-enabled jobs will emerge globally proving that AI isn\u2019t just replacing jobs, it\u2019s creating them.\n\nThe most exciting part isn\u2019t automation it\u2019s how AI is helping marketers make better decisions.\n\nPredicting customer behavior before they even know what they want\n\nExample:anddon\u2019t just suggest what you might like\u2014they anticipate your next move based on tiny behavioral cues. AI-driven marketing will soon do the same, predicting which product a customer will buy, when, and why.\n\nCreating hyper-personalized content at scale\n\nExample:has already experimented with AI-generated ad creatives tailored to individual consumers. Imagine campaigns that adjust in real time, responding to each person\u2019s preferences, location, and mood.\n\nUnderstanding customer emotions in real time\n\nExample: Brands likeandare leveraging emotion AI to tailor experiences based on a user\u2019s mood. Soon, AI will help brands respond to sentiment shifts, adjusting messaging before customers even voice concerns.\n\nThe companies that embrace AI today will have a head start over their competitors. But this isn\u2019t just about tech it\u2019s about how we use it to enhance creativity, storytelling, and human connection.\n\nMarketing has always been about understanding people. AI just gives us better tools to do that at scale.\n\nhow will you use AI to make marketing more human?",

This is one of the first large-scale efforts to measure AI\u2019s role across industries with empirical evidence rather than assumptions.\n\n\ud83d\udcd1 What the Data Tells Us\n\n\ud83d\udd39 AI is already embedded in the workforce - 36% of occupations now use AI for at least a quarter of their tasks. AI\u2019s biggest footprint? Software development and writing, which account for nearly half of all AI interactions.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 AI is more of a collaborator than a replacement. 57% of AI usage is augmentation\u2014helping professionals refine ideas, draft content, and analyze information. 43% involves automation, where AI completes tasks with minimal human involvement.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 AI is concentrated in mid-to-high-wage jobs. Software engineers, data scientists, and analysts are leading AI adoption. 4% of jobs already rely on AI for at least 75% of their work.\n\n\u2757 Why It Matters\n\n\ud83d\udd39 AI isn\u2019t taking over jobs\u2014it\u2019s changing how work gets done. Instead of replacing workers, AI is reshaping tasks, shifting job structures, and amplifying productivity.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Businesses must rethink workforce strategies. AI skills are now essential for career longevity, and companies that integrate AI effectively will gain an innovation and efficiency edge.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Regulation and governance need to keep up. With AI driving workplace transformation, clear policies, governance, and responsible adoption strategies will be critical for long-term success.\n\n\ud83d\udd11 Key Takeaway for Business Leaders\n\nAI isn\u2019t coming for your workforce\u2014it\u2019s coming for how work gets done.\nTo stay ahead, businesses must:\n\n\u2714 Invest in AI literacy\u2014Equip employees with the right skills to use AI effectively.\n\u2714 Identify high-impact AI use cases\u2014Focus on AI-driven augmentation rather than full automation.\n\u2714 Balance innovation with governance\u2014AI success depends on clear policies, ethical guidelines, and strategic integration.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 link to post in the comments \u2935\ufe0f",

Here, I have tried to express my thoughts from all the readings that I did.\n\nFor decades, India has dominated the IT and BPO sectors, thriving on cost arbitrage. The formula was simple: offshore repetitive, process-driven work to India at scale. But AI is rewriting that script.\n\nSo, will AI kill India\u2019s IT-BPO industry? No.\n\nBut will it restructure it? Absolutely.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f AI is wiping out low-end jobs.\nData entry? Automated. Customer support? AI chatbots. Coding at scale? AI copilots are already replacing junior developers. The BPO model we knew is dead.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f BPO 2.0 isn\u2019t about cost arbitrage; it\u2019s about execution arbitrage.\nThe game is shifting from manpower to AI-first operations. Businesses won\u2019t just outsource work - they\u2019ll outsource AI-driven execution. Companies that adapt will thrive. Others? Well\u2026\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f India\u2019s IT giants aren\u2019t sitting idle.\nTCS, Infosys, Wipro - they see the writing on the wall. They aren\u2019t waiting to be disrupted; they\u2019re embedding AI into their delivery models, shifting from bulk outsourcing to AI-driven transformation consulting.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f But here\u2019s my counterpoint:\nI don\u2019t buy into the \u201cIndia will upskill\u201d narrative. We don\u2019t upskill fast enough.\nFor every AI engineer India produces,\nitself is making 10 others redundant. And that\u2019s the problem no one wants to talk about.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f The hard truth:\nMost of India\u2019s \u201claptop jobs\u201d - mid-tier IT services, low-end finance & legal outsourcing - will vanish. AI isn\u2019t \u201cenhancing\u201d these roles; it\u2019s replacing them.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the future?\n\n> India can become the AI execution layer for global businesses, managing AI workflows and ensuring human-AI collaboration.\n\n\u2014> Or, if we don\u2019t adapt fast enough, AI will simply eliminate the need for most of what India does today.\n\nFor me, it is all about how easily we embrace the shift. But looking at the people around me, I believe the question should be:\n\n\u201cAre we truly ready for this shift?\u201d",

It frees up your team to focus on work that actually moves the business forward.\n\nBut I\u2019ve seen companies go overboard, trying to automate things that need human intuition \u2014 decision-making, creativity, customer relationships. A chatbot can answer questions, but it won\u2019t build trust.

From manufacturing and logistics to customer service and finance, robots, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning are taking over a growing number of jobs.\n\nThe impact of automation on the job market is multifaceted. On the one hand, it can lead to increased efficiency and productivity, allowing businesses to produce goods and services faster and at lower costs. This can benefit consumers through lower prices and improved quality, and it can also lead to economic growth and job creation in new sectors.\nRead more.....",

JOB LOSS & WORKFORCE DISPLACEMENT \u2192 Workforce Decline & Loss of Competitiveness\n\nRisk of Inaction:\n> Loss of global competitiveness \u2013 Companies in China, Germany, and Japan are heavily automating, leading to lower costs & higher efficiency.\n> Fewer jobs in the long run \u2013 AI-resistant companies may lose business, leading to closures and widespread layoffs.\n> Skilled workers moving to AI-driven firms \u2013 Employees will prefer working for high-tech manufacturers, leading to talent drain.\n\n2. HIGH UPRONT COSTS \u2192 Long-Term Financial Decline\n\nRisk of Inaction:\n> Higher long-term operating costs \u2013 Without AI, labor costs rise, & inefficiencies lead to wasted materials and energy.\n> Lost market share \u2013 Companies resisting AI may struggle to compete on price & production speed.\n> Increased error rates & defects \u2013 Manual processes result in more recalls & product failures, damaging brand reputation.\n\n3. INTEGRATION CHALLENGES \u2192 Obsolescence & Inefficiency\n\nRisk of Inaction:\n> Legacy systems become a liability \u2013 Older technology will struggle to integrate with modern supply chains & digital infrastructure.\n> Increased production downtime \u2013 Older equipment lacks predictive maintenance, leading to more frequent breakdowns.\n> Lack of data-driven decision-making \u2013 Companies without AI lose out on real-time analytics, demand forecasting, & process optimization.\n\n4. LACK OF SKILLED WORKFORCE \u2192 Falling Behind in Innovation\n\nRisk of Inaction:\n> Inability to attract talent \u2013 Future workers prefer AI-enabled jobs with automation skills, leaving traditional manufacturers struggling to hire.\n> Competitors outperform with AI-driven efficiency \u2013 Companies that fail to upskill workers will lag behind in productivity, customization, & innovation.\n> Increased labor shortages \u2013 AI-resistant manufacturers will be more vulnerable to worker shortages, especially as older employees retire.\n\n5. RELIABILITY & SECURITY CONCERNS \u2192 Cybersecurity Threats & System Failures\n\nRisk of Inaction:\n> Higher risk of cyberattacks \u2013 AI-powered cybersecurity tools detect threats quickly. Without them, hacking, IP theft, & ransomware attacks increase.\n> More unexpected failures \u2013 AI-driven predictive maintenance reduces equipment breakdowns; manual monitoring increases downtime.\n> Lack of resilience in crises \u2013 AI helps optimize supply chains during disruptions (e.g., COVID-19, trade restrictions, shortages). Without it, companies face longer recovery times.\n\nBOTTOM LINE \u2192 The Cost of Inaction is Higher than the Cost of Adoption\n\n> AI & automation adoption is about efficiency and survival.\n> Companies that fail to automate risk becoming obsolete in 5-10 years.\n\nSOLUTION \u2192 Schedule a Free Strategic AI/Automation Session\n>Text Roy at (919) 589-3580 or Email Nel at\n> Ask about the special offer for reshoring U.S. Manufacturers.",

Autonomation will allow operations to be monitored with constant surveillance, while redundant CPUs control the drilling and blowout preventors. The driller will be freed up to manage and not necessarily be fixated on the process itself. While real world testing is limited there is positive evidence that even in real conditions, the computer will be able to make safe choices. Safety is the main reason for implementing the technology. The process can be dangerous and times before has lead to loss of life because of human error. Although with an implemented assistant who cannot zone out and always is active.

A Call to Solve Real Problems Instead of Trivial Ones\n\nEvery day, we hear about AI-powered robots serving food in restaurants, taking orders in caf\u00e9s, or even mimicking human emotions for entertainment. While these innovations might seem impressive, they often fail to address real, life-threatening challenges that exist in our world.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back and ask: Are we truly utilizing AI\u2019s potential where it matters the most?\n\n-> A Life Lost vs. A Robot Lost\n\nConsider the engine and coupling staff in the. These workers perform dangerous tasks\u2014manually coupling and decoupling train cars, often under extreme conditions. The number of accidental deaths and injuries in this sector is alarming. From 2010 to now, countless railway workers have lost their lives performing duties that could have been automated.\n\nNow, think about this\u2014if a robot were assigned to this task and it malfunctioned or got damaged, we could simply build another one. But when a human life is lost, the impact extends far beyond numbers. Families are shattered, communities suffer, and the loss ripples across generations.\n\nSo why are we investing AI talent into making robots that serve food, rather than robots that could save lives?\n\nA Challenge to AI Engineers: Build for Impact\n\nAs AI engineers, we hold the power to shape the future. Instead of building solutions for convenience, can we shift our focus to real-world problems? Can we create AI-powered robotic systems to handle high-risk jobs in railways, construction, mining, and other dangerous industries?\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a question\u2014it\u2019s a challenge. A call to action for those passionate about AI to rethink where we direct our innovation.\n\nLet\u2019s build technology that matters. Let\u2019s ensure that AI is not just impressive, but impactful.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? How can we drive AI innovation toward solving real-life risks? Drop your insights in the comments!",

Some predict that the 9-to-5 job will be extinct by 2034, while others warn that 300 million full-time jobs worldwide could be replaced by AI.\nBut here\u2019s the real question: Do we actually care?\n\ud83c\udf0d A Generation Rethinking Work\nA recent poll found that:\n\u2705 Three-quarters of Gen Z don\u2019t want a traditional job\n\u2705 One in ten never intend to enter the workforce\n\u2705 Almost half would rather be unemployed than unhappy\nFrom \"tradwives\" rejecting hustle culture to influencers promoting \u201canti-work\u201d lifestyles, there\u2019s a major cultural shift underway. Some see it as resistance to exploitation, while others believe AI has simply arrived at the right time to enable a post-work society.\n\ud83e\udd14 What Happens When AI Automates Everything?\nDuring the pandemic, we got a small glimpse of what a post-work world might feel like\u2014suddenly, only \u201cessential\u201d jobs mattered. But did we use that time for creative growth? Some imagined a renaissance of learning and passion projects, but for many, it became a cycle of gaming, scrolling, and binge-watching.\nThe fear? That AI might not just take away jobs\u2014it might take away our sense of purpose.\n\ud83d\udca1 A Future of Freedom, Not Fear\nAt AI CERTs, we don\u2019t see AI as an existential threat\u2014we see it as a tool to unlock human potential.\n\u2705 AI isn\u2019t here to replace us\u2014it\u2019s here to enhance us. Instead of eliminating work, it allows us to shift toward roles that require creativity, problem-solving, and human connection.\n\u2705 It\u2019s not about job loss\u2014it\u2019s about job transformation. AI will create entirely new career paths, from AI ethics and governance to AI-powered healthcare, education, and sustainability.\n\u2705 The real challenge isn\u2019t automation\u2014it\u2019s adaptation. The key is upskilling and reskilling, preparing ourselves for a future where AI handles routine tasks while we focus on innovation and purpose-driven work.\n\ud83d\udd2e What Comes Next?\nElon Musk says AI will give us our time back. Thinkers like Dario Amodei and Nick Srnicek argue that meaning in life comes from human relationships, not labor. Others fear AI will leave us with more questions than answers.\nAt AI CERTs, we believe that the best way to shape the future is to be ready for it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building the AI+ Certification programs\u2014to empower professionals with the skills they need to thrive in an AI-driven world.\n\ud83d\udce2 What do you think?

The fear of losing jobs or questioning one's current capabilities is a concern for many. However, instead of fearing these advancements, we should see them as opportunities for growth.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1.    AI doesn't replace people, it enhances them. Automation and AI are tools designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, allowing us to focus on higher-value work that requires creativity, emotional intelligence, and problem-solving.\n2.    New skills for a new world. With technological advances come new roles that didn't exist a decade ago. By upskilling and adapting, you can future-proof your career and become more valuable in this AI-driven world.\n3.    Boost in productivity and opportunities. AI isn\u2019t about eliminating jobs but about increasing productivity. This, in turn, creates new opportunities, leading to job roles that are more engaging and fulfilling.\n4.    Stay Ahead of the Competition: Companies that adopt AI and automation early are positioning themselves as industry leaders. By streamlining operations and making data-driven decisions faster, your company can gain a significant competitive edge. The management should view AI not as a threat but as a tool to outpace competitors and drive long-term growth. Embracing AI will empower teams to work smarter, not harder.\n5.    Empowering Teams with Strategic Focus: AI doesn\u2019t replace human intelligence\u2014it frees up valuable time by handling mundane tasks, allowing management to focus on strategic initiatives and innovation. Instead of being bogged down by operational details, managers can dedicate more energy to improving processes, fostering creativity, and leading with a vision. AI is a partner that helps you achieve more, not an obstacle to fear.\n\nLet\u2019s embrace the change, adapt, and learn\u2014because the future is not about being replaced, but about evolving into roles that matter more.",

While these are serious concerns, they aren\u2019t the greatest risk.\n\nThe real danger? AI\u2019s power to erase history and manipulate reality.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen AI-generated deepfakes, revisionist narratives, and algorithmic biases subtly shaping public perception. Imagine a world where AI systems\u2014trained on incomplete, distorted, or outright false data\u2014become the primary source of information. When history is rewritten, when truth is algorithmically adjusted, and when the past becomes whatever those in control want it to be, what happens to society\u2019s ability to think critically and make informed decisions?\n\nThis is not a hypothetical scenario. AI is already influencing what we read, watch, and believe. The challenge ahead is not just about regulation or ethical development\u2014it\u2019s about safeguarding truth itself.\n\nHow do we ensure AI remains a tool for progress rather than a weapon for erasing reality?

        "text": "Title: Embracing AI: A Shift in the Job Landscape\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve and permeate various industries, the discourse around its impact on the job market intensifies. While some fear job displacement, others foresee a transformation in the nature of work. Whichever side of the debate one stands on, there\u2019s no denying that AI is reshaping the employment landscape, compelling us to adapt and innovate.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, automation has been synonymous with job loss. However, history has shown that technological advancements often lead to the creation of new roles and industries. The key lies in how individuals, organizations, and policymakers respond to these shifts. Instead of resisting change, we must embrace it, leveraging AI to enhance productivity, efficiency, and creativity.\n\n\n\nAI excels at repetitive tasks, freeing up human capital to focus on higher-value activities that require emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Consequently, jobs that demand human creativity, empathy, and adaptability are less susceptible to automation. Rather than viewing AI as a threat, we should view it as a tool to augment our capabilities and amplify our impact.\n\n\n\nMoreover, AI is revolutionizing industries by enabling personalized experiences, predictive analytics, and data-driven decision-making. From healthcare to finance, retail to manufacturing, AI-driven insights are driving innovation and unlocking new opportunities. However, this transformation necessitates upskilling and reskilling the workforce to remain relevant in an AI-powered economy.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, as AI takes on mundane tasks, it\u2019s essential to prioritize the ethical and responsible development of AI systems. Ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI algorithms is paramount to mitigate biases and promote trust. Collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and ethicists is crucial to establish guidelines that uphold human values in the age of AI.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of AI presents both challenges and opportunities for the workforce. While certain jobs may become obsolete, new avenues for employment and innovation will emerge. By embracing AI, upskilling our workforce, and fostering ethical AI practices, we can navigate the evolving job landscape with confidence and resilience.",

        "text": "27% of jobs are at high risk of automation, according to the OECD. Almost every profession will be affected by the AI revolution, including HR. But is HR ready for AI?\n\n\ud83c\udf1f, Reshaping Work Fellow, explores this question in our new blog. AI is not only automating and optimising HR processes, it is changing talent management as we know it. Even though AI is destroying certain jobs, overall employment has increased. This creates a tension between job loss and job creation.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Some of Jan's insights are\n1.    AI's impact on HR: Beyond automating tasks, AI is challenging traditional HR models, requiring new approaches to talent management and ethical decision-making.\n2.    Strategic Workforce Management (SWM): HR must adopt data-driven tools to address growing skills gaps and better align talent supply with demand.\n3.    Algorithmic HRM (AHRM): AI-driven decisions are reshaping recruitment, selection and rewards. HR professionals will need to upskill to manage these tools effectively and ethically.\n4.    People-centric and sustainable HR: As regulations push for sustainable and human-centered work environments, HR must adapt and take the lead in creating a balanced AI-human workplace.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Read more about the impact of AI on HR in our new blog post!",

How can you live with yourself? Aren't we just automating jobs away?\n\nThat's a tough one, and I get it. If you've made your money a certain way for a while, disruptive technology... well... Disrupts!\n\nAutomation changes the way we work, no doubt about it. It often makes certain roles obsolete. History has repeatedly shown us that when a door closes, a window opens\u2014often to a room with a much broader view. Remember the Pony Express? Revolutionary in its day, yet it couldn't outpace the advent of the telegraph. And look at us now, communicating across the globe in an instant on LinkedIn. Gone are the days of milling flour by hand, and your daily bread we're all so thankful for, is within easier reach for everyone due to automation.\n\nMy job isn't to replace people with machines; it's to find ways to let machines do the repetitive, boring, tedious stuff so that people can focus on what they're best at \u2014 solving real problems, being creative, creating genuine connections.\n\nThe way I see it, I help people transition from one opportunity to the next, upping their game in a world where change is the only constant.\n\nSure, it's challenging, but it's also exciting. We're not just workers; we're learners and innovators. And if history's shown us anything, it's that, as a species, we're pretty good at adapting.\n\nIf you're not part of the automation process, you will certainly be disrupted BY it. Learn the trade being created by the automation, rather than defending the trade supplanted by it. The microwave has saved countless hours of toil. Restaurants learned to harness the power of microwave technology to make better food faster, rather than trying to outlaw them. Not all food comes out quite right when microwaved... and not every job can be replaced by AI... but the jobs will surely change. People won't be directly replaced by AI, but those who know how to use it will surely replace those who don't.\n\nLet\u2019s not fear automation. Let's use it as a tool to create a future where work is more about what we bring to the table as humans \u2014 creativity, empathy, innovation. Recognize how AI impacts your profession so you can shape that future rather than become a victim of it. Become the first tailor to master the sewing machine. Let's brainstorm that future together to make it one we're proud of.",

Following is what I learned and presented to the audiences.\nThe six key components of AI (Artificial Intelligence) are foundational elements that contribute to the creation and functionality of intelligent systems. These components work together to allow AI to perform tasks like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. These six components are often integrated to build AI systems that can perform tasks autonomously or assist humans in various industries, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and robotics.\nWhile AI is expected to displace certain jobs\n, it also offers potential for new job creation\nthrough increased productivity and economic growth. For instance, a report suggests that AI could raise GDP by up to 6% by 2035 in the UK, though it may result in the loss of 1 to 3 million private sector jobs\n. To address these challenges, proactive measures such as reskilling programs\n, educational reforms, and collaborative efforts between governments, industries, and unions are essential to mitigate the adverse effects of AI on employment.\nAs AI continues to reshape the workforce, there is a broader ethical question\nabout who is responsible for addressing the negative impacts of\n. Should governments provide a safety net for displaced workers? Should companies bear the responsibility for retraining workers and ensuring fair access to AI benefits\n? The question of who bears the ethical burden of AI\u2019s impact on employment is complex and requires thoughtful policy discussions.\nWhile AI has the potential to drive economic growth\nand innovation, its impact on employment brings up important ethical considerations regarding fairness\n. Addressing these concerns requires a collaborative approach involving government policy, corporate responsibility, and the active involvement of workers and communities. Fairness in AI deployment must prioritize inclusivity, transparency, and social equity to ensure that the benefits of AI\nare widely shared, rather than exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,",

While it\u2019s streamlining candidate sourcing and helping companies move faster, it\u2019s also creating new challenges.\nRecently, I worked with a candidate who was initially screened out by an AI-driven system\u2014despite having the exact skills and experience required. When I manually reviewed their profile, it was clear they were not only qualified but an ideal fit for the role. After pushing them through to the hiring manager, they ended up landing the job.\nThis is why human oversight in recruiting still matters. AI can filter resumes, but it can\u2019t assess potential, adaptability, or the nuances of someone\u2019s career journey the way a skilled recruiter can.\nTechnology should enhance hiring, not replace the human element.

        "text": "Lately I've heard top AI companies offering seven-figure packages for specialized talent from San Francisco to Singapore \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2 U.S. reports confirm this: AI roles saw 10.4% wage growth in 2024 (3x national average) according to Veritone, with AI freelancers earning 21-40% more than peers per Oxford Institute research.\n\n\ud83c\udf0e We validated this with Deel's global data spanning 150+ countries across full-time and contract roles. Turns out, these trends are even more pronounced globally:\n\n- Contracts with \"AI\" in job titles surged 585% from 2023 to 2024\n- We've processed more AI-related contracts in 2025 than in all of 2023\n- AI Engineers saw a 340% increase in contracts, while senior AI leadership roles tripled\n- The median AI salary is 120% higher than all other roles \u2013 up 6% YoY\n\nWhat's the impact? In the short-term: a widening pay gap between AI and traditional tech positions. But in the long-term: I see three major shifts coming:\n\ud83d\udcc8 1 - Rising compensation across tech roles as market adjustments ripple out\n\ud83d\udcb0 2 - Premium salaries for professionals combining AI with domain expertise (finance, healthcare, etc)\n\ud83c\udf10 3 - Innovation hubs diversifying globally beyond traditional tech centers\n\nThe AI talent wars will rewrite the global playbook for how technical talent is valued everywhere.\n\nWhat are you seeing? I'd love to hear from others who\u2019ve experienced this firsthand. And we\u2019ll unpack this global trend more deeply in our upcoming AI Jobs Report \u2013 stay tuned.",

AI is making work more fluid, where skills and problem-solving ability matter more than a fixed job title.\n\n\u2705 Human-AI Collaboration is the Future\nKnowing how to use AI effectively will be as important as knowing your industry. AI literacy, strategic thinking, and adaptability are becoming must-have skills.\n\n\u2705 Emotional Intelligence Will Be a Career Superpower\nAI can automate tasks, but it can\u2019t lead teams, inspire creativity, or navigate complex human relationships.

Many employees brought back to physical offices are unknowingly participating in their own replacement - training the AI systems that will eventually automate significant portions of their roles.\n\nThe future won't be 9-5 office jobs, but human-in-the-loop validation roles with compensation tied directly to outcomes.

The promise? Faster, more efficient, and data-driven hiring decisions. But the big question remains: Can AI truly understand human potential?\n\nMany organizations are adopting AI-powered recruitment tools to eliminate human bias, streamline processes, and improve candidate matching. However, critics argue that AI might be reinforcing biases instead of removing them. After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.\nThe Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring\n\n\u2705 Why AI is a Game-Changer:\n\u2714 Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.\n\u2714 Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.\n\u2714 Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.\n\n\u26a0 Concerns About AI in Recruitment:\n\u274c Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.\n\u274c Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?\n\u274c Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.\nWith technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?\n\n\ud83d\udcac We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Intuitively they know that something is terribly wrong. But job seekers - the good ones - think it must be them. There is something that they are not doing right. A broken job market simply translates into frustration, hopelessness, and a sense of desperation for our citizens. We can do better. We must do better, especially as we face the pace of change that AI is triggering on a global scale.\n\nGovernments, business leaders, hiring managers, and HR have a role to play in why the market is the way it is.\nAlthough the article provides some interesting insights into how AI can address this problem and fix the broken labor market, I disagree that AI can fix this.\nAI cannot fix greed and stupidity and disregard for our fellow citizens. However, there are strategies and pushbacks that we as a society can do. I will write more about this in my next post.\n\nWhat are your thoughts to address the broken labor market?",

This shift may seem like jobs are disappearing, but in truth, new opportunities are emerging just as quickly.\n\nAlbert Einstein famously said, \"In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.\" This is exactly the case with AI.

But in the long-term: I see three major shifts coming:\n\ud83d\udcc8 1 - Rising compensation across tech roles as market adjustments ripple out\n\ud83d\udcb0 2 - Premium salaries for professionals combining AI with domain expertise (finance, healthcare, etc)\n\ud83c\udf10 3 - Innovation hubs diversifying globally beyond traditional tech centers\n\nThe AI talent wars will rewrite the global playbook for how technical talent is valued everywhere.\n\nWhat are you seeing? I'd love to hear from others who\u2019ve experienced this firsthand. And we\u2019ll unpack this global trend more deeply in our upcoming AI Jobs Report \u2013 stay tuned.",

As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.\n\nIf the US faces a recession in 2025, it will \"Turbocharge\" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapore\u2019s economic growth to be between 1% and 3%\u2014a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.\n\nAt the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.\n\nLooking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globally\u2014but we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.\n\nThe key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?\n\nWhat do you think?",

After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.\nThe Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring\n\n\u2705 Why AI is a Game-Changer:\n\u2714 Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.\n\u2714 Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.\n\u2714 Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.\n\n\u26a0 Concerns About AI in Recruitment:\n\u274c Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.\n\u274c Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?\n\u274c Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.\nWith technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?\n\n\ud83d\udcac We'd love to hear your thoughts!

They\u2019re designed to replace high-income professionals\u2014coding, research, problem-solving, even hypothesis testing.\n\n\u2022 SoftBank just threw $3 billion at this.

While many discussions point to AI as the cause of job losses, the reality is different.\n\nThese layoffs are primarily driven by internal optimizations, restructuring, and cost-cutting efforts, rather than   at scale. Despite its rapid advancements, AI is still far from significantly impacting tech employment today.\n\nThe industry is evolving, and while automation will reshape certain roles, human expertise, problem-solving, and creativity remain irreplaceable.

Conversely, as Ai automates 29.5% of current work hours by 2030, the potential for new job creation remains substantial.\n\nThe World Economic Forum anticipates 97 million new roles emerging by 2025, partially offsetting the 85 million jobs that could be displaced, emphasising a need for workforce transformation.\n\nCrucially, this transition underscores the importance of upskilling, emphasising human skills such as creativity and collaboration, which remain irreplaceable by AI.\n\nWhat are you thoughts?\n\nHow can organisations balance the need for technological adoption with safeguarding human employment?\n\n\n\n** new weekly schedule from\n\n***News - Tuesday & Thursday (I know its Monday night \ud83e\udd14)\n***Deeper content - Wednesdays\n\n****Coming soon - on the Youtube channel, Ai uses cases through a recruitment lens.\n\nIf you looking to introduce Ai into your business, but do not know where to start contact me at- \"Innovate Today, Lead Tomorrow\"",

About 36% of occupations see AI used in at least a quarter of their tasks, while only 4% use it for three-quarters of their tasks.\n\n- AI is more about augmentation (57%) than automation (43%)\u2014meaning it\u2019s enhancing human work rather than replacing it outright.\n\n- AI usage is highest in mid-to-high-wage jobs like programming and data science. It\u2019s notably lower in both the lowest- and highest-paid jobs, likely due to AI\u2019s current limitations and practical adoption barriers.\n\n- Both low-wage and ultra-high-wage roles see little AI adoption\u2014jobs requiring manual dexterity (like shampooers) or specialized human expertise (like obstetricians) are less affected. Instead, it\u2019s the mid-to-high earners\u2014think programmers and copywriters\u2014who are the biggest AI users today.\n\nLink to the report in the comments.",

The company is focusing on AI-driven efficiencies in customer service and other operations. with AI. From customer service chatbots to fraud detection, loan approvals, and even marketing automation, AI is now handling tasks that once required human effort. The company plans to further decrease its headcount to around 2,000 employees.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about cost-cutting\u2014it\u2019s about efficiency.

Focus on skills like problem-solving, decision-making, and emotional intelligence.\n\u2705 Find ways to work with AI, not against it \u2013 The most valuable employees will be those who know how to use AI to enhance their work rather than resist it.\n\u2705 Explore entrepreneurial opportunities \u2013 AI is opening new business models. Could you leverage AI to start something of your own?\n\u2705 Stay adaptable \u2013 The job market is shifting fast. Continuous learning is no longer optional; it\u2019s the key to staying relevant.\n\nI see both sides: AI is unlocking new levels of efficiency, but it also challenges how we define work and how we prepare for the future.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take?

New technologies and trends are reshaping industries and creating new career opportunities that were unimaginable just a few years ago. One such technology that is revolutionizing the job market is artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular, the role it is playing in transforming the job market is in focus. In this article, we will explore how AI is shaping the future of work, and why business executives, techpreneurs, AI strategists, emerging technology experts, founders, and thought leaders should be excited about the new and exciting job roles and skills that are emerging as a result.\n\nYou may have heard the doomsayers predicting that AI will replace jobs, leading to mass unemployment and economic upheaval. But the reality is far more nuanced. AI is not just about replacing humans; it is about enhancing human capabilities and creating new job opportunities that were previously unimaginable. In fact, a recent study by McKinsey found that AI has the potential to create an additional 20 million jobs globally by 2030. These jobs will require a new set of skills,...",

Fully automated AI replacing $100K/year jobs, unlocking massive value for startups.\n\nBut here\u2019s the paradox: while YC fuels the hype, the reality looks far less promising :\n- AI agents lack counter-positioning. As we know it, disruptive startups succeed by turning incumbents\u2019 strengths into weaknesses\u2014just like Netflix did when it cannibalized Blockbuster\u2019s business model with a frictionless subscription. But AI agents don\u2019t force incumbents into a dilemma since they can integrate these tools effortlessly, leveraging their distribution power and datasets.\n\n- YC is its own nemesis. The very dev tools YC backs are making software absurdly easy to build, allowing companies to create their own AI-powered solutions instead of relying on startups.is already leading this shift, embracing AI to internalize software development and reduce reliance on third-party SaaS.\n\n- The AI pyramid is crumbling. While many believe the AI market is structured as a layered pyramid where application-layer startups can thrive,is proving otherwise. Indeed, new tools like Deep Research help OpenAI escape the commoditization of foundational models, securing its place as a product company controlling user experience, absorbing value that was supposed to flow to application-layer startups, and positioning itself as the dominant interface for AI-powered work.\n\nSo why does YC keep pushing AI agents?\n\nBecause VCs don\u2019t just invest out of conviction\u2014they also invest out of necessity. With billions to deploy, they fund as many startups as possible, knowing most will fail. Being VC-backed doesn\u2019t mean a startup is onto something big\u2014it often just means an investor had no better place to park their money.\n\nBelow is my full take on the topic.

This matches what I've seen on the ground, especially in highly regulated fields like finance or fintech: AI enhances analysis but doesn't replace judgment.\n\nMost telling: AI adoption clusters in mid-to-high salary knowledge work. Senior executives and physical laborers both show minimal AI impact. This tracks - AI excels at processing information, not at either making complex strategic decisions or performing physical tasks.\n\nHere's the stat you should watch out for: Only 4% of jobs heavily use AI, but 36% are starting to experiment. We're seeing more \"Microsoft Excel for knowledge work\" than \"robots taking jobs.\"\n\nQuestion for my finance folks: How do we value productivity gains from AI augmentation vs cost savings from automation? The data suggest we might be looking at the wrong metrics.\n\nInterested? Read more about this fascinating work here:",

High-skill roles, particularly in software and data science, face increasing AI exposure\u2014about one-third of U.S. jobs are at risk.\n\nOffshoring has already reshaped the job market. In 2022, businesses spent over $700 billion on outsourcing, with IT services accounting for $519 billion. By 2024, roughly 300,000 U.S. jobs were offshored annually. Despite high domestic demand, cost pressures continue shifting jobs overseas.\nHistory shows that widespread job displacement isn\u2019t just a worker issue\u2014it ripples through entire economies. The decline of manufacturing hollowed out the Rust Belt, leading to lasting economic decline. Tech once filled the void left by manufacturing, but today, no clear successor exists.\n\nThe immediate cost savings of AI-driven automation and offshoring may come at the expense of long-term economic stability. Without careful planning, the same cycle of job loss and economic decline could repeat.\n\nBalancing innovation and efficiency with economic resilience requires strategic foresight. Companies and policymakers must ensure technological progress benefits the many, not just the few.",

While the technology is impressive, what really resonates is how it's transforming daily work life.\n\nWe're seeing teams spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time on work that energises them. But here's what's crucial - this isn't about replacing people. It's about amplifying what they do best.\n\nTake our Care of One\u2122 platform. When we say it delivers 30% improvement in user experience, that translates to real people getting home earlier, feeling less frustrated, and having more energy for creative work.\n\nThis isn't just about efficiency - it's about giving people back their time and headspace. Because when teams feel supported and empowered, that's when innovation happens.\n\nCurious to learn more? You can check out Vijay's full article in the comments \ud83d\udc47",

A lot of hiring managers are realizing demonstrated ability is a better predictor of job performance.\n\n2. AI is reshaping recruitment. \ud83e\udd16\n\nAI is screening resumes, sourcing and matching talent, and taking first-round interviews. Companies using AI can potentially make faster, better hires and candidates who know how to work with it will have an advantage. It\u2019s a powerful tool, but it still works best alongside human judgment, not instead of.\n\n3. The global talent war is heating up. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nGlobal talent hubs like Mexico, Poland, and Vietnam are seeing rapid growth. At the same time, high-cost markets (think NYC, London, and SF) are losing top talent to flexible, distributed teams.\n\n4. Increased time-to-hire. \u23f3\n\n60% of organizations reported an increase in time-to-hire in 2024, with interview cancellations and rescheduling being the primary bottlenecks. Making AI integration more important to help cut delays and improve efficiency (Remote has some announcements soon to help with this!! \ud83e\udd16).\n\n5. Passive vs active job seekers. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u2642\ufe0f\n\n60% of American workers are passive candidates - not actively applying but open to opportunities. Hiring teams relying on inbound applications risk missing top talent.\n\nWhat this means for hiring managers:\n\n\u2705 Filtering by degree could cost you great talent. Skills-based hiring gives you access to candidates with real-world experience.\n\n\u2705 Using AI alongside recruiter judgment leads to stronger hiring decisions. It streamlines the process, but human oversight remains key.\n\n\u2705 Talent is moving beyond traditional hubs. Expanding your search to global talent markets (Mexico, Poland, Vietnam) can give you access to highly skilled candidates at competitive rates.\n\n\u2705 Top talent isn\u2019t always actively applying.

When creativity, emotional intelligence or strategic thinking is needed, humans outperform AI.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Cost & Scalability\n\nWith no large salaries, tax contributions or onboarding costs, there's usually opportunity to scale output more cost effectively using AI, but it comes down to the task. Complex tasks need complex systems which, while scalable, require upfront costs and maintenance.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Technology Integration\n\nImplementing AI requires infrastructure, investment, and training. While integration is getting smoother, there's still a transition period where training and testing is required, so hiring may be simpler and quicker in these instances.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Human Resource Development\n\nThe side many people don't focus on - training employees alongside AI increases job satisfaction. Employees develop new skills and have more time to prioritise their focus.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Ethical and Cultural Considerations\n\nMorale amongst your team is key. Clear communication about AI's role is important to empower staff rather than create uncertainty. Transparency is also required for customer-facing AI integrations.\n\n\nThe best approach?\n\nFocus on hiring for strategic and leadership roles but for others, empower existing teams with AI capabilities rather than just adding to the headcount.\n\nThis way you'll maximise output, manage costs and maintain staff morale.",

While AI is eliminating repetitive, low-value tasks, it\u2019s also opening up new roles and opportunities in areas like:\nAI Implementation \u2013 Companies need specialists to integrate and maintain AI solutions.\n\nData Interpretation \u2013 Humans are still essential to contextualize and apply AI-driven insights.\nCreative Problem-Solving \u2013 Innovation requires human ingenuity, something AI has yet to master.\n\nA recent study by McKinsey found that 60% of jobs will require hybrid skills\u2014technical knowledge paired with creativity, communication, and critical thinking. The winners in this new landscape will be those who adapt quickly, upskilling to stay ahead of these trends.\n\nHow Companies Are Responding\n\nLeading organizations are approaching the AI shift strategically:\n\ud83d\udd0d Upskilling programs \u2013 Investing in employee development to match evolving tech demands.\n\ud83d\udd0d AI collaboration \u2013 Viewing AI as a tool to enhance productivity, not replace workers.\n\ud83d\udd0d New job creation \u2013 Roles like AI trainers, automation analysts, and data strategists are becoming crucial.\n\nWhat This Means for You\n\nWhether you're an entrepreneur, manager, or employee, staying on top of industry trends is non-negotiable. Success will belong to those who continually learn, pivot, and embrace innovation.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 How do you see AI and automation impacting your role or industry?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Drop your thoughts in the comments!

The analysis highlights that well-educated professionals in major metros like San Francisco, San Jose, Washington, D.C., and New York could see significant changes in their work as AI takes on more cognitive tasks such as coding, research, and content creation. While this technology could boost productivity in some instances, it also brings the risk of job displacement\u2014a twist from previous automation trends that mostly impacted blue-collar and rural jobs.

Skills > Degrees. \ud83c\udf93\n\n1 in 3 companies are ditching degree requirements and going all-in on skills-first hiring.is part of this shift, only considering education if required (law degrees, etc). A lot of hiring managers are realizing demonstrated ability is a better predictor of job performance.\n\n2. AI is reshaping recruitment. \ud83e\udd16\n\nAI is screening resumes, sourcing and matching talent, and taking first-round interviews. Companies using AI can potentially make faster, better hires and candidates who know how to work with it will have an advantage. It\u2019s a powerful tool, but it still works best alongside human judgment, not instead of.\n\n3. The global talent war is heating up. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nGlobal talent hubs like Mexico, Poland, and Vietnam are seeing rapid growth. At the same time, high-cost markets (think NYC, London, and SF) are losing top talent to flexible, distributed teams.\n\n4. Increased time-to-hire. \u23f3\n\n60% of organizations reported an increase in time-to-hire in 2024, with interview cancellations and rescheduling being the primary bottlenecks. Making AI integration more important to help cut delays and improve efficiency (Remote has some announcements soon to help with this!! \ud83e\udd16).\n\n5. Passive vs active job seekers. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u2642\ufe0f\n\n60% of American workers are passive candidates - not actively applying but open to opportunities. Hiring teams relying on inbound applications risk missing top talent.\n\nWhat this means for hiring managers:\n\n\u2705 Filtering by degree could cost you great talent. Skills-based hiring gives you access to candidates with real-world experience.\n\n\u2705 Using AI alongside recruiter judgment leads to stronger hiring decisions. It streamlines the process, but human oversight remains key.\n\n\u2705 Talent is moving beyond traditional hubs. Expanding your search to global talent markets (Mexico, Poland, Vietnam) can give you access to highly skilled candidates at competitive rates.\n\n\u2705 Top talent isn\u2019t always actively applying. Proactive sourcing is still important, and with 800M+ candidate profiles, Remote Recruit can help you find the best fit.\n\nMore data and exciting announcements coming soon!\n\nSources: Forbes, Payscale 2024 Compensation Best Practices Report, Good Time 2025 Hiring Statistics, Jobvite, Harvard Business Review, LinkedIn 2024 Workplace Report & SHRM AI Hiring Trends, World Economic Forum, LinkedIn Workforce Report & NPR\u2019s labor market studies.\n\nRemote \ud83d\udc9c",

When creativity, emotional intelligence or strategic thinking is needed, humans outperform AI.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Cost & Scalability\n\nWith no large salaries, tax contributions or onboarding costs, there's usually opportunity to scale output more cost effectively using AI, but it comes down to the task. Complex tasks need complex systems which, while scalable, require upfront costs and maintenance.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Technology Integration\n\nImplementing AI requires infrastructure, investment, and training. While integration is getting smoother, there's still a transition period where training and testing is required, so hiring may be simpler and quicker in these instances.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Human Resource Development\n\nThe side many people don't focus on - training employees alongside AI increases job satisfaction. Employees develop new skills and have more time to prioritise their focus.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Ethical and Cultural Considerations\n\nMorale amongst your team is key. Clear communication about AI's role is important to empower staff rather than create uncertainty. Transparency is also required for customer-facing AI integrations.\n\n\nThe best approach?\n\nFocus on hiring for strategic and leadership roles but for others, empower existing teams with AI capabilities rather than just adding to the headcount.\n\nThis way you'll maximise output, manage costs and maintain staff morale.",

But here\u2019s what is missing from the conversation: Who is going to build, manage, and govern all this AI?\n\nI\u2019ve seen companies pour millions into AI, expecting instant results - only to realize they don\u2019t have the right people to make it work. They assume hiring AI professionals is simple, but the truth is AI talent is scarce, the best candidates have multiple offers, and AI hiring tools are eliminating qualified people before a human even sees their resume.\n\nWe are now in a situation where:\n- Companies desperately need AI talent but can\u2019t find it\n- AI hiring systems are making the problem worse\n- Most organizations are not investing in AI reskilling for their workforce\n\nAI cannot run itself. Companies who want to succeed need to:\n- Invest in AI training and reskilling, not just external hiring\n- Fix AI hiring systems so they don\u2019t filter out great candidates\n- Prioritize real skills and problem-solving over rigid job descriptions\n\nAt, we have build AI models that work in real business environments, and I can tell you this - technology is never the hardest part. The hardest part is finding and developing the right people.\n\nIf businesses don\u2019t fix this now, they\u2019ll struggle - not because they lack AI, but because they lack the workforce to make it work.\n\nWhat is your company doing to build its AI workforce?

The promise? Faster, more efficient, and data-driven hiring decisions. But the big question remains: Can AI truly understand human potential?\n\nMany organizations are adopting AI-powered recruitment tools to eliminate human bias, streamline processes, and improve candidate matching. However, critics argue that AI might be reinforcing biases instead of removing them. After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.\nThe Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring\n\n\u2705 Why AI is a Game-Changer:\n\u2714 Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.\n\u2714 Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.\n\u2714 Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.\n\n\u26a0 Concerns About AI in Recruitment:\n\u274c Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.\n\u274c Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?\n\u274c Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.\nWith technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?\n\n\ud83d\udcac We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Reports from policymakers and industry leaders celebrate the promise of reskilling, insisting that workers will seamlessly transition into new careers.\n\nBut history tells a different story. Disruption is not neutral. Entire industries have crumbled under automation, leaving behind workers who lacked the time, resources, or opportunities to pivot. The numbers on AI-driven job creation often ignore the cost of transition\u2014the financial strain, the gaps in retraining, and the reality that new roles rarely emerge where old ones disappear.\n\nThis is why education cannot take a backseat in the AI conversation. Unlike industries chasing short-term efficiency, education\u2019s mandate is long-term: to preserve dignity, foster resilience, and ensure people are not left behind.\nIn my latest article, I explore:\n\n\u2705 Why the standard reskilling narrative is inadequate\n\u2705 How Further Education colleges are leading AI adoption responsibly\n\u2705 What businesses must learn from education before making costly AI missteps\n\nAI is reshaping the workforce.

While AI certainly offers incredible benefits, such as speeding up the screening process, it got me thinking: Are we overlooking something critical?\n\nThe video highlighted how many qualified candidates are getting automatically rejected by AI-powered systems due to overly rigid screening functions. These systems might not fully capture a candidate's potential, missing out on those who could be a perfect fit for the role but don\u2019t quite meet the keyword-heavy criteria set by the algorithm.\n\nThis is where recruiters continue to be absolutely fundamental to the process. \ud83e\udd1d\n\nWhile AI can help us sort through massive pools of applicants, it\u2019s the human touch that ensures no good candidate falls through the cracks. We bring context, understanding, and a level of empathy that technology just can\u2019t replace.\n\nAt the end of the day, AI is a tool, but it\u2019s the recruiter\u2019s expertise and intuition that really connects the dots and builds the most successful teams. \ud83d\ude80",

High-skill roles, particularly in software and data science, face increasing AI exposure\u2014about one-third of U.S. jobs are at risk.\n\nOffshoring has already reshaped the job market. In 2022, businesses spent over $700 billion on outsourcing, with IT services accounting for $519 billion. By 2024, roughly 300,000 U.S. jobs were offshored annually. Despite high domestic demand, cost pressures continue shifting jobs overseas.\nHistory shows that widespread job displacement isn\u2019t just a worker issue\u2014it ripples through entire economies. The decline of manufacturing hollowed out the Rust Belt, leading to lasting economic decline. Tech once filled the void left by manufacturing, but today, no clear successor exists.\n\nThe immediate cost savings of AI-driven automation and offshoring may come at the expense of long-term economic stability. Without careful planning, the same cycle of job loss and economic decline could repeat.\n\nBalancing innovation and efficiency with economic resilience requires strategic foresight. Companies and policymakers must ensure technological progress benefits the many, not just the few.",

Why?\nBecause AI models need data \u2014 clean, structured, meaningful data \u2014 and real data science knowledge to train, optimize, and continuously improve those models.\n\nWithout that foundation, you\u2019re not getting AI \u2014 you\u2019re getting automation theater.\n\nIf you\u2019re investing in AI, ask the hard questions:\n\u2022 Who is building the models?\n\u2022 What\u2019s their experience with data science and ML engineering?\n\u2022 How will they handle your data \u2014 from preprocessing to model monitoring?\n\nReal AI is 80% data work and 20% modeling magic. Skip the first part, and you don\u2019t have AI \u2014 you have a marketing gimmick.\n\nHas your company faced this challenge? Let\u2019s discuss \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear your experiences.",

A lot of hiring managers are realizing demonstrated ability is a better predictor of job performance.\n\n2. AI is reshaping recruitment. \ud83e\udd16\n\nAI is screening resumes, sourcing and matching talent, and taking first-round interviews. Companies using AI can potentially make faster, better hires and candidates who know how to work with it will have an advantage. It\u2019s a powerful tool, but it still works best alongside human judgment, not instead of.\n\n3. The global talent war is heating up. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nGlobal talent hubs like Mexico, Poland, and Vietnam are seeing rapid growth. At the same time, high-cost markets (think NYC, London, and SF) are losing top talent to flexible, distributed teams.\n\n4. Increased time-to-hire. \u23f3\n\n60% of organizations reported an increase in time-to-hire in 2024, with interview cancellations and rescheduling being the primary bottlenecks. Making AI integration more important to help cut delays and improve efficiency (Remote has some announcements soon to help with this!! \ud83e\udd16).\n\n5. Passive vs active job seekers. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u2642\ufe0f\n\n60% of American workers are passive candidates - not actively applying but open to opportunities. Hiring teams relying on inbound applications risk missing top talent.\n\nWhat this means for hiring managers:\n\n\u2705 Filtering by degree could cost you great talent. Skills-based hiring gives you access to candidates with real-world experience.\n\n\u2705 Using AI alongside recruiter judgment leads to stronger hiring decisions. It streamlines the process, but human oversight remains key.\n\n\u2705 Talent is moving beyond traditional hubs. Expanding your search to global talent markets (Mexico, Poland, Vietnam) can give you access to highly skilled candidates at competitive rates.\n\n\u2705 Top talent isn\u2019t always actively applying.

AI in ATS systems promises to fix that\u2014but does it actually help, or is it just another buzzword?\n\nWhere AI Can Actually Make a Difference\n\n\u2705 Faster CV Screening \u2013 AI can scan and rank candidates based on skills, experience, and relevance in seconds. No more manual filtering through hundreds of applications.\n\n\u2705 Smarter Matching \u2013 Instead of just looking for keywords, AI can identify similar roles, transferable skills, and career patterns to surface strong candidates recruiters might overlook.\n\n\u2705 Reducing Bias (If Built Properly) \u2013 AI doesn\u2019t have gut feelings or unconscious preferences, but it\u2019s only as fair as the data it\u2019s trained on. If designed right, it could help level the playing field.\n\n\u2705 Better Outreach \u2013 AI could predict when someone might be open to a job move based on industry trends and career history, making outreach more targeted instead of just cold emailing.\n\nWhere AI Falls Short\n\n\u274c It Won\u2019t Replace Recruiters \u2013 AI can prioritise CVs, but hiring isn\u2019t just a data problem. Relationships, gut instinct, and human judgement still matter.\n\n\u274c It\u2019s Only as Good as Its Training \u2013 If an AI is trained on bad hiring data, it will make bad hiring decisions. It needs human oversight to avoid reinforcing biases or filtering out good candidates.\n\nSo, will recruiters trust AI?\n\nRight now, most don\u2019t\u2014because AI in hiring is still a black box. If an ATS rejects a great candidate, recruiters need to know why. If AI is going to be useful, it has to be transparent, accurate, and actually save time, not add another layer of admin.\n\nWhat do you think\u2014has AI actually made recruitment easier, or is it just another shiny feature?",

But here's what's crucial - this isn't about replacing people. It's about amplifying what they do best.\n\nTake our Care of One\u2122 platform. When we say it delivers 30% improvement in user experience, that translates to real people getting home earlier, feeling less frustrated, and having more energy for creative work.\n\nThis isn't just about efficiency - it's about giving people back their time and headspace.

Economic downturns, inflated promises of \u201cskills shortages,\u201d and automation hype have all contributed to a hiring slowdown. But one factor looms large in the discussion: AI.\n\nMany believe AI can take over cybersecurity roles, especially those involving data-heavy tasks like log analysis and triage. And while AI is a powerful tool, it\u2019s just that\u2014a tool. The reality is, AI is best at detecting computer-driven threats, but it struggles with novel, human-led attacks. Adversaries know this. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve pivoted toward sophisticated, human-driven intrusions that AI simply can\u2019t catch on its own.\n\nThe future of cybersecurity isn\u2019t AI replacing analysts\u2014it\u2019s analysts learning to leverage AI effectively. The next generation of security professionals must evolve, focusing on proactive threat hunting, fine-tuning automation, and staying ahead of AI-empowered adversaries.\n\nCybersecurity leaders, are you adapting your hiring and training strategies to this reality? .",

However, beyond the business benefits, there are ethical and moral challenges to consider - such as job displacement, algorithmic bias, and the diminishing of human control. As companies adopt AI, the focus shifts not only to what AI is capable of but also to what it should be tasked with.\n\nThe following is a high-level article delving into the themes of progress and accountability in the complex, and often uncertain, early stages of AI integration into the human workforce.",

Instead of replacing jobs, AI is shifting what work looks like, how we structure careers, and what skills actually matter.\n\nSo, what do you need to stay ahead? Here are three key shifts happening right now:\n\n\u2705 Outcome-Based Work Over Job Titles\nForget rigid job descriptions. AI is making work more fluid, where skills and problem-solving ability matter more than a fixed job title.\n\n\u2705 Human-AI Collaboration is the Future\nKnowing how to use AI effectively will be as important as knowing your industry. AI literacy, strategic thinking, and adaptability are becoming must-have skills.\n\n\u2705 Emotional Intelligence Will Be a Career Superpower\nAI can automate tasks, but it can\u2019t lead teams, inspire creativity, or navigate complex human relationships. Soft skills are about to become hard currency.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 The takeaway? Don\u2019t fear AI, embrace it and redefine your role alongside it.

Many employees brought back to physical offices are unknowingly participating in their own replacement - training the AI systems that will eventually automate significant portions of their roles.\n\nThe future won't be 9-5 office jobs, but human-in-the-loop validation roles with compensation tied directly to outcomes.

Some roles may shrink, others may disappear, and entirely new ones will emerge. But what does that mean for paychecks?\n\nHistorically, technology has both displaced and created jobs. The key question is whether AI will enhance human productivity (leading to higher wages) or replace certain tasks to the point where pay declines.\n\nIf AI makes work more efficient, will companies reinvest those savings into higher wages? Or will they see it as an opportunity to cut costs?\n\nThe answer likely depends on how businesses, policymakers, and workers adapt.

The big question is no longer if we should embrace AI, but how we can harness its potential to elevate the HR function.\n\nAs HR leaders, we have already built strong partnerships with CFOs. Now, a new frontier awaits; collaborating with our CTOs to drive AI innovation and reimagine the workforce. But with AI automating many operational tasks, are we truly ready to step up as \"visionary job architects\"?\n\nIn my latest (March 2025) Strategic HR Leadership article series, I explore:\n\ud83d\udccc What AI and Generative AI really mean for HR\n\ud83d\udccc The evolving relationship between the CPO and CTO in the AI era\n\ud83d\udccc How AI can take over repetitive HR tasks and unlock strategic value\n\ud83d\udccc The emerging role of HR in designing future jobs and upskilling talent\n\nAI is not here to replace us.

As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.\n\nIf the US faces a recession in 2025, it will \"Turbocharge\" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapore\u2019s economic growth to be between 1% and 3%\u2014a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.\n\nAt the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.\n\nLooking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globally\u2014but we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.\n\nThe key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?\n\nWhat do you think?",

But the reality is far more exciting and full of opportunity.\n\nAs Human + Machine puts it:\n\n\u201cThe simple truth is that machines are not taking over the world, nor are they obviating the need for humans in the workplace. In this current era of business process transformation, AI systems are not replacing us wholesale; rather, they are amplifying our skills and collaborating with us to achieve productivity gains that have previously been impossible.\u201d\n\nRather than replacing jobs, AI is changing them. The real power of AI lies in complementing and augmenting human capabilities.\n\n\u201cBut what we\u2019ve found in our research is that although AI can be deployed to automate certain tasks, the technology\u2019s greater power is in complementing and augmenting human capabilities.\u201d\n\nAtwe see this transformation firsthand. AI is helping our global teams work smarter, not harder\u2014automating repetitive tasks, unlocking new efficiencies, and allowing our staff to focus on higher-value work that requires human intelligence, creativity, and emotional connection.\n\n\u201cthose companies that are using machines with a narrow view to replace humans will eventually stall, whereas those that think of innovative ways for machines to augment humans will become the leaders of their industries.\u201d\n\nThe future isn\u2019t AI vs. humans\u2014it\u2019s AI + humans.

No need for the DA and Excel!\n\nThe manager can be replaced with an AI Agent who can create, compile, summaries all the reports and send them to the senior manager. This will remove a lot of middle layers between higher management and workers who can't to be replaced by AI Agents.

Women, Black, and Latino workers are underrepresented in STEM fields, and the increased demand for STEM skills due to AI could widen gender, racial, and ethnic wage gaps if not addressed proactively.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Job Creation and Transformation\n\nWhile AI may automate some jobs, it also has the potential to create new ones. The integration of AI into the workforce could lead to the emergence of new roles that require human oversight, creativity, and emotional intelligence.\n\nAI could complement human workers by taking over routine tasks, allowing employees to focus on more creative and strategic aspects of their jobs. This could lead to a more innovative and adaptable workforce.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Education and Workforce Development\n\nTo mitigate the negative impacts of AI on the workforce, it is essential to invest in education and workforce development. Continuous training and upskilling in new technologies like AI are crucial for the current workforce to adapt to the changing job market.\n\nPolicies that encourage responsible AI use and promote continual learning are necessary to ensure that the benefits of AI are widely distributed and that marginalized workers are not left behind.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Ethical Considerations\n\nThe development and implementation of AI must be guided by ethical considerations to ensure that it benefits humanity.

But there is no \"big replacement\"\u2014only incremental changes in the way we work, and that\u2019s okay! AI is only as powerful as the subject matter expertise of the people behind it, which creates a bit of a contradiction.\n\nOn one hand, AI amplifies expert human knowledge, meaning humans will need to become more competitive to stay ahead. On the other hand, current AI can\u2019t truly think like humans, so while it excels at complex tasks, it can also fail at a very basic level, often unexpectedly.\n\nPersonally, I want to see AI succeed in taking over repetitive workloads, allowing humans to focus on their unique strengths and the most creative aspects of our work. At the same time, we shouldn't overrely on AI for reasoning and critical thinking tasks\u2014you are only doing yourself and your clients a disservice.",

It has made our daily tasks efficient and contributed positively towards important sectors.\n\nBut at the same time, it is also raising concerns regarding privacy, job displacement and ethical dilemma. I believe that by adopting a human-centric approach where every human being and individual believes that there is and that Nothing can replace human touch and human feel which firms the cornerstone of creating connections while forming deeper and meaningful relationships\n\nHere's my take on this. I think the AI is here to assist and not to replace. With judicious, responsible and ethical use of this tool, we can make it as a useful servant but not a dangerous master.\n\nThe main idea of AI has always been to help the mankind in their tasks. However, it is not the AI that is going to replace jobs but it is the human's greed that is going to make lose jobs.\n\nWhile some employers ask \"Why should I hire you when AI does the same job?\" On the contrary, why should a client choose your company while AI can still solve the same problem more efficiently that you do?\" As an interviewer, ask the right questions in your interviews.\n\nUpskilling is definitely considered a boon in any industry but AI shouldn't be a bane to humankind. The moment we start comparing a machine to a human, it is so weird to see such an employer who doesn't have the basic idea that a human brain and a brainless machine can never match.\n\nRemember, AI doesn't have feelings and emotions to remove jobs of humans it is the greed of humankind that's killing jobs.",

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining a review of existing literature (primarily ISI-indexed journal articles) with a qualitative analysis of industry reports and expert interviews.  Key findings indicate that while AI-driven automation will lead to displacement in certain job categories, particularly those involving routine tasks, it will also simultaneously create new job roles in areas such as AI development, maintenance, and data analysis.  The net effect on employment is complex and dynamic, varying across different sectors and skill levels. The study concludes that proactive measures, including investment in education and reskilling initiatives, are crucial to mitigate the negative impacts of AI and harness its potential for economic growth and improved quality of life.\n\n\nKeywords: artificial intelligence, job displacement, job creation, automation, future of work\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various aspects of society, with one of the most significant impacts being on the labor market. The increasing capabilities of AI systems, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, are enabling automation of tasks previously performed by humans. This raises concerns about widespread job displacement and the potential for increased unemployment.\nHistorically, technological advancements have often led to shifts in the job market, with some jobs becoming obsolete while new ones emerge. The current wave of AI-driven automation is arguably different in its scale and scope, potentially affecting a wider range of occupations than previous technological revolutions.\nThere's a significant debate about the net effect of AI on employment. Some argue that AI will lead to mass unemployment, while others predict that it will create more jobs than it destroys. This uncertainty constitutes a critical research gap, requiring a nuanced understanding of both the displacement and creation effects of AI.\nThe purpose of this research is to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of AI on job displacement and creation, clarifying the complex dynamics at play. The research question is: How does the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence impact levels of employment overall, as well as the creation of new job opportunities?\nThe primary hypothesis is while AI will lead to significant job displacement in specific sectors and roles, particularly those involving repetitive and routine tasks, it will also concurrently generate new job opportunities, necessitating adaptation and reskilling",

Today, no one mourns the loss of manual toll collection. Instead, we celebrate faster commutes, reduced traffic, and more efficient highway systems. The fear of job displacement due to automation is nothing new - but history shows us a different story.\n\nThe reality is that AI, like any transformative technology, doesn't simply eliminate jobs - it transforms them. Take our customer's AP department as an example. Rather than replacing their AP clerk, AI automation enabled that single employee to process an astounding $2B in annual spend. The clerk's role evolved from manual data entry to managing exceptions, analyzing patterns, and making strategic decisions.\n\nJust as E-ZPass didn't end transportation jobs but shifted them to more valuable areas, AI in finance isn't about replacement - it's about enhancement. It frees humans from mundane, repetitive tasks and allows them to focus on work that truly requires human judgment, creativity, and relationship building.\n\nThe next time someone says \"I'll never let AI touch our financials,\" remind them that their morning commute is smoother because they embraced automation at the toll booth. The future of finance isn't about fewer jobs - it's about better ones.",

Cool, right?\n\nJust because someone hands you a high-powered rifle doesn't make you a skilled hunter. Similarly, giving someone AI coding tools doesn't create a competent developer.\n\nProgramming started with people plugging wires and flipping switches, then moved to writing basic instructions in computer language, and now we have user-friendly programming tools and AI assistants. Each new technology didn't make programmers disappear; it just transformed how they worked.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Systematic Thinking vs Code Typing\nProgramming was never about mindlessly writing lines of code. It's about solving complex problems, understanding intricate business processes, and creating elegant solutions. AI might generate code, but it can't replace strategic thinking.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Productivity, Not Replacement\nAI could make developers ten times more productive. But here's the kicker\u2014this won't shrink opportunities. It will exponentially expand the potential applications of programming across industries.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3\u26a0\ufe0fThe Dunning-Kruger Moment\nMany \"tech-bros\" and \"C-level bros\" are pontificating about AI replacing people.

Personally, I\u2019m prepping for a future where at least half of today\u2019s manual tasks, across all seniority levels, will be displaced in the next couple of years. Think about it: manual assessments, periodic reports, sampled audits, reviews, approvals, repetitive transactions, reconciliations, data collection, log analysis, contract reviews, due diligence, and legal research.\n\nThese tasks are on their way out, not because of some grand strategic plan but because of rollouts in ERPs, CRMs, and GRC software with AI features and agents. They allow:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Automation of routine document processing and analysis.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 The shift from human monitoring to AI-powered continuous oversight.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Predictive capabilities that outperform traditional methods.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Integration of specialized knowledge into accessible AI systems.\n\nWhat I do see is a growing demand for building predictive models, monitoring data drift, validating algorithm metrics, and deploying AI agents. This shift will require highly specialized professionals with AI coding skills and deep subject matter expertise.\n\nScientific research shows that ongoing AI innovations will lead to more sophisticated management tools, but ethical and regulatory challenges remain. AI technologies are automating routine tasks in sectors like manufacturing, retail, and customer service. The impact on the job market is still being studied, but one thing\u2019s clear: knowledge workers need to adapt and fast. The displacement effect is more pronounced in economically developed regions, but it also reduces regional job opportunity disparities by affecting high-wage positions.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 I\u2019m stoked to dive deeper into how AI reshapes risk and compliance. If you\u2019d like to explore how predictive models and AI tools can future-proof your career or scale your impact, let\u2019s sync up. Drop a comment or DM me. How do you see AI reshaping your field?\n\nVideo: Which side are you on? by R Robinson\nGenAI job disruption",

The list of \"Uncomfortable Truths\" for employers highlights what truly matters\u2014trust, leadership, fair pay, and a strong workplace culture. No AI system can replace the value of engaged, motivated, and happy employees.\n\nPeople don\u2019t quit jobs\u2014they quit bad managers. AI can streamline processes, but it cannot replace emotional intelligence, mentorship, or authentic leadership. Employees need clear communication, a culture of respect, and fair compensation\u2014not just automation to \"increase productivity.\" When companies undervalue these human elements, they risk losing their best talent to those who recognize their worth.\n\nToxic behavior, lack of trust, and poor leadership cannot be solved by AI-driven analytics alone. While technology can identify patterns, only human leaders can inspire, create belonging, and build trust. Happy employees are the foundation of happy customers\u2014because, as the image says, \"robots don\u2019t smile.\" Genuine connection, empathy, and teamwork will always be a company\u2019s greatest assets.\n\nSo, as organizations integrate AI into their operations, they must remember: technology should support people, not replace them.

Series A software companies have reduced their teams from an average of 22 employees in 2022 to just 15 in 2024...and as the Carta data shows, across most early stages in venture, team sizes have declined pretty strongly since 2022.\n\nWhile economic factors like the funding crunch & increased focus on capital efficiency certainly explain part of this trend, the AI factor cannot be ignored. When founders explicitly state they're delaying hires because their current team + AI tools can handle more work than expected, we're seeing a real-time demonstration of how AI will impact employment patterns.\n\nThis aligns with what economists call \"technological unemployment\" - but with an important nuance. In previous technological revolutions, automation typically displaced lower-skilled jobs first. AI's impact appears to be affecting knowledge workers at the outset, changing the sequence we've historically observed.\n\nThere's also evidence that AI tools are creating new categories of jobs and enhancing productivity in ways that could ultimately expand employment in different areas. The \"AI productivity paradox\" might be that while individual companies need fewer employees, the broader ecosystem could generate more total jobs through new ventures, enhanced capabilities, and novel business models.\n\nWhat's your perspective? Are you seeing AI primarily as a job displacement force or as a productivity multiplier that might ultimately create more opportunity?",

Contrary to popular fears of mass job losses, the findings highlight a more nuanced reality:\n\n- AI is transforming jobs, not just replacing them. Many professions will see increased efficiency and demand, rather than outright displacement.\n- Tech roles are growing: Software developers (+17.9%) and data specialists benefit from automation rather than being replaced by it. A surprise for many!\n- Routine jobs are declining: AI is taking over repetitive administrative tasks, leading to a reduction in support roles.\n- Expertise still matters: Financial advisors, engineers, and regulated professions remain in demand \u2013 where human judgment is critical, AI enhances rather than replaces.\n- AI adoption is slower than expected: Regulatory barriers, integration complexity, and societal acceptance slow down the impact\n\nKey takeaway from this report: AI is a powerful tool, but not an instant disruptor. The real transformation happens where technology meets human expertise.\n\nBased on my personal experience running some AI projects:\nShort term gains are inflated, especially by software sales trying to sell products and expertise. \"Turn-key-solutions\" are the most impactful tools right now with high probability of successful implementation and fast break-evens (for example in cyber-security). Customized projects scale very slow and external expertise for successful implementation is hard to find - if any.\n\nSo bottom-line: the short term impact is overrated, the long term transformation still underrated - at least based on my personal experience and this data..\n\nAgree?",

They reason, adapt, and make real-time decisions, whether it\u2019s handling insurance claims, conducting tax audits, or even generating investment insights.\n\nWith 82% of organisations planning to integrate AI agents within three years, we\u2019re looking at a paradigm shift: a digital workforce that augments, accelerates, and, in some roles, displaces human labour.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether AI agents will redefine work, it\u2019s how we prepare for it.\n\u2753Are businesses equipping their teams with AI literacy?\n\u2753Are we rethinking job design to integrate AI agents effectively?\n\u2753Are leaders ready to manage AI-augmented teams?\n\nThis is the time to proactively shape the AI-powered workplace, not just react to it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take: where do you see AI agents making the biggest impact? \ud83d\ude80",

So where\u2019s the sweet spot?\n\nAutomation is great when it takes care of repetitive, time-consuming tasks. If something doesn\u2019t require human judgment, automate it\u2014 simple as that. It frees up your team to focus on work that actually moves the business forward.\n\nBut I\u2019ve seen companies go overboard, trying to automate things that need human intuition \u2014 decision-making, creativity, customer relationships. A chatbot can answer questions, but it won\u2019t build trust. AI can generate insights, but it won\u2019t replace real-world experience.\n\nSo before you automate, ask yourself: Are you improving efficiency, or are you losing the human element that sets your business apart? The goal isn\u2019t just automation \u2014 it\u2019s smart automation.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? Where have you seen automation work well, and where has it missed the mark?",

Payroll specialists will need to upskill, focusing on compliance consulting, system implementation, and strategic payroll advisory rather than just processing pay runs.\n\nAI is not here to replace payroll jobs. It\u2019s here to redefine them. The ones that benefit will be those who can adapt.",

Instead, this is AI helping SMEs punch above their weight \u2014 predicting staffing needs, streamlining hiring processes, and helping small businesses build smarter, more resilient teams.\n\nWhat is AI-Driven Workforce Planning?\n\nFor SMEs, workforce planning has traditionally been a bit of a guessing game \u2014 with limited HR resources and unpredictable hiring needs. AI is flipping the script by:\n\u2022   Predicting future hiring needs using real-time data.\n\u2022   Automating job descriptions, candidate screening, and initial interviews.\n\u2022   Highlighting skill gaps and proactively recommending training or hiring solutions.\n\u2022   Tracking trends in employee turnover to help retain top talent.\n\nReal-World Example\n\nPlatforms like Employment Hero are already offering SMEs predictive hiring tools that analyse turnover rates, growth trends, and industry benchmarks. This levels the playing field, giving small businesses the same data-driven edge that larger enterprises have enjoyed for years.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nFor SMEs, workforce is everything. Having the right people at the right time can make or break a business. AI-driven workforce planning allows SMEs to:\n\u2022   Make smarter, faster hiring decisions.\n\u2022   Improve retention by spotting flight risks before they happen.\n\u2022   Align hiring with business goals \u2014 instead of reacting to crises.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAI isn\u2019t just automating work \u2014 it\u2019s helping SMEs be more strategic about their people. In a business world where agility is everything, this is the kind of AI innovation SMEs can\u2019t afford to ignore.\n\nIs your business using AI to plan for its future workforce?\nHow are you balancing automation with the human touch in your hiring process?\n\nLet\u2019s discuss \u2014 drop your thoughts below.",

But what if we\u2019re getting it wrong?\n\nNobel laureate Daron Acemoglu just dropped a game-changing paper on AI\u2019s real economic impact. His research makes it clear: AI won\u2019t automatically create prosperity\u2014it depends on how we use it.\n\nHere are five stats that should make every leader pay attention:\n\n\u26a1 50% of productivity gains from AI could end up concentrated in just a handful of companies.\n\u26a1 Only 0.4% of businesses in the US have adopted AI in a meaningful way\u2014so the gap is growing.\n\u26a1 Wages could drop by up to 10% in industries that replace workers with AI, rather than augment them.\n\u26a1 Less than 10% of AI R&D is focused on human augmentation\u2014most is geared towards automation.\n\u26a1 Inequality could spike if AI adoption follows the same pattern as past tech revolutions.\n\nThe takeaway? AI\u2019s economic impact isn\u2019t written in stone\u2014it\u2019s shaped by decisions we make today.\n\nIf we treat AI as a workforce multiplier instead of a cost-cutting machine, we\u2019ll see stronger businesses, better wages, and a more resilient economy.\n\nSo how do we steer AI in the right direction? Governments, business leaders, and AI developers need to collaborate on policies, incentives, and strategies that drive broad-based value\u2014not just efficiency gains.\n\nWould love to hear your take\u2014how is AI changing your industry?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Read the full paper here:",

Father of Robotics.\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nPrevious Poll (258/300)\nFACT: What\u2019s your biggest concern about AI-robots replacing human jobs?\nCORRECT ANSWER:\nWORLD VIEW:\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nThe biggest concern about AI-robots replacing human jobs is not just unemployment but the loss of purpose and economic imbalance. If machines take over most tasks, what happens to the millions whose skills become obsolete?\n\nWithout proactive policies - like reskilling programs, universal basic income, or new job creation - AI could widen the gap between the tech elite and the rest of society, leading to deep social and economic disruptions.\n\nSo the next question is - Aren't robots suppose to make human lives easier & better? Weren't they ideally built to assist humans, to reduce their workload? Is going through up-skilling and re-education every few years, easy and comfortable for humans? Is that the only way out?\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nMost groups of people think that the world is more frightening, more violent, and more hopeless, in short - more dramatic, than it really is. Be it in medical-law-engineering-management-arts, students, teachers, university lecturers, researchers, eminent scientists, investment bankers, executives in multi-national companies, journalists, activists or even the senior political decision makers of the countries and the world. Some are highly educated people who take interest in the world and sometimes, perhaps, in its growth (along with their own growth).\n\nIt is not the question of intelligence. But most of them, a stunning majority, seems to get the world devastatingly wrong, or rather \"systematically wrong\". When we hear or think a lot about something, it grows in our heads and we think the problem is bigger than it actually is. Let's look at the world as it is, shall we? It will unconsciously help us make better decisions in all walks of our lives.\n\n\ud83d\udcac I'll try to elaborate on how this fact can advance\n,\n, or\n.

It is fundamentally reshaping the future of HR by automating tasks, enhancing decision-making, and redefining how we develop and engage talent. The big question is no longer if we should embrace AI, but how we can harness its potential to elevate the HR function.\n\nAs HR leaders, we have already built strong partnerships with CFOs. Now, a new frontier awaits; collaborating with our CTOs to drive AI innovation and reimagine the workforce. But with AI automating many operational tasks, are we truly ready to step up as \"visionary job architects\"?\n\nIn my latest (March 2025) Strategic HR Leadership article series, I explore:\n\ud83d\udccc What AI and Generative AI really mean for HR\n\ud83d\udccc The evolving relationship between the CPO and CTO in the AI era\n\ud83d\udccc How AI can take over repetitive HR tasks and unlock strategic value\n\ud83d\udccc The emerging role of HR in designing future jobs and upskilling talent\n\nAI is not here to replace us. It is here to elevate us. The question is, \"are we ready to evolve\"? Let\u2019s start the conversation.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Book Idea: Tursunbayeva, A.

They\u2019re rethinking the need for human workers entirely.\n\nSo what can you do?\n\n\u2705 Develop a high-value, human-first skill set (AI can't replace creativity, leadership, and strategic thinking)\n\u2705 Build something of your own (A side business, personal brand, or specialized expertise = real career security).\n\u2705 Master AI collaboration (The best professionals don\u2019t compete with AI\u2014they make it work for them)\n\nThe question is NOT \u201cHow do I get hired?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cHow do I create so much unique value that employment is optional?\u201d",

You know what happens next: despite it not being the perfect match on paper, we send it along, and guess what?

It\u2019s about understanding *people*\u2014the story behind each CV, the potential that lies beyond keywords, and sometimes even the risk of taking a chance. It\u2019s about empathy, perspective, and putting yourself in the candidate's shoes.\n\nAI is an amazing tool that helps streamline processes, reduce bias, and uncover hidden patterns\u2014but when it comes to evaluating the person behind the resume, nothing beats a recruiter\u2019s intuition and heart.",

        "text": "**The AI Hiring Paradox: Why Finding AI Talent is Harder Than Ever** \n\nAI is transforming HR, streamlining processes, and making talent acquisition more data-driven. But ironically, AI itself has created a new set of challenges\u2014especially when it comes to hiring AI professionals.\n\nAt, we've seen firsthand how traditional HR and ATS systems struggle with AI talent acquisition. Here are some key challenges:\n\n**Mismatch Between Job Descriptions & AI Skill Sets** \u2013 Many job postings use outdated or vague terminology that doesn\u2019t align with real-world AI expertise, leading to misalignment between recruiters and candidates.\n\n**The Resume vs. Real Skills Dilemma** \u2013 AI professionals often have unconventional career paths, open-source contributions, or self-taught expertise that ATS systems fail to recognize. Filtering talent based on keywords alone can eliminate top-tier candidates.\n\n**Demand vs. Supply Gap** \u2013 The explosive demand for 'real' AI experts far exceeds the supply, making competition fierce. Attracting and retaining AI talent requires a different approach\u2014one that prioritizes company culture, innovation, and long-term growth over traditional hiring incentives.\n\n**Evaluating AI Talent Beyond the Buzzwords** \u2013 Many candidates list AI/ML skills, but assessing actual hands-on experience with frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or LLM fine-tuning requires a deeper technical screening process.\n\n**AI-Generated Resumes Are Flooding the Market** \u2013 Many candidates use AI tools to craft resumes that perfectly match job descriptions, making them look highly qualified on paper\u2014even when their actual expertise is limited.\n\n**Hiring Managers Are Wasting Valuable Time** \u2013 With more AI-optimized applications, hiring teams spend hours screening resumes, only to discover that many candidates lack real-world experience with AI technologies.\n\nSo, how do we solve these challenges? At, we leverage **AI-driven talent assessment** to bridge this gap\u2014ensuring companies find AI professionals who don\u2019t just look good on paper but can actually drive innovation.",

At The Straits Times Education Forum 2025, leaders repeated the same tired script: \u201cWe need the best talent\u201d, \u201cEducation is key\u201d, \u201cSingapore must stay competitive\u201d. Meanwhile, AI is reshaping jobs faster than our policies can keep up.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Here\u2019s the real problem:\n\nAI is replacing jobs faster than we\u2019re reskilling workers. While other countries are pushing AI-driven upskilling, Singapore still prioritizes degrees over real-world skills. By the time graduates enter the workforce, their knowledge is already outdated.\n\nWe are obsessed with foreign talent while ignoring AI\u2019s impact on local jobs. Companies hire globally but are slow to retrain Singaporeans for AI-driven roles. What happens when AI automates white-collar jobs before we reskill our workforce?\n\nAI doesn\u2019t care about prestige degrees. It cares about adaptability. Yet, we still push a degree-first mentality while AI-driven industries value skills, experience, and innovation. Are we training workers for jobs that won\u2019t exist?\n\nWe are NOT building AI thought leadership. The West and China lead AI research, while Singapore remains a consumer. Where\u2019s the real investment in AI-powered education, R&D, and startups? Without this, we\u2019ll just be users, not leaders.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Here\u2019s what needs to happen NOW:\n\ud83d\udd39 Shift from degrees to AI-powered skills training - lifelong learning, not one-time education.\n\ud83d\udd39 Prioritize local workforce AI upskilling before foreign talent.\n\ud83d\udd39 Invest in AI-driven industries - Singapore must lead, not follow.\n\nAI will disrupt Singapore\u2019s workforce.

        "text": "\"Humans VS. AI\" vs. \"Humans AND AI\"\n\nI will add that I think there are two slightly under-appreciated undercurrents in this discussion:\n- The class dimension: highly-educated white-collar specialists consider it absolutely natural that lower-skilled jobs get automated away and have no problem with that; but have a major problem \u2013 financial and existential \u2013 when automation comes for *their* jobs;\n- The job market situation we are facing as we speak: it\u2019s a \u201csilent bloodbath\u201d out there, particularly for the higher-paid knowledge workers. Whether it\u2019s worse than what we had in 2008 or not is up for debate. However, this crisis is little spoken of, because it is missing a clear and dislikeable culprit that in 2008 were the banks. The current crisis is caused by overall economic situation, which cannot be attributed to any particular political option or government \u2013 so *all* consecutive governments choose to pretend it\u2019s not happening (and do a very good job of it). Pls see this recent article from the Guardian if you need a reference:.\n\nBut that's just a side-note. I hope you check out the article for a more comprehensive discussion; and if you want to be a part of the future instead of reading about it pls drop me a line for a demo:.\n\n\nPS. And don't even get me started on replacing *consultants* with AI. I may not have written anything, but I think many of you can figure out my stance on this one \ud83d\ude0f .",

While AI excels at automating tasks and processing data, it lacks essential human qualities like creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical reasoning. Here's why AI cannot replace humans:\n\n- **Human Intuition and Creativity**: AI can analyze data patterns but falls short in innovative thinking and generating original ideas, which are uniquely human traits.\n- **Dependence on Human Input**: AI learns from human-provided data and lacks independent reasoning or self-awareness beyond its programming.\n- **Limited Contextual Understanding**: AI struggles with common sense, ethical dilemmas, and real-world nuances that shape human decision-making.\n- **Collaboration Over Replacement**: AI is meant to assist and enhance human capabilities, not replace them, as seen in fields like healthcare where it aids but does not replace the expertise of professionals.\n- **Job Evolution, Not Elimination**: AI automates tasks while creating new opportunities, emphasizing the need for humans to focus on roles requiring human skills like empathy and strategic thinking.\n\nIn conclusion, AI and humans are better together. AI should be used responsibly to enhance human potential through collaboration, ensuring technology serves society rather than supplanting it.",

It has made our daily tasks efficient and contributed positively towards important sectors.\n\nBut at the same time, it is also raising concerns regarding privacy, job displacement and ethical dilemma. I believe that by adopting a human-centric approach where every human being and individual believes that there is and that Nothing can replace human touch and human feel which firms the cornerstone of creating connections while forming deeper and meaningful relationships\n\nHere's my take on this. I think the AI is here to assist and not to replace. With judicious, responsible and ethical use of this tool, we can make it as a useful servant but not a dangerous master.\n\nThe main idea of AI has always been to help the mankind in their tasks. However, it is not the AI that is going to replace jobs but it is the human's greed that is going to make lose jobs.\n\nWhile some employers ask \"Why should I hire you when AI does the same job?\" On the contrary, why should a client choose your company while AI can still solve the same problem more efficiently that you do?\" As an interviewer, ask the right questions in your interviews.\n\nUpskilling is definitely considered a boon in any industry but AI shouldn't be a bane to humankind. The moment we start comparing a machine to a human, it is so weird to see such an employer who doesn't have the basic idea that a human brain and a brainless machine can never match.\n\nRemember, AI doesn't have feelings and emotions to remove jobs of humans it is the greed of humankind that's killing jobs.",

AI can do almost everything now.\u201d\n\nI was smiling to myself and turn around telling them it's a real man inside. \ud83d\ude02\n\nWith AI becoming more advanced, it was easy to mistake reality for automation. Deepfake videos, AI-generated voices, and even humanoid robots blurred the lines every day. Could people still tell the difference in the future?\nI am wondering \u2014what kind of world would my children grow up in? One where the real and artificial were indistinguishable?\n\nHow advanced can the AI go and what skill sets do you think we human need in future? No matter how advanced the AI is, I still believed technologies is here to complement us and assist human for better efficiency and productivity and not here to replace us.",

Instead, we got IT careers, digital banking, and that one family member who suddenly became a \u201ctech guru.\u201d\n\nNow, AI is here, and the same fear is back: Will AI replace us?\n\nLet\u2019s set the record straight\u2014AI is not a job-stealer; it\u2019s a productivity booster. Just like ATMs didn\u2019t replace bankers (but made their work easier) and spreadsheets didn\u2019t eliminate accountants (but saved them from manual calculations), AI is here to enhance our capabilities, not erase them.\n\nFor example in Fintech and beyond, AI is already:\n\u2705 Detecting fraud faster than ever\n\u2705 Automating repetitive tasks\n\u2705 Personalizing financial services\n\u2705 Helping businesses scale efficiently\n\nBut does that mean humans are out of the picture? Nope. The problems we solve today are more complex than ever. AI won\u2019t take your job, but someone who knows how to use AI might.\n\nSo, instead of fearing AI, embrace it, learn it, and leverage it. The future belongs to those who evolve with technology\u2014not those who resist it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, in a few years, every WhatsApp family group will have an uncle saying, \"Beta, AI se paisa kaise banate hain?\"",

        "text": "How is AI Actually Being Used in the Economy? \n\nNew research sheds light on the real-world impact of AI on jobs and industries.\n\nA team of researchers from Anthropic led byandanalyzed 4 million conversations from Claude to understand which economic tasks AI is already performing. Their study, \u201cWhich Economic Tasks are Performed with AI? Evidence from Millions of Claude Conversations,\u201d maps AI usage patterns across different occupations using data from the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s O*NET Database.\n\nHere are five key takeaways that reveal how AI is reshaping work today:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 AI\u2019s Growing Economic Role - AI is widely used across industries, but software development and writing tasks dominate, accounting for nearly half of all usage. These fields are seeing the fastest integration of AI-driven workflows.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Deep AI Integration in Select Fields - AI is not evenly distributed across occupations. 4% of jobs use AI for 75%+ of their tasks, while 36% use AI for at least 25%. Adoption is highest in roles requiring critical thinking and writing, such as data science, software engineering, and technical writing\u2014but remains minimal in jobs involving physical labor.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Who\u2019s Using AI? - AI adoption is concentrated in mid-to-high wage jobs, particularly in software-related roles. Interestingly, low-wage jobs (e.g., restaurant workers) and high-wage jobs (e.g., physicians) show relatively low AI adoption, likely due to a mix of regulatory barriers and the nature of these tasks.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 AI as a Tool vs. a Replacement - AI is being used in two primary ways: 57% of interactions show augmentation - AI helps humans iterate and improve their work (e.g., writing, coding, brainstorming), while 43% of interactions are automation-driven - AI completes tasks with minimal human input (e.g., generating reports, summarizing documents). AI is both a collaborator and an efficiency booster, depending on the task.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 A New Framework for Measuring AI\u2019s Impact \u2013 The study introduces an empirical, data-driven method for tracking AI\u2019s evolving role in the economy. As AI capabilities advance, this approach could provide early indicators of where automation and augmentation are heading, helping business leaders, policymakers, and researchers stay ahead of the curve.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e The Big Question: How will AI continue to reshape industries? Are we seeing early signs of AI-native jobs and workflows?\n\nCurious to hear from professionals across different sectors - how are you using AI in your work today? \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udcac",

It is fundamentally reshaping the future of HR by automating tasks, enhancing decision-making, and redefining how we develop and engage talent. The big question is no longer if we should embrace AI, but how we can harness its potential to elevate the HR function.\n\nAs HR leaders, we have already built strong partnerships with CFOs. Now, a new frontier awaits; collaborating with our CTOs to drive AI innovation and reimagine the workforce. But with AI automating many operational tasks, are we truly ready to step up as \"visionary job architects\"?\n\nIn my latest (March 2025) Strategic HR Leadership article series, I explore:\n\ud83d\udccc What AI and Generative AI really mean for HR\n\ud83d\udccc The evolving relationship between the CPO and CTO in the AI era\n\ud83d\udccc How AI can take over repetitive HR tasks and unlock strategic value\n\ud83d\udccc The emerging role of HR in designing future jobs and upskilling talent\n\nAI is not here to replace us. It is here to elevate us. The question is, \"are we ready to evolve\"? Let\u2019s start the conversation.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Book Idea: Tursunbayeva, A.

While AI excels at automating tasks and processing data, it lacks essential human qualities like creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical reasoning.

AI should be used responsibly to enhance human potential through collaboration, ensuring technology serves society rather than supplanting it.",

It has made our daily tasks efficient and contributed positively towards important sectors.\n\nBut at the same time, it is also raising concerns regarding privacy, job displacement and ethical dilemma. I believe that by adopting a human-centric approach where every human being and individual believes that there is and that Nothing can replace human touch and human feel which firms the cornerstone of creating connections while forming deeper and meaningful relationships\n\nHere's my take on this. I think the AI is here to assist and not to replace. With judicious, responsible and ethical use of this tool, we can make it as a useful servant but not a dangerous master.\n\nThe main idea of AI has always been to help the mankind in their tasks. However, it is not the AI that is going to replace jobs but it is the human's greed that is going to make lose jobs.\n\nWhile some employers ask \"Why should I hire you when AI does the same job?\" On the contrary, why should a client choose your company while AI can still solve the same problem more efficiently that you do?\" As an interviewer, ask the right questions in your interviews.\n\nUpskilling is definitely considered a boon in any industry but AI shouldn't be a bane to humankind. The moment we start comparing a machine to a human, it is so weird to see such an employer who doesn't have the basic idea that a human brain and a brainless machine can never match.\n\nRemember, AI doesn't have feelings and emotions to remove jobs of humans it is the greed of humankind that's killing jobs.",

The real competitive advantage lies in how organizations reimagine workflows to integrate AI and human capabilities, fostering innovation, efficiency, and new value creation.\n\nSuccess in the AI era isn\u2019t about automation alone\u2014it\u2019s about collaboration between human intuition and machine intelligence. We need to eliminate this binary thinking of human or machine - it's about finding success in the middle\n\nHow is your industry adapting to this shift?",

AI, automation, and robotics are coalescing into what can only be described as Synthetic Workers: entities that produce value through their independent operation rather than through human manipulation. This shift demands we reimagine not just technology's role in society, but our entire conception of work, value creation, and economic organization.",

In this current era of business process transformation, AI systems are not replacing us wholesale; rather, they are amplifying our skills and collaborating with us to achieve productivity gains that have previously been impossible.\u201d\n\nRather than replacing jobs, AI is changing them. The real power of AI lies in complementing and augmenting human capabilities.\n\n\u201cBut what we\u2019ve found in our research is that although AI can be deployed to automate certain tasks, the technology\u2019s greater power is in complementing and augmenting human capabilities.\u201d\n\nAtwe see this transformation firsthand.

Instead, we got IT careers, digital banking, and that one family member who suddenly became a \u201ctech guru.\u201d\n\nNow, AI is here, and the same fear is back: Will AI replace us?\n\nLet\u2019s set the record straight\u2014AI is not a job-stealer; it\u2019s a productivity booster. Just like ATMs didn\u2019t replace bankers (but made their work easier) and spreadsheets didn\u2019t eliminate accountants (but saved them from manual calculations), AI is here to enhance our capabilities, not erase them.\n\nFor example in Fintech and beyond, AI is already:\n\u2705 Detecting fraud faster than ever\n\u2705 Automating repetitive tasks\n\u2705 Personalizing financial services\n\u2705 Helping businesses scale efficiently\n\nBut does that mean humans are out of the picture? Nope. The problems we solve today are more complex than ever. AI won\u2019t take your job, but someone who knows how to use AI might.\n\nSo, instead of fearing AI, embrace it, learn it, and leverage it. The future belongs to those who evolve with technology\u2014not those who resist it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, in a few years, every WhatsApp family group will have an uncle saying, \"Beta, AI se paisa kaise banate hain?\"",

In the video below you\u2019ll see Manus AI creating a course on momentum theory:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f It researches momentum theory\n\u27a1\ufe0f Designed a curriculum\n\u27a1\ufe0f Built interactive lessons\n\u27a1\ufe0f Created presentations\n\u27a1\ufe0f Published it all to public URLs\n\nAll from one prompt.\n\nThis is agentic AI - AI that doesn\u2019t just assist but autonomously completes entire processes.\n\nTwo years ago, I was playing with OpenGPT, a program that promised similar output. But the quality and speed of Manus had completely changed the accuracy, accessibility, and versatility of agentic AI.\n\nAs one of the participants yesterday said\n\u201cThis has been a real eye opener\u201d \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nBecause what we NEED to be thinking about now is - how do we build workplaces where AI works for us, not against us?\n\nBecause AI doesn\u2019t have to replace human workers - but what it is doing, is exposing badly designed roles.\n\n\u2753If AI can handle the bulk of a job function, was that ever the best use of human potential?\n\u2753If AI is replacing key tasks, how do we redefine what work actually means inside our businesses?\n\u2753If 70% of what companies hire for today is automatable, what should leaders be hiring for instead?\n\nThis isn\u2019t something you can start thinking about in 6 months time, or next year.\nThis is happening right now.\n\nThe businesses that embrace this shift first - even imperfectly - will be the ones leading the future.\n\nThe businesses that delay?\nThat pretend AI isn\u2019t here or that it\u2019s just a phase?\nThey\u2019ll be left scrambling to retrofit their workforce later.\n\nAI isn\u2019t just a tool - it is literally redefining what it means to be human.

As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.\n\nIf the US faces a recession in 2025, it will \"Turbocharge\" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapore\u2019s economic growth to be between 1% and 3%\u2014a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.\n\nAt the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.\n\nLooking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globally\u2014but we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.\n\nThe key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?\n\nWhat do you think?",

Dead.\n\nSalespeople? ChatGPT,, and Lavender are closing deals, handling objections, and running entire outbound campaigns. SDRs and BDRs? Done.\n\nGraphic Designers? Midjourney, DALL\u00b7E, and Runway generate high-quality visuals, branding, and entire ad campaigns. Freelance design? Collapsing.\n\nCopywriters & Marketers?,, and\u2019sare generating sales emails, blog content, and SEO strategies better than humans. Content teams? Getting slashed.\n\nHR & Recruiting?,, and AI-driven screening tools are deciding who gets hired or fired. Recruiters? Becoming obsolete.\n\nCustomer Support? OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 Turbo and\u2019s Fin handle tickets, chats, and full customer journeys without humans. Why outsource support when AI is faster, cheaper, and better?\n\nFinancial Analysts? AI-powered trading bots and predictive analytics tools outperform human investors. Traditional finance jobs? Dying fast.\n\nSaaS?

Here are some major points:\n\n\u00b7       Currently, most changes in the broad category of artificial intelligence impacting your work, is focused on certain tasks within the job, and not the job itself.\n\u00b7       In 2022, less than 1% were asking for AI skills in job openings\n\u00b7       In 2023, only about 2% of job postings asked for AI skills\n\u00b7       By the end of 2024, more than 25% were asking for some skills or experiences in AI\n\u00b7       The projections are that by the end of 2025, up to 40% or 50% will be asking for some level of AI skills or experiences.\n\u00b7       The demand for AI skills is spreading to a broader set of occupations, industries, and local labor markets.\n\u00b7       The leading sectors using artificial intelligence seems to be in finance, healthcare, retail and manufacturing (which includes engineering, logistics and warehousing).\n\u00b7       Companies want to leverage new technologies to impact productivity and innovation.\n\u00b7       While most headlines are directed at professionals who can create, design and implement artificial intelligence, most employers today are looking for those who have the skills and experiences to use the technology, not build them.\n\u00b7       Hiring managers seek employees who are familiar with some of the basic AI tools and concepts, can effectively work alongside AI systems, and utilize this knowledge to enhance operational efficiency.\n\u00b7       There\u2019s a recognized skill gap between what organizations are going to need, versus the current skills of their employees.  Organizations are investing in training programs for current employees while recruiting new hires to fill in the gaps.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear trend that future employees must have a growing degree of knowledge about artificial intelligence, some skill in using it, and an interest in learning more.  If you don\u2019t have a curiosity about artificial intelligence, how it works, along with an ability to effectively use it, then you\u2019re well behind the curve.  In this competitive world, with a transformational event about to occur which will affect your future, it\u2019s best to be in front of the transition, not behind.\n\nConclusions:\n\u00b7       With the trends and demands for AI skills, the expectations for employees to have knowledge and experience in this area will only grow.\n\u00b7       If you\u2019re not getting proper new-skills training in technology, get it yourself with either self-taught programs on-line or local courses, then seek another job.  If your company doesn\u2019t prepare you for the future, find one who will.  You can\u2019t afford to fall behind.\n\u00b7       Internal employees who either keep up with the technology demands or develop the skills in advance, will progress in their careers faster than those who are playing catch-up.\n\nWant help with your resume or job search?

They'll be the companies mastering the hybrid approach.\"\n\nThe coding landscape is transforming faster than most realize.\n\nDario Amodei's March 2025 prediction that AI will dominate coding has sparked significant discussion across professional networks, with perspectives ranging from enthusiasm to concern.\n\nWhile the timeline may be ambitious, the direction appears increasingly clear.\n\nGitHub Copilot's adoption by 77,000 organizations in just two years and McKinsey's 2025 report indicating AI could automate up to 70% of coding tasks signal a fundamental shift that's already in progress.\n\nWhat will distinguish successful organizations in this transition is not how quickly they replace developers with AI, but how strategically they integrate both.\n\nThe companies making strides in this new era are enhancing their engineering teams by transforming them into AI-augmented units where specialized talent directs increasingly powerful tools.\n\nThe most successful organizations are building hybrid teams that combine:\n\u2022 AI specialists who understand how to prompt, guide, and quality-check AI-generated code\n\u2022 Strategic architects who design the systems AI helps build\n\u2022 Experienced developers who provide the contextual understanding and ethical oversight that models cannot replicate\n\nThis represents not the end of coding as we know it, but rather its evolution.\n\nOrganizations approaching this transition thoughtfully are gaining significant competitive advantages, while those pursuing complete AI automation may encounter challenges including security vulnerabilities, misaligned outputs, and strategic limitations.\n\nConversely, companies that resist AI adoption altogether risk falling behind as competitors leverage these tools to accelerate development cycles, reduce costs, and innovate more rapidly.\n\nThe worst position in today's market is not transitioning too quickly, but failing to transition at all.\n\nThe future of development lies not in humans versus AI, but in humans and AI collaborating to create possibilities neither could achieve independently.\n\nThe transformation is underway, and the right approach presents an opportunity rather than a threat.\n\nI may be wrong, but as your AI concierge, my job is to help you navigate this rapidly evolving landscape with clarity and balance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow me for a mix of 90s throwback vibes, cutting-edge AI insights, and entrepreneurial expertise to fuel your journey\u2014let\u2019s connect the past and future together!",

        "text": "I just finished speaking at a CTL global event on the Now and the Next in Hiring and JobSearch. AI was naturally a hot topic. With a Capterra survey showing 73% of Australian respondents to their survey had used it when applying for jobs it's shifting the playing field for hirers and candidates. So what could this mean in 2025 and beyond - here are two of my predictions and what they will mean to jobseekers.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 GenAI is creating a credibility conundrum across all phases of screening with jobseekers using it to assist with everything from resumes, applications and online interview answers through to formal testing.\n\nImplications: We could see a growing focus on proof at all stages. Screening will look for metrics, success stories, verified credentials / skills, and multiple sources of truth. Skills-based hiring and skills assessments might increase along with in-person tests and interviews, gamified simulations and robust referee checks.\n\nPrediction: Hoops before hired may mainstream. Jobseekers may need to go through more steps to get hired. These may include anything from initial AI phone screening and 1-way interviews to in-person interviews and AI-resistant skills-based assessment tools. Skills currency, proficiency and visibility will all be critical. Having the 'right' skills, that can be found and verified by hirers, may equal more opportunities.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Autoapply and GenAI tools are making it faster and easier to apply but harder to compete.\n\nImplications: In traditional online channels, application volumes may grow and candidates may need to do more to make the interview cut so application rejections could rise. So may job seeker frustration. This could test the resilience and ingenuity of job seekers. Hirers may get frustrated with generic application volumes and increasingly look to proactive approaches including sourcing tools and referrals to find talent.\n\nPrediction: Candidates with strong searchable personal brands and those who know how to use their networks will surge ahead. Powerful brands, warm referrals and introductions will be gold during the job search. AI job search tools will become even more normalised but people may start to recognise their limitations and see them as a tool, rather than a magic wand. The digital-divide may grow. On the upside AI use by hirers may mean jobseekers finally get the transparency they have been seeking with feedback on interviews, application progress and performance insights.\n\nAI is certainly shifting the job search landscape. Even with all my monitoring of this year's hiring trends, predictions are just guesses on what's ahead. The only certainty is AI isn't going anywhere and those who will succeed will be the ones who evolve.\n\nLooking forward to hearing more on topics like this in LinkedIn's\n.",

That's up from just 1% in 2024.\n\n\u21b3 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be made autonomously through agentic AI.\n\n\u21b3 AI agents will transform marketing and customer service\n\nJensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, has described the potential of AI agents emphasising their transformative role in the workplace.\n\n\u201cAIs will be in Slack channels with each other, and with humans. So we'll just be one large employee base if you will \u2014 some of them are digital and AI, and some of them are biological.\"\n\nHuang's vision for integrating AI agents as collaborative digital workers that amplify human capabilities rather than replace them entirely.\n\nThe best part? You don't need to worry about job replacement.\n\nInstead, here's what AI agents can do for you:\n\n\u2705 Handle 20-50% of repetitive tasks\n\u2705 Work 1000x faster than humans\n\u2705 Collaborate with other AI agents\n\u2705 Adapt to failures automatically\n\nThink about that for your business:\n\n\u21b3 Less time on repetitive tasks\n\u21b3 Faster decision-making\n\u21b3 Improved workflow automation\n\u21b3 Better customer service\n\nThe best part?\n\nYou don't need to be a tech giant to benefit.\n\nThis technology is becoming more accessible every day.\n\nP.S.

Here are my predictions for this year and what you need to do!\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 AI & Automation will redefine roles. AI isn\u2019t just a buzzword - its transforming industries. While some jobs will be automated, new roles will emerge in AI management, ethics & integration. Upskilling is not negotiable. If you have not learned AI, you are behind.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 RTO - Return to Office. More companies are requiring people to return to office FT. The other option that employers will offer is hybrid - 2-3 days in the office and the rest at home. Unfortunately, many people are used to working remotely. However, if you want a job, you may need to realign and be more flexible. If you only want remote, there are many job boards that focus on remote only!\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Job Market will remain flat & competitive. Job market will continue to be insanely competitive. Candidates will need to really have their UVP (Unique Value Proposition) to stand out in their niche and from other candidates. A strong candidate will also know how to tell a story about their experiences and what they bring to the table. We may also see more lay offs in the tech sector. Candidates should look at other industries their skills can transfer to.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 A rise in Side Gigs, contract or fractional work. With the job market competitive and approx 200-300 min applications, candidates will need to start thinking of other ways to make money. Digital Marketing has grown substantially in the last 4 years. Forbes has rated it a high growth industry. There are also multiple different types of job boards that are focused on contract and fractional work like Fiverr, Flexjobs, etc.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Green jobs will boom! With sustainability at the forefront, roles in renewable energy, ESG (Environment, social and governance) and green tech will skyrocket. If you are passionate about the planet, this is your moment!\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Life long learning is the new normal! Candidates must stay relevant and learn new skills. As you research other companies that you may be interested in, pay attention to the specific skills that are required. If there is a gap, learn the skill. You can do continuous learning through certifications, micro credentials and online courses. This will help you to stay relevant.\n\nWhat else would you add to this list? Would love to hear from you.\n\nI am rooting for you!\nCoach Kat",

These are AI software that can autonomously perform tasks to achieve specified goals.\n\nI expect this trend to accelerate in 2025. Why?\n\n- Tech giants are spending 10's of billions on AI.\n- Yet productivity gains, cost savings proved limited.\n- ROI of AI is now under intense scrutiny.\n\nAI agents represent a route to dramatically higher returns through automated end-to-end task completion.\n\n\ud835\udfee/ \ud835\udddd\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddef\ud835\ude00 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddef\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1\n\nAs the world continues pouring billions into AI development, from AI models to AI agents, the outcome is inevitable: some jobs will disappear.\n\nTraditional comparisons about the impact of technology don't take the unique characteristics of AI into consideration:\n\n- Primarily based on software, AI scales almost instantly.\n- Impact is broad and affects even highly skilled roles.\n\nEven if AI never gets any better as of today, I expect jobs to continue to disappear and others to change in the years ahead.

We're moving from 'model builders' to 'AI orchestrators' who can design systems that safely interact with real-world services.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 The talent war is heating up! Anthropic, Microsoft, and Google are all racing to launch similar tools. I'm tracking a 47% increase in job postings mentioning AI Agents since September.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Most intriguingly, Sam Altman called this \"the next giant breakthrough\" - not model improvements. That's a MASSIVE hint about where the industry is heading.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf My prediction? The companies that win won't be those with the smartest AI, but those with the safest, most reliable execution.\n\nThe real question: How will this reshape the AI talent landscape in 2025? \ud83e\udd14\n\nDrop your thoughts in the comments below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\n\nThanks for everything and see you at work! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nChris",

And i'm pleased to say i wasn't completely wrong. \n\nMy take away from 2024 is that AI foundational models are increasingly commodities - with all the major labs offering high quality models, which can solve a lot of problems and add real value. But while they can mimic a lot of teaching and education tasks, i don't think any can be left alone with a class yet.\n\nSo while big tech pushes towards genius level abilities on many tests, what i actually think is missing is good mid-career level replication of the jobs we do daily. And it's this product level work which is slow to appear.\n\nlots more in the link below - and don't worry, i'll do some more predictions for 2025..",

So, in a post that will surely face ridicule and likely be very wrong let me indulge in some predictions for 2025.\n\nI'm going to break this into two areas: 1. Technology & Recruitment/Labour Market predictions and 2. Anything else that has occupied my brain over the last few weeks.\n\nTech/Recruitment:\n1. Despite already low unemployment numbers, I expect to see a rise in job advertisements within technology for the rest of this FY. Hopefully we'll have less \"we'll wait and see\" from employers this year. Technology projects that have waited for better conditions should kick off this year.\n\n2. This is the year of AI consolidation. I expect a number of companies to continue investing in AI and expect to see demand here skyrocket, as well as more Head of AI or Chief AI Officer roles come to market.\n\n3. Australian VC & PE activity to rebound. 2024 was a quieter year for investment with the total number of deals down thanks to increased cost of capital amongst other issues. Expect more deals, but not necessarily larger ones.\n\n4. Medtech is in for a big year. Advancements in AI are allowing this critical industry to iterate and research faster than ever before. The work being done here is fascinating from BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) to advances in diagnostics & patient care the list is endless and exciting to watch.\n\n5. The multi faceted Tech Executive is in demand. The technologist is fast becoming the future CEO. Technology Executives are well placed to work with aspirational businesses who intend to use tech as their disruptor to the status quo. Seeing more CIO or CTO types in COO and CEO roles will become commonplace and is a great strategy for forward thinking boards dealing with evolving AI and Cyber landscapes.\n\nBonus thoughts:\n1. Australia may well have a hung parliament when we go to the polls in March.\n\n2. The Crypto bull run doesn't have an end in sight. How high will Bitcoin go?\n\n3. Donald Trump will have a tough first 12 month delivering on much of what was promised.\n\n4. Who's going to \"do a CrowdStrike\" in 2025?\n\nIf you've read this much, I apologise. I look forward to being comprehensively disproved on much of this. But I truly hope #1 comes to fruition, early signs are promising based on \"I'm hiring\" posts on LinkedIn.\n\nWhat have I missed and what are your predictions for the year ahead?",

Although some of this materialized, on the headcount prediction, we actually built larger teams with people to run and build software on these computers, including information sharing and the Internets of stuff.\n\nMy gut says in the immediate 10 year horizon, AI and Agents will follow a similar but different path. All the talk of white collar workers going away, needing less people, etc. etc. -- I'm not so sure. I think automation of blue collar manufacturing tasks will continue and some service jobs, e.g. Uber drivers, will be transformed, but all these bots, machines and software still need to be created, managed/operated, and maintained.\n\nOne thing is certain,\nwill be at the center of all this, and what AI has initially done is finally forced the \"fix the data\" discussion in enterprises. However, what people are also realizing is disjointed stacks to manage data need a rethink. If your data team grows to the point the headcount you are saving with agent automation are absorbed by babysitting and futzing with these stacks, then I think we have defeated the purpose of them.\n\nBut agents and ML are here to stay for now and they indeed do need clean data. The article below was written to help folks understand whywas built the way it was and how it can help your Agent development by starting with feeding clean data / datasets to your agents.\n\nWhenand I started the company, one of our medium-term goals was to improve the accuracy and speed at which ML projects can be developed. We now know ML mostly by it's AI umbrella name now, but the principals remain the same: clean, accessible and canonical data is key to their accuracy and adoption.",

        "text": "Most enterprises fixated on AI ROI will scale back prematurely.\n\nThis is a prediction from Forrester in their 2025 B2C Marketing and CX paper.\n\nImpatience from executives is cited as the driver from pulling back on AI initiatives with:\n\u27a1\ufe0f 49% expecting a return in 1 - 3 years\n\u27a1\ufe0f 44% expecting a return in 3 - 5 years\n\nWith all the hype that we see connected to AI it is no wonder we all have such high expectations of the technology.\n\nThe challenge is, if you pull back you could well be left behind in your industry.\n\nWhat can we do about this?\n\nIn the contact centre/ CX domain, I'll offer a few examples:\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Call Summarisation\nThis is all the rage and there is an expectation that it works straight away. It doesn't. You have to build out a dictionary of knowledge specific to your product/ service and the language that you use with your customers and/or internal stakeholders. This takes time and iteration. It certainly can be done and definitely has benefits.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Automated QA\nVery similar to call summarisation, the technology is working off a transcript. To get the technology to work for you, you do have to build out markers for what good looks like based on attributes that you are looking to validate in the performance of a call. For one of our accounts we have 3000 markers built out specific to that customer. It is great and it saves heaps of time! There is config involved though.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Bots\nBe it a voice bot or a chat bot, the concept is similar. At the core, you are building out automated workflows to handle customer enquiries at scale. Integration is critical to get the job done and increase your fixed-on-first rates. However, understanding customer demand/ intents, adjusting for them as your customers needs change, and turning the language are all critical. Again this takes time, but well worth the journey if you have the volume to support such an initiative.\n\n\ud83d\udcad As our world transforms with AI, the results won't happen overnight, but it is those that believe and persist that will achieve the productivity benefits that they are chasing and be ahead of the pack!",

It has made our daily tasks efficient and contributed positively towards important sectors.\n\nBut at the same time, it is also raising concerns regarding privacy, job displacement and ethical dilemma. I believe that by adopting a human-centric approach where every human being and individual believes that there is and that Nothing can replace human touch and human feel which firms the cornerstone of creating connections while forming deeper and meaningful relationships\n\nHere's my take on this. I think the AI is here to assist and not to replace. With judicious, responsible and ethical use of this tool, we can make it as a useful servant but not a dangerous master.\n\nThe main idea of AI has always been to help the mankind in their tasks. However, it is not the AI that is going to replace jobs but it is the human's greed that is going to make lose jobs.\n\nWhile some employers ask \"Why should I hire you when AI does the same job?\" On the contrary, why should a client choose your company while AI can still solve the same problem more efficiently that you do?\" As an interviewer, ask the right questions in your interviews.\n\nUpskilling is definitely considered a boon in any industry but AI shouldn't be a bane to humankind. The moment we start comparing a machine to a human, it is so weird to see such an employer who doesn't have the basic idea that a human brain and a brainless machine can never match.\n\nRemember, AI doesn't have feelings and emotions to remove jobs of humans it is the greed of humankind that's killing jobs.",

The people creating and researching Artificial and General Intelligence are the engineers themselves. The beta testers, if you will, are software engineers. It seems like the marketing strategy here is that if this can replace high skill workers like the engineers who create it , then it can replace the guy/ gal that makes your excel reports or the call center rep that collects bills or answers questions. In short: it\u2019s about building trust with other industries.\n\nMost industries have not been touched by AI yet, which is crazy to think about because those medium-low skill knowledge workers ARE the primary target.\n\nSo\u2026 Who\u2019s job will it be to automate and integrate Artificial Intelligence into the workflows of all those domains?\n\nHint: They like dark rooms and coffee.\n\u2615\ufe0f\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffe\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\n\nIt can replace some of us.

That process took decades. But AI is moving at an exponentially faster pace, and the first wave of displacement isn\u2019t hitting factory workers\u2014it\u2019s coming for software engineers, analysts, and writers.\n\nA new study from Anthropic (link in the comments) shows that AI usage is already deeply embedded in software development, content creation, and analytical work. Roughly 36% of occupations now use AI for at least a quarter of their tasks, with coding, debugging, and writing among the most automated areas. This isn\u2019t just a tool for acceleration\u2014it\u2019s replacing work outright. What\u2019s especially striking is that AI\u2019s impact is peaking in mid-to-high-wage jobs. Unlike factory automation, which gutted middle-class, blue-collar jobs, AI is starting with knowledge workers\u2014the people who thought they were safest.\n\nAt first, AI is an augmenter\u2014helping us work faster. Right now, 57% of usage is augmentation, meaning humans still direct the process. But the other 43% is full automation\u2014AI completing tasks with little to no human involvement. And if history is any guide, augmentation is just the beginning. In manufacturing, humans and machines coexisted for a while, but eventually, robots didn\u2019t just help\u2014they took over. AI is on track to follow the same pattern, but at warp speed.\n\nFor businesses and professionals, the implications are clear. If you\u2019re in a field where AI is starting to handle tasks you once owned, you need to move up the value chain\u2014fast. Specializing in AI oversight, system design, or high-stakes decision-making will be key. And for companies, this isn\u2019t just about efficiency\u2014it\u2019s a strategic shift. The firms that learn how to integrate AI while keeping human insight where it matters will define the next era of work. The ones that don\u2019t? They\u2019ll get automated too.\n\nWhat have you seen in your field? Does the Anthropic paper support your own observations, or not?",

While AI excels at automating tasks and processing data, it lacks essential human qualities like creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical reasoning.

Each new technology didn't make programmers disappear; it just transformed how they worked.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Systematic Thinking vs Code Typing\nProgramming was never about mindlessly writing lines of code. It's about solving complex problems, understanding intricate business processes, and creating elegant solutions. AI might generate code, but it can't replace strategic thinking.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Productivity, Not Replacement\nAI could make developers ten times more productive. But here's the kicker\u2014this won't shrink opportunities. It will exponentially expand the potential applications of programming across industries.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3\u26a0\ufe0fThe Dunning-Kruger Moment\nMany \"tech-bros\" and \"C-level bros\" are pontificating about AI replacing people. Spoiler alert: They either don't understand the nuance or are trying to sell you something.",

From AI designing skyscrapers in hours to automating tasks we once thought untouchable, the \"automation cliff\" is approaching fast. And it\u2019s not just blue-collar jobs at stake\u2014white-collar roles like legal, financial, and even medical professions are entering uncharted territory.\n\nBut here's the twist: this transformation doesn\u2019t have to spell doom.

Contrary to popular fears of mass job losses, the findings highlight a more nuanced reality:\n\n- AI is transforming jobs, not just replacing them. Many professions will see increased efficiency and demand, rather than outright displacement.\n- Tech roles are growing: Software developers (+17.9%) and data specialists benefit from automation rather than being replaced by it. A surprise for many!\n- Routine jobs are declining: AI is taking over repetitive administrative tasks, leading to a reduction in support roles.\n- Expertise still matters: Financial advisors, engineers, and regulated professions remain in demand \u2013 where human judgment is critical, AI enhances rather than replaces.\n- AI adoption is slower than expected: Regulatory barriers, integration complexity, and societal acceptance slow down the impact\n\nKey takeaway from this report: AI is a powerful tool, but not an instant disruptor. The real transformation happens where technology meets human expertise.\n\nBased on my personal experience running some AI projects:\nShort term gains are inflated, especially by software sales trying to sell products and expertise. \"Turn-key-solutions\" are the most impactful tools right now with high probability of successful implementation and fast break-evens (for example in cyber-security). Customized projects scale very slow and external expertise for successful implementation is hard to find - if any.\n\nSo bottom-line: the short term impact is overrated, the long term transformation still underrated - at least based on my personal experience and this data..\n\nAgree?",

Instead, we got IT careers, digital banking, and that one family member who suddenly became a \u201ctech guru.\u201d\n\nNow, AI is here, and the same fear is back: Will AI replace us?\n\nLet\u2019s set the record straight\u2014AI is not a job-stealer; it\u2019s a productivity booster. Just like ATMs didn\u2019t replace bankers (but made their work easier) and spreadsheets didn\u2019t eliminate accountants (but saved them from manual calculations), AI is here to enhance our capabilities, not erase them.\n\nFor example in Fintech and beyond, AI is already:\n\u2705 Detecting fraud faster than ever\n\u2705 Automating repetitive tasks\n\u2705 Personalizing financial services\n\u2705 Helping businesses scale efficiently\n\nBut does that mean humans are out of the picture? Nope. The problems we solve today are more complex than ever. AI won\u2019t take your job, but someone who knows how to use AI might.\n\nSo, instead of fearing AI, embrace it, learn it, and leverage it. The future belongs to those who evolve with technology\u2014not those who resist it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, in a few years, every WhatsApp family group will have an uncle saying, \"Beta, AI se paisa kaise banate hain?\"",

No AI system can replace the value of engaged, motivated, and happy employees.\n\nPeople don\u2019t quit jobs\u2014they quit bad managers. AI can streamline processes, but it cannot replace emotional intelligence, mentorship, or authentic leadership. Employees need clear communication, a culture of respect, and fair compensation\u2014not just automation to \"increase productivity.\" When companies undervalue these human elements, they risk losing their best talent to those who recognize their worth.\n\nToxic behavior, lack of trust, and poor leadership cannot be solved by AI-driven analytics alone. While technology can identify patterns, only human leaders can inspire, create belonging, and build trust. Happy employees are the foundation of happy customers\u2014because, as the image says, \"robots don\u2019t smile.\" Genuine connection, empathy, and teamwork will always be a company\u2019s greatest assets.\n\nSo, as organizations integrate AI into their operations, they must remember: technology should support people, not replace them.

Series A software companies have reduced their teams from an average of 22 employees in 2022 to just 15 in 2024...and as the Carta data shows, across most early stages in venture, team sizes have declined pretty strongly since 2022.\n\nWhile economic factors like the funding crunch & increased focus on capital efficiency certainly explain part of this trend, the AI factor cannot be ignored. When founders explicitly state they're delaying hires because their current team + AI tools can handle more work than expected, we're seeing a real-time demonstration of how AI will impact employment patterns.\n\nThis aligns with what economists call \"technological unemployment\" - but with an important nuance. In previous technological revolutions, automation typically displaced lower-skilled jobs first. AI's impact appears to be affecting knowledge workers at the outset, changing the sequence we've historically observed.\n\nThere's also evidence that AI tools are creating new categories of jobs and enhancing productivity in ways that could ultimately expand employment in different areas. The \"AI productivity paradox\" might be that while individual companies need fewer employees, the broader ecosystem could generate more total jobs through new ventures, enhanced capabilities, and novel business models.\n\nWhat's your perspective? Are you seeing AI primarily as a job displacement force or as a productivity multiplier that might ultimately create more opportunity?",

        "text": "There\u2019s an enormous economic transformation on the horizon. Here's the math that should make every investor and entrepreneur take notice. If leaps in digital assistants and robotics can take over just 1% of current tasks in white- and blue-collar labor categories, that alone is a $100 billion opportunity. This isn't speculative future-gazing. This is based on current labor spending data from the Department of Labor of the $10 trillion US\n\nLook at these annual-spend numbers from these perpetually in-demand and often understaffed job categories:\n\n\nRegistered Nurses - $300 billion\nSoftware Developers - $284 billion\nPhysicians - $189 billion\nAccountants and Auditors - $130 billion\nFinancial Analysts and Advisors - $93 billion\n\nWe're not talking about replacing jobs. We're talking about multiplying human productivity. Imagine AI agents that can handle routine tasks, allowing professionals to focus on high-value, creative work.\n\nBut what about the technology that already exists in these industries? Agents do, while traditional SaaS merely digitizes. This fundamental difference creates unprecedented potential for value creation, especially in industries with scarcity, inflationary, and dangerous conditions.\n\nHere are several sectors ripe for transformation\n\n\nInflationary: Healthcare administration wastes $1 trillion annually, with clinicians spending up to 25% of their time not on patient care Agents can help increase efficiency and bring down costs by performing rote.\n\n\nScare: Financial advisory services face massive demographic shifts, with up to 40% of advisors\u2014managing $11 trillion in assets\u2014planning to retire in the next decade. AI can help by multiplying the productivity of the remaining workforce.\n\n\nDangerous: Warehouse and last-mile delivery sectors have more dangerous working conditions than any other sector, resulting in 3.8 serious injuries per 100 workers per year. More advanced robotics can make a big difference.\n\nVenture investors have already noticed. Legal tech and software engineering are attracting a wave of investment. And we're still in the early innings of this transformation.\n\nThe future isn't about AI versus humans. It's about AI with humans, dramatically expanding what's possible.\n\ncc:",

As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.\n\nIf the US faces a recession in 2025, it will \"Turbocharge\" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapore\u2019s economic growth to be between 1% and 3%\u2014a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.\n\nAt the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.\n\nLooking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globally\u2014but we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.\n\nThe key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?\n\nWhat do you think?",

This research investigates the multifaceted implications of this transformation, exploring its effects on productivity, employment dynamics, required skills, and ethical considerations. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach involving a systematic literature review of ISI-indexed journals and a case study analysis of a Fortune 500 company implementing AI automation, we examine the evolving relationship between humans and intelligent machines in the workplace. Our findings reveal a significant increase in productivity and efficiency due to AI automation, but also a shift in required skills, highlighting the growing demand for roles focused on AI development, management, and oversight. The research also underscores the importance of addressing ethical concerns such as algorithmic bias, job displacement, and the need for responsible AI implementation. We conclude that while AI automation presents immense opportunities for economic growth and innovation, careful consideration of its societal impact and proactive strategies for workforce adaptation are crucial for navigating the changing landscape of work.\n\n\nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence, Automation, Future of Work, Productivity, Employment, Ethics\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe rapid advancement and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation technologies are fundamentally reshaping the nature of work. This transformation, often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, presents both opportunities and challenges for businesses, workers, and society as a whole. From automating routine tasks to augmenting human capabilities, AI is driving significant changes in the workplace, creating new job roles while simultaneously rendering others obsolete.\nExisting research has examined various aspects of AI's impact on work, including productivity gains, the changing nature of jobs, and the emergence of new skill requirements. However, there is a need for comprehensive research that integrates these diverse perspectives and explores the complex interplay between technological advancements, organizational strategies, and societal implications.\nThis research aims to address this gap by investigating the multifaceted implications of enterprise AI automation on the future of work. We explore the impact of AI on productivity, employment dynamics, required skills, and ethical considerations. Through a mixed-methods approach, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the transformative potential of AI and offer insights into how organizations and individuals can navigate this evolving landscape.\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of relevant literature, analyzing existing research on AI and au",

        "text": "AI & the Future of Work: What Does the Data Say?\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has released a new report analyzing the impact of AI on employment projections (2023\u20132033). Contrary to popular fears of mass job losses, the findings highlight a more nuanced reality:\n\n- AI is transforming jobs, not just replacing them. Many professions will see increased efficiency and demand, rather than outright displacement.\n- Tech roles are growing: Software developers (+17.9%) and data specialists benefit from automation rather than being replaced by it. A surprise for many!\n- Routine jobs are declining: AI is taking over repetitive administrative tasks, leading to a reduction in support roles.\n- Expertise still matters: Financial advisors, engineers, and regulated professions remain in demand \u2013 where human judgment is critical, AI enhances rather than replaces.\n- AI adoption is slower than expected: Regulatory barriers, integration complexity, and societal acceptance slow down the impact\n\nKey takeaway from this report: AI is a powerful tool, but not an instant disruptor. The real transformation happens where technology meets human expertise.\n\nBased on my personal experience running some AI projects:\nShort term gains are inflated, especially by software sales trying to sell products and expertise. \"Turn-key-solutions\" are the most impactful tools right now with high probability of successful implementation and fast break-evens (for example in cyber-security). Customized projects scale very slow and external expertise for successful implementation is hard to find - if any.\n\nSo bottom-line: the short term impact is overrated, the long term transformation still underrated - at least based on my personal experience and this data..\n\nAgree?",

Here are three key shifts happening right now:\n\n\u2705 Outcome-Based Work Over Job Titles\nForget rigid job descriptions.

Payroll specialists will need to upskill, focusing on compliance consulting, system implementation, and strategic payroll advisory rather than just processing pay runs.\n\nAI is not here to replace payroll jobs. It\u2019s here to redefine them. The ones that benefit will be those who can adapt.",

From resume screening to chatbots handling initial candidate interactions, AI is speeding up recruitment like never before.\n\nBut here\u2019s the big question: Will AI replace recruiters?\n\nNot so fast. While AI can:\n\u2705 Automate resume screening & reduce bias (in theory)\n\u2705 Speed up initial outreach & scheduling\n\u2705 Analyze data to predict candidate success\n\nIt can\u2019t replace the human touch. Hiring is more than keywords and algorithms\u2014it's about people. AI won\u2019t build relationships, assess culture fit, or guide candidates through career decisions. That\u2019s where great recruiters shine.\n\nInstead of fearing AI, recruiters should embrace it as a tool to work smarter, not harder.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? Is AI the future of recruiting, or will human recruiters always be essential? Let\u2019s discuss! \ud83d\udc47",

That's not just factory jobs\u2014it's accountants, writers, analysts, even lawyers.\n\nBut here's the twist: AI isn\u2019t simply \"replacing\" jobs; it's redefining roles. Tasks become automated, but human oversight, strategy, and creativity become even more critical.\n\nI've personally seen it happen in my own industry: Those who embraced AI early aren\u2019t losing their jobs\u2014they\u2019re reinventing them. Those who resisted are now scrambling to keep up.\n\nAI won't steal your job, but someone who knows how to use it effectively just might.

It's a topic that's both exciting and, let's be honest, a little bit unsettling.\n\nWe're seeing AI reshape industries, automate tasks, and create entirely new roles we couldn't have imagined a few years ago. Think about how AI is already assisting with everything from customer service to data analysis, even creative endeavors like writing and art. This means opportunities, sure, but also significant shifts in the skills we need and the ways we work.\n\nI was reading a piece the other day about how important \"soft skills\" are becoming. Seems like emotional intelligence, communication, and critical thinking are going to be more valuable than ever. Which, ironically, is good news for the human race! \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: how do we prepare ourselves and our teams for this rapidly evolving landscape? What training do we need? How do we ensure a just transition for workers whose jobs are automated? And, perhaps most importantly, how do we retain our humanity in a world increasingly powered by algorithms?\n\nWhat are your biggest concerns (or excitements!) about AI's impact on your industry?

As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.\n\nIf the US faces a recession in 2025, it will \"Turbocharge\" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapore\u2019s economic growth to be between 1% and 3%\u2014a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.\n\nAt the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.\n\nLooking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globally\u2014but we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.\n\nThe key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?\n\nWhat do you think?",

We keep rushing toward \u2018progress\u2019 like a herd charging blindly toward a pit.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to rethink work itself. Ikigai\u2014doing what we love, what we\u2019re good at, and what the world needs\u2014might just be the way to stay relevant. Instead of clinging to outdated roles, should we focus on building careers AI won\u2019t steal (at least not yet)?",

        "text": "The Age of AI Agents: Are We Ready for the Fallout?\n\nRumor has it OpenAI is gearing up to launch AI \u201cagents\u201d costing anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000 a month. These things are supposedly powerful enough to replace human roles in sales, coding, and even high-level research. SoftBank alone might throw in $3 billion this year\u2014and that\u2019s just one investor!\n\nWhat happens when these AI agents start doing jobs that used to pay people good salaries? Well, during the 2008 crisis, around 30 million people lost their jobs, and global GDP dipped roughly 1.3%. If AI displaces tens or hundreds of millions, we\u2019re looking at a major economic contraction. Some projections say that by 2045, a huge chunk\u2014maybe 90%\u2014of today\u2019s workforce could be out of traditional work. That\u2019s a shake-up like we\u2019ve never seen.\n\nSo, what would that even look like?\n\u2022 Economy\nWith fewer jobs to go around, governments might have to roll out Universal Basic Income (UBI) or similar safety nets. AI-driven companies could end up holding most of the wealth, unless we figure out how to share the gains.\n\u2022 Social Life & Meaning\nIf people aren\u2019t working regular jobs, they\u2019ll focus on creativity, community, and personal growth. We might see more artisan crafts, immersive events, and a culture of self-improvement. But if policies don\u2019t keep up, we could face massive inequality, with a small elite and everyone else scraping by on basic income.\n\nThe takeaway? These AI agents are coming fast, and they\u2019ll change our world in ways that are hard to predict. The real question isn\u2019t just whether they\u2019ll arrive\u2014it\u2019s how we\u2019ll adapt our economy and everyday life once they do. Because 2045 might seem far off, but at this pace, it\u2019ll be here before we know it.",

We don't have effective leadership, instead we have someone fixated on changing the names of a major body of water, invading Canada, and gaining blackmail material on the entire country.\n\nIf the second branch is true, then a lot of businesses are going to have egg on their face when they lay off all of those programmers then discover that LLMs still NEED those programmers to be able to ask intelligent questions ... and that is the BEST case scenario.\n\nGoing back to bed sounds like a good plan right now.",

While AI brings efficiency, automation, and new opportunities, it also raises concerns about job displacement. The big question: Which roles are most at risk?\n\nHere are a few categories facing major disruption:\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Repetitive & Rule-Based Jobs\n\ud83d\udc49 Data entry, bookkeeping, telemarketing, and even basic legal document review are increasingly automated.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Customer Support & Sales Roles\n\ud83d\udc49 AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are replacing tier-1 customer service roles. Sales prospecting tools can now automate lead generation.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Routine Manual Labor\n\ud83d\udc49 Warehouse operations, cashiers, and some construction tasks are seeing automation through robotics.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Basic Content Creation\n\ud83d\udc49 AI tools can generate blog posts, summarize reports, and even create simple marketing copy\u2014though human creativity still holds the edge.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom! New AI-driven roles are emerging, including:\n\n\u2705 AI Ethicists & Policy Experts \u2013 To ensure responsible AI use.\n\u2705 Prompt Engineers \u2013 Optimizing AI models for better outputs.\n\u2705 AI-Assisted Product Managers \u2013 Leveraging AI insights to build smarter products.\n\nThe key takeaway? Adaptability is the new job security. The best way to future-proof your career is to embrace AI, develop problem-solving skills, and focus on roles that require human creativity, emotional intelligence, and strategic thinking.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

But these factors can vary dramatically from one country to the next. Failing to consider the firm often leads forecasters to apply identical extrapolations across national economies. Even in settings with comparable labor costs, however, a firm\u2019s propensity to automate may be constrained by other rigidities specific to individual labor markets, like legal regimes that make job cuts difficult, as can be the case in Europe.\n\ud83d\udfe5 The mystery of price elasticity of demand\nSuppose it were true that frighteningly large numbers of jobs were at real risk of automation.

But as adoption grows, so do the challenges.\n\nHere are some of the key limitations we're seeing:\n\nBias in, bias out. AI learns from historical data. If that data reflects biased hiring patterns, the AI risks reinforcing them.\n\nBeyond keywords. Great talent isn't always in a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. AI can miss candidates with unconventional career paths or transferable skills that don\u2019t fit traditional models.\n\nCultural fit and soft skills. Attributes like adaptability, creativity, and leadership potential are difficult for algorithms to assess accurately.\n\nDynamic role requirements. Business needs evolve quickly. AI models may lag behind, relying on outdated parameters.\n\nCandidate experience. Over-automation can make the process feel impersonal, pushing away top talent who expect a human touch.\n\nThe future of talent search isn't AI vs. human expertise\u2014it's finding the right balance between technology and empathy, data and judgment.\n\nAI is here to stay, but so is the irreplaceable value of human connection.\n\nCurious to hear: How are you using AI in your talent strategies\u2014and where do you still rely on human insight?",

Series A software companies have reduced their teams from an average of 22 employees in 2022 to just 15 in 2024...and as the Carta data shows, across most early stages in venture, team sizes have declined pretty strongly since 2022.\n\nWhile economic factors like the funding crunch & increased focus on capital efficiency certainly explain part of this trend, the AI factor cannot be ignored. When founders explicitly state they're delaying hires because their current team + AI tools can handle more work than expected, we're seeing a real-time demonstration of how AI will impact employment patterns.\n\nThis aligns with what economists call \"technological unemployment\" - but with an important nuance. In previous technological revolutions, automation typically displaced lower-skilled jobs first. AI's impact appears to be affecting knowledge workers at the outset, changing the sequence we've historically observed.\n\nThere's also evidence that AI tools are creating new categories of jobs and enhancing productivity in ways that could ultimately expand employment in different areas. The \"AI productivity paradox\" might be that while individual companies need fewer employees, the broader ecosystem could generate more total jobs through new ventures, enhanced capabilities, and novel business models.\n\nWhat's your perspective? Are you seeing AI primarily as a job displacement force or as a productivity multiplier that might ultimately create more opportunity?",

ChatGPT, in particular, has shown impressive capabilities in generating code, answering technical questions, and even providing coding suggestions.\n\nOn the other hand, many argue that AI will never be able to replace the creativity, problem-solving skills, and emotional intelligence that human developers bring to the table. Moreover, as AI takes over more routine tasks, there's a risk that developers will lose their jobs or be relegated to menial tasks.\n\nSo, what do you think? Will ChatGPT and AI-powered tools augment human developers or replace them? Share your thoughts and opinions!\n\nSome questions to consider:\n\n- Can AI truly replicate the complexity and nuance of human thought and creativity?\n- Will AI-powered tools lead to job displacement or new job creation for developers?\n- How can we ensure that AI is developed and used responsibly in the development process?",

This fact shows how dramatically work changes across generations.\n\nAs someone who inspires GTM teams with what's possible with AI using real-life use cases, I've wondered how many current jobs were brand new in the last century. Could our past workforce shifts guide our approach to AI?\n\nI wanted to test new AI models, so I used the newly released ChatGPT-4.5 to research U.S. job evolution over the last 100 years.\n\nGuiding teams through change isn't just about technology. It's about meeting people where they are and creating clear paths for upskilling. When humans and AI work together as teammates, the results are powerful.\n\nThe research confirmed workers have continuously adapted to new technologies:\n\n\u25ba Farm workers learned to use tractors\n\n\u25ba Factory workers adopted computer systems\n\n\u25ba Office workers used digital tools\n\nSociety also created entirely new careers like wellness coaches and social media managers that previous generations couldn't have imagined.\n\nNow AI brings another major transition. The World Economic Forum predicts AI will create around 170 million new jobs worldwide by 2030, far more than it replaces.\n\nCurious, I asked ChatGPT to tell me what some of these new jobs might be. Here are five that stood out:\n\n\u25ba AI Transparency Advocate - Making sure AI decisions remain trustworthy\n\n\u25ba Virtual Reality Workplace Designer - Creating spaces for remote collaboration\n\n\u25ba Digital Detox Specialist - Supporting healthy technology boundaries (I can definitely see the need for this one.)\n\n\u25ba AI-Powered Ecosystem Restoration Manager - Using AI to repair natural environments\n\n\u25ba Personal Data Broker - Helping people manage their data ethically\n\nChatGPT-4.5 provided the research that Claude Sonnet 3.7 (also new) turned into the graphic below.\n\nSee the link to a doc with the full research report and my prompts in the comments,.\n\nI do think that this AI transition will be much tougher. In previous innovations, it took time for them to happen... electricity/put up power lines, lay fiber in the ground, etc. AI is now able to leverage all that infrastructure in place. So the changes are much faster. The question is: how fast can we adapt?\n\nWill AI follow historical patterns where technology creates more jobs than it eliminates? Are you preparing your teams to work alongside AI effectively? I'd love to hear your approach.",

        "text": "The AI Revolution: Will ChatGPT Replace Human Developers?\n\nAs AI technology continues to advance, the question on everyone's mind is: will ChatGPT and other AI-powered tools replace human developers?\n\nOn one hand, AI has the potential to revolutionize the development process, automating repetitive tasks, improving accuracy, and enhancing user experience. ChatGPT, in particular, has shown impressive capabilities in generating code, answering technical questions, and even providing coding suggestions.\n\nOn the other hand, many argue that AI will never be able to replace the creativity, problem-solving skills, and emotional intelligence that human developers bring to the table. Moreover, as AI takes over more routine tasks, there's a risk that developers will lose their jobs or be relegated to menial tasks.\n\nSo, what do you think? Will ChatGPT and AI-powered tools augment human developers or replace them? Share your thoughts and opinions!\n\nSome questions to consider:\n\n- Can AI truly replicate the complexity and nuance of human thought and creativity?\n- Will AI-powered tools lead to job displacement or new job creation for developers?\n- How can we ensure that AI is developed and used responsibly in the development process?",

It takes human input to \u201cmotivate\u201d the AI to produce an output.\n\nMuch of the hiring process is deciding between multiple, qualified candidates, and evaluating how those people are motivated.\n\nWhen I deploy AI tools for customers, most of the work is in getting the AI to follow the right cues, and respond with the right \u201cmindset.\u201d\n\nThis work is worth it, because the AI I deploy is 1/10 (or less) of the cost of a human counterpart, AND, you only \u201cpay\u201d the AI when it is working. A human agent has to be paid even if no chat requests are coming in.\n\nThe strongest use case for OpenAI is to continue pursuing general intelligence, while enabling integration with custom datasets.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol, which they have open sourced, should be integrated into every LLM natively, allowing native integration with external services. This would be much more valuable endeavor for OpenAI than specialized AI agents.\n\nAI is the way, but it is not so powerful that we simply discard the cost/benefit analysis.

Do you think AI can do the work of its 700 customer service workers?\n\nBased on what I have seen, it\u2019s feasible. However, would you trust AI to manage financial transactions and decide who to extend credit to? As AI breezes past our benchmarks, is it ready to take on more roles?\n\nGemini can ace the Bar Exam but isn\u2019t a competent lawyer. ChatGPT can solve LeetCode challenges and pass software engineer interviews but isn\u2019t capable of coding solutions independently.\n\nGenAI is showing how weak our assessment tools are. They advance the most primitive types of intelligence to the front of the line without evaluating more complex, higher-value capabilities.\n\nThere\u2019s a cottage industry that prepares candidates to interview for tech jobs and pass tests because the capabilities required to do the job successfully differ from those required to get hired.\n\nResearchers have been identifying gaps for decades, but we\u2019re only now building more accurate assessments in response to AI\u2019s progress. Business leaders and academia should take note.\n\nCEOs who look at AI through the lens of narrow benchmarks and demos will replace people with platforms that aren\u2019t up to the job.\n\nCompanies that hire based on weak assessment tools will be staffed by replaceable workers, not the future capabilities they need to remain competitive.\n\nUniversities that admit based on standardized test scores and teach students to pass surface-level capabilities assessments prepare students for jobs that will not exist when they graduate.\n\nBusinesses and academia must get in front of this trend. Most courses are obsolete. Curricula must be realigned with the future of work, not the easily automated skills of the past.\n\nThe number of obsolete jobs is growing. Hiring must look past the AI replacement cycle to bring in the resilient capabilities the business needs to survive.\n\nIf we don\u2019t adapt, we\u2019ll have a generation of businesses and workers who can\u2019t compete in the AI marketplace.",

It tested seven LLMs: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Amazon Nova, Meta Llama, and Alibaba Qwen.\n\nTheir goal was to see how well the models could complete real world tasks and real world companies.\n\nThey gave the AIs 175 different tasks you'd find in a typical workplace.\n\nThings like:\n\u2014 Writing and fixing code\n\u2014 Managing team projects\n\u2014 Dealing with HR stuff\n\u2014 Handling company finances\n\nHere is a summary of the results:\n\n\u2014 The best-performing AI was Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\u2014 Despite it being the best, Claude could complete 24% of its tasks.\n\u2014 Each task relatively expensive, costing about $6.34 in computing power.\n\u2014 The AI often needed around 30 attempts to figure things out.\n\u2014 Other models, like GPT-4o took fewer steps, but their success rate was quite low (~14 steps).\n\u2014 AI agents did best with technical stuff like coding. But struggled with things that required common sense and social skills.\n\u2014 Sometimes the AIs would make up solutions instead of solving the problem.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nAs of today, AI is nowhere near ready to replace human workers.",

Even though artificial intelligence (AI) in computer vision can automate some operations, businesses currently find that it is more cost-effective to retain human personnel.\nThe study, however, only considers a particular kind of AI; large language models (LLMs), which have more capabilities, are a wild card. Compared to computer vision systems, fine-tuning LLMs might be easier and less expensive, which could speed up automation.\nThis study highlights the importance of continued discussions regarding the future of work in the AI era. While certain jobs will undoubtedly change, the primary goal should be to prepare the workforce to adapt and interact well with AI tools.",

As we know, LLMs have received wide acceptance in society, which has, however, raised concerns about whether AI will replace us as humans.\n\nI have had to unlearn and relearn the dynamics of AI and understand how far it has come to be part of our lives. What we may not realize is that AI has been with us since our great-grandparents' time; we just didn\u2019t recognize it. Think about it: we use navigation systems in our cars and mobile devices, facial recognition, biometrics, weather forecasts on our phones, and more. AI has been there, ever-growing like a seed, becoming more advanced and smarter.\n\nSo, the question again: will AI take over our jobs? The answer is no. Artificial intelligence is here to enhance our productivity and help us work smarter, not to replace us. Here are some things I learned: AI for Business, Building a Website, Making Audio with AI, Making Animations with AI, Making and Editing Videos, Buzzwords in AI, Prompt Engineering, LLMs, GenAI, Finding Remote Jobs, LinkedIn Optimization, ATS for CVs and Cover Letters, and Acing Interviews, among others.\n\nThank you ALX Ghana for this opportunity.",

The answer: 4.8 million American jobs.

Currently, ChatGPT is most widely used to support workers in a range of industries, helping them complete tasks that still require human judgment. ... The outplacement firm also asked the LLM another straightforward question: \"What jobs can ChatGPT replace?\" It answered that its capabilities make it best suited to take over roles that are centered on language and that are repetitive and predictable.\n\nChatGPT predicted that LLMs could one day replace workers in the following roles:\n--Customer service representatives\n--Technical writers\n--Translators and interpreters\n--Copywriters\n--Data entry clerks\n\nFields that ChatGPT sees itself as most capable of entering include:\n--Data science\n--Machine learning\n--Computer science\n--Mathematics and statistics\n--Robotics and automation\n\nTo be sure, as with past cycles of innovation, tools like ChatGPT could potentially create more jobs than it eliminates.

Then, I apply for a job with a description that's basically what I've been doing regularly and get a generic response along the lines of \"You're not suitable\", without a single personal conversation!\n\nThe second is the notion that \"AI/LLMs\" are going to replace developers so companies don't need that many developers.\nHere's the puzzle, I can't get into companies with developers that the companies believe they can replace with AI/LLM? It's puzzling because any good developer knows you can't replace a good developer with AI.\nIt'll be like saying because we developed mechanised boats, sailors, captains, bowmen, etc. are no longer needed. You can definitely get your mechanised boat to move but without a sailor/captain, it most likely ends up in Bermuda3Eck. Same with LLMs, you can use them to generate your apps but you'll definitely find out why you needed a developer too.\n\nI use Gemini in Android Studio and it's very helpful with complex refactorings, in-context code generation, generating tests, etc. But it hallucinates, assumes the wrong things, etc, and without my proper understanding of the product, requirements, programming language, libraries, and SDKs those hallucinations will pass through to the user. Gemini is a good assistant, but it's not an engineer.\n\nIn conclusion, I think recruiters should create a system that enables them to have time to have conversations with experienced developers before making a decision. And if you have developers that can be replaced with AI, please let me in. I'll bring you more value with AI/LLM as my assistant.",

It tested seven LLMs: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Amazon Nova, Meta Llama, and Alibaba Qwen.\n\nTheir goal was to see how well the models could complete real world tasks and real world companies.\n\nThey gave the AIs 175 different tasks you'd find in a typical workplace.\n\nThings like:\n\u2014 Writing and fixing code\n\u2014 Managing team projects\n\u2014 Dealing with HR stuff\n\u2014 Handling company finances\n\nHere is a summary of the results:\n\n\u2014 The best-performing AI was Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\u2014 Despite it being the best, Claude could complete 24% of its tasks.\n\u2014 Each task relatively expensive, costing about $6.34 in computing power.\n\u2014 The AI often needed around 30 attempts to figure things out.\n\u2014 Other models, like GPT-4o took fewer steps, but their success rate was quite low (~14 steps).\n\u2014 AI agents did best with technical stuff like coding. But struggled with things that required common sense and social skills.\n\u2014 Sometimes the AIs would make up solutions instead of solving the problem.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nAs of today, AI is nowhere near ready to replace human workers.",

But it is important to know where AI is going to take over and where AI is going to increase opportunities for techies.\n\nA good portion of software developer jobs fall in the \u201cshould not exist\u201d category\u2014think software testing and maintenance. These will be under definitive threat from AI agents like 'computer use'. I don't think there is any other way out for the devs in this space than to move out by learning new languages, tools and AI tech.\n\nNext in line is full stack - Github is full of fullstack code and the LLMs are learning them very fast. 'No-code' dev platforms like Replit, Bubble etc are aggressively targeting this space as ROI is very attractive. Devs in this space need to become 10x engineers very fast using AI-assisted coding to just keep ahead and survive.\n\nPeople working on AI/ML development have to make domain knowledge their primary strength and not coding. The first choice for them should be to become product managers as soon as possible. Idea to fully functional product - They should be able to do the entire chain.\n\n\u2705 The Future is in IT Infrastructure \ud83d\udd25\n\nI\u2019m very optimistic about core IT jobs\u2014data centers, system admin, security, MLops, and AI deployment.\n\nWhy?\nBecause AI needs humongous infrastructure. And every AI product I\u2019ve built and seen built needed very clever human ingenuity in infra to deploy and run at scale. This opportunity will boom to 100x soon.\n\nIf I were starting my career today, I\u2019d go straight into IT infrastructure.\n\nSome of the core infra jobs that will see a high demand in the AI age are:\n\n\u2705 System design (GPU clouds, serverless compute, platform as service)\n\u2705 Model deployment (AL/ML deployment platforms like sagemaker/ AzureML/Vertex AI, containers like docker, orchestrators like kubernetes)\n\u2705 Edge computing\n\u2705 Multi-cloud orchestration\n\u2705 Identity management\n\u2705 Security management\n\u2705 Run time infrastructure monitoring\n\u2705 Storage management\n\nThe next 10 years belong to those who build and optimize the AI-powered world.",

The goal was to use as much AI as possible to do the copy editing, in other words, reduce the reliance on humans to do copy editing (I'm, of course, euphamising ).\n\nAfter two years, and a huge amount of money spent, they finally deployed it into production. They soon realized that it wasn't good enough, and everything the AI did finally had to be double checked and corrected by a human. Essentially, the time taken by the human to check and correct the output was the same as if the human had done it from start to finish without any AI help.\n\nThey disbanded their (by now quite large) AI/DS team, and decommissioned the platform they had built. They went back to humans doing what they were doing, the old school way.\n\nStory 2:\n\nA rich law firm (which, again, shall remain unnamed) that a contact works in also tried to do similar things to replace paralegals. They employed a large number of highly paid AI engineers/Data scientists to create something that could reduce their paralegal costs (aka help make some paralegal staff redundant and still do the job). After a lot of time and money, they found the solution unreliable, and went back to the old way.\n\n\nP.S. - Some additional context on the copy editing story. I was quite surprised by what my contact said, and asked why it was the case when grammar checkers are really quite good these days. My contact explained to me was that copy-editing involves more than just grammar correction. If grammar correction was all that was needed, spelling and grammar checkers would have replaced copy editors years, if not a decade, ago.",

But despite their impressive abilities, AI's current limitations mean it still requires a human hand to be effective.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f In healthcare, AI can diagnose diseases but is prone to bias without human oversight.

The master Excel file is classic: dozens of interconnected worksheets, hundreds of columns, and millions of rows. It definitely won't work when Automatic calculation is enabled, and would crash Excel once every few hours. Preparing the input data often took hours, and only one person can fix it if something goes wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve worked with Excel for over 20 years and thought I\u2019m pretty good at it - until I get to know this file :)\n\nIn the past, to get this task done I would have spent weeks manually mapping the logic onto an A2-sized piece of paper, and would probably need help from others if the deadline is tight. But this is 2024, so I pasted all the formulae to an LLM and asked it to map dependencies, remove redundancies, explain the logic in layman terms, then generate the replacement code. The bulk of the work was done in less than two days, leaving ample time for coffee and self reflection.\n\nCould it be done without AI? Absolutely yes - but at a much higher cost in time and effort. And when it's done it's quite likely that there's no time left for documentation. Meaning we'd shift the complexity from Excel to SQL/Python, and the business reliance on one business guru to that same business guru PLUS that dude in the data team. The LLM in this case generates the technical and business explanations quite effortlessly IF the code works.\n\nDid the code work on the first try? Hell no. Sometimes I wondered whether it's quicker just to go back to the A2-sized logic map, but the final result actually spoke for itself.\n\nOther fun facts:\n\n- It feels like working with an 8-year-old genius, which explains why the code doesn't always work. The difference is that it's capabilities are improved at a stunning pace and it doesn't age like Tam :)\n- I used a few LLMs just to observe how they performed: chagpt o1, chatgpt 4o, claude 3.5 - either directly or via GitHub copilot. No clear winner came out but I think o1 is slightly better but consistently inconsistent. Haven't tried Gemini 2.0 which was not available when I started the work.\n- I guess the use cases where LLMs are adding the most values now are those with a more deterministic outcomes like the one above. Ironically the very same LLMs used elsewhere are generating so much noise that we fail to identify practical use cases that are right under our noses\n\nSo yes, the Tam using AI is slowly - but very surely - replacing the old Tam. And I'm feeling good about it.\n\nAre you having similar experiences? if yes I'm keen to hear!\n\n(this post is inspired a recent post by)",

Fewer people think of the AI impact on\u2026\n. They may think they are immune. Is it clear? Not so sure\u2026 Can AI replace managers? Maybe, at least partially. On top managers who know how to use properly AI will replace managers who don\u2019t. And how many AI-enabled workers will outpace their late-adopter colleagues?\n\nA new Capgemini research found that only 15% of leaders and managers consistently use generative AI in their daily work. They may be well aware of its potential to enhance various aspects of their roles, but they\u2019re not making the integration step yet. However, a similar study of management students found that 40% of them use generative AI multiple times per day. So when and how will tomorrow\u2019s managers influence todays?\n\nOrganizations should look to leverage younger generative AI talent into existing workflows, allowing them to champion AI-related projects and seek their input, no matter their possible lack of seniority. More experienced colleagues remain indispensable to contribute the contextual knowledge and organizational smarts to make these projects a reality. Reverse mentoring could be key!\n\nCompanies must also be prepared to update the skills, career paths and promotion criteria that have been more or less set in stone for years \u2013 allowing AI-first talent to make a difference. New skills emerge. Just as SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and social media skills were new but quickly became essential 15-20 years ago, emerging fields like LLM optimization are set to flourish and need to be planned for.\n\nHow will we keep generative AI-ready talent engaged and allow them to bring their full contribution at your own organizations? Or have you seen examples of new hires frustrated by their entry into the corporate world? Let me know below\u2026",
