Faster, more efficient, and data-driven hiring decisions. But the big question remains: Can AI truly understand human potential?\n\nMany organizations are adopting AI-powered recruitment tools to eliminate human bias, streamline processes, and improve candidate matching. However, critics argue that AI might be reinforcing biases instead of removing them. After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.\nThe Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring\n\n✅ Why AI is a Game-Changer:\n✔ Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.\n✔ Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.\n✔ Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.\n\n⚠ Concerns About AI in Recruitment:\n❌ Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.\n❌ Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?\n❌ Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.\nWith technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?\n\n💬 We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Recently, I encountered a weird hiring trend that raises serious ethical concerns.\n\nI appeared for an interview with a company, only to later realize that a third-party AI analytics company was also present, silently observing my performance. After the interview, instead of hearing back from the employer, I received an email from this third-party company—analyzing my performance and offering me another interview.\n\nThis made me question:\n🔹 Was my interview data shared without my consent?\n🔹 Did the hiring company get paid for ‘selling’ my interview performance?\n🔹 Was there ever a real job vacancy, or was this just a data-harvesting scheme?\n\nIt seems like a new form of bogus hiring, where companies conduct interviews not to hire, but to sell candidates’ data to third-party AI firms—monetizing our efforts without any accountability. No feedback, no job offer, just data exploitation.\n\n💡 To all job seekers: Be cautious. If something feels off about a hiring process, trust your instincts. Always research the company and question suspicious practices.\n\n💬 To recruiters and companies: Candidates put in immense effort to prepare for interviews. Playing with their hopes and careers is unethical and unacceptable. Hiring should be about talent acquisition, not data monetization.\n\n🚀 Let’s spread awareness and demand fair hiring practices!

Roles once exclusive to humans are increasingly handled by AI and automation across industries—from healthcare to travel. This shift may seem like jobs are disappearing, but in truth, new opportunities are emerging just as quickly.\n\nAlbert Einstein famously said, \"In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.\" This is exactly the case with AI. While some jobs are lost, new ones are created—whether in AI development, automation management, or entirely new industries yet to be imagined. Every technological leap brings both challenges and fresh opportunities.\n\nBut to seize these opportunities, adaptability is key.\n\nBy equipping the next generation with practical skills and a deep understanding of AI, we’re not just preparing them for the future—we’re empowering them to shape it. Success isn’t about competing with AI; it’s about working alongside it, innovating with it, and leveraging it as a tool for creativity and progress.\n\nLet’s train, inspire, and empower young minds to embrace AI—not as a threat, but as an ally. Together, we’re building a future-ready workforce.\n\nHow do you see AI shaping the job market of tomorrow? Let’s discuss!",

Today’s news proves otherwise. The biggest companies are cutting \"underperformers\" and replacing them with AI and cheaper labor.\n\nThis isn’t a reorg. This isn’t \"business as usual.\" This is a wake-up call.\n\n💡 If you’re in tech, upskilling in AI won’t be enough - understanding business strategy will be.\n💡 If you’re in leadership, how are you future-proofing your team?\n💡 If you’re in the job market, diversify your skills ASAP.\n\nWe’re not in an AI revolution. We’re in an AI job crisis.\n\nAgree or disagree? Let’s discuss. 🔥",

Aon’s latest study https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gAHCYinm screams mass resignation, but reality paints a different picture:\n\n❌ The job market isn’t what it used to be. Companies are tightening hiring, AI is reshaping roles, and quitting without a solid plan could mean getting left behind.\n❌ The “Great Stay” is real. Surveys show employees want to leave, yet actual quit rates remain low. Why? Fear. Of instability. Of obsolescence. Of jumping ship with nowhere to land.\n❌ AI is coming - will you fight or flee? 29% of Singapore employees don’t trust their companies to upskill them for the future. But here’s the truth: you’re either adapting or you’re replaceable.\n\n💡 The real question isn’t \"Should I quit?\" It’s \"Am I evolving fast enough to survive?\"\n\nPlay smart.

As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.\n\nIf the US faces a recession in 2025, it will \"Turbocharge\" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapore’s economic growth to be between 1% and 3%—a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.\n\nAt the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.\n\nLooking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globally—but we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.\n\nThe key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?\n\nWhat do you think?",

Faster, more efficient, and data-driven hiring decisions. But the big question remains: Can AI truly understand human potential?\n\nMany organizations are adopting AI-powered recruitment tools to eliminate human bias, streamline processes, and improve candidate matching.

After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.\nThe Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring\n\n✅ Why AI is a Game-Changer:\n✔ Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.\n✔ Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.\n✔ Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.\n\n⚠ Concerns About AI in Recruitment:\n❌ Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.\n❌ Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?\n❌ Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.\nWith technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?\n\n💬 We'd love to hear your thoughts!

In fact, it's vice versa, because:\n\n- Candidate will feel more relaxed during the interview if AI usage is allowed.\n- It's much easier to understand a candidate's fundamental knowledge by prompts.\n- If used well and properly, AI can save you months, if not years of work.\n\nAI should be tested and used wisely.\n\nIt can help us do our jobs better, not take them away.\n\nLearn fundamentals today, and AI will take your career to the next level.\n\nTry to ignore AI knowledge, and you will hire Engineers like this.\n\nTry to bypass the system, and more examples like this are on the way soon.",

Meanwhile, the world is facing severe water shortages, with 2.2 billion people lacking access to safe drinking water.\nWhy is this not being talked about?

Companies rushing to automate everything, only to realize efficiency without strategy just creates new problems.\n2. Companies resisting AI entirely, only to fall behind competitors who use it to enhance human decision-making.\n\nAt FBSPL, we’re focused on the third path: AI as an amplifier, not a replacement.

About 36% of occupations see AI used in at least a quarter of their tasks, while only 4% use it for three-quarters of their tasks.\n\n- AI is more about augmentation (57%) than automation (43%)—meaning it’s enhancing human work rather than replacing it outright.\n\n- AI usage is highest in mid-to-high-wage jobs like programming and data science. It’s notably lower in both the lowest- and highest-paid jobs, likely due to AI’s current limitations and practical adoption barriers.\n\n- Both low-wage and ultra-high-wage roles see little AI adoption—jobs requiring manual dexterity (like shampooers) or specialized human expertise (like obstetricians) are less affected.

Intuitively they know that something is terribly wrong. But job seekers - the good ones - think it must be them. There is something that they are not doing right. A broken job market simply translates into frustration, hopelessness, and a sense of desperation for our citizens. We can do better. We must do better, especially as we face the pace of change that AI is triggering on a global scale.\n\nGovernments, business leaders, hiring managers, and HR have a role to play in why the market is the way it is.\nAlthough the article provides some interesting insights into how AI can address this problem and fix the broken labor market, I disagree that AI can fix this.\nAI cannot fix greed and stupidity and disregard for our fellow citizens. However, there are strategies and pushbacks that we as a society can do. I will write more about this in my next post.\n\nWhat are your thoughts to address the broken labor market?",

The company is focusing on AI-driven efficiencies in customer service and other operations. with AI. From customer service chatbots to fraud detection, loan approvals, and even marketing automation, AI is now handling tasks that once required human effort. The company plans to further decrease its headcount to around 2,000 employees.\n\nThis isn’t just about cost-cutting—it’s about efficiency. AI is reducing wait times, improving fraud detection, and making smarter, data-driven decisions faster than humans ever could.\n\nBut let’s talk about the elephant in the room. What happens to the people?\n\nWe’ve seen this before—automation replacing factory workers, ATMs replacing bank tellers, and now AI taking over knowledge-based roles. The question isn’t whether AI will take jobs (it already is!) but whether businesses and society will help workers transition to higher-value roles.\n\nIf you feel at risk, here’s what I’d advise:\n\n✅ Develop AI literacy – You don’t have to become a developer, but understanding AI tools relevant to your industry will be a game-changer.\n✅ Upskill in complementary areas – AI needs human oversight, creativity, and strategic thinking. Focus on skills like problem-solving, decision-making, and emotional intelligence.\n✅ Find ways to work with AI, not against it – The most valuable employees will be those who know how to use AI to enhance their work rather than resist it.\n✅ Explore entrepreneurial opportunities – AI is opening new business models. Could you leverage AI to start something of your own?\n✅ Stay adaptable – The job market is shifting fast. Continuous learning is no longer optional; it’s the key to staying relevant.\n\nI see both sides: AI is unlocking new levels of efficiency, but it also challenges how we define work and how we prepare for the future.\n\nWhat’s your take? Are you preparing for AI, or are you still skeptical about its impact?\n\nIf you are interesting to learn more about Coding with AI, I have an upcoming workshop:",

Fully automated AI replacing $100K\/year jobs, unlocking massive value for startups.\n\nBut here’s the paradox: while YC fuels the hype, the reality looks far less promising :\n- AI agents lack counter-positioning. As we know it, disruptive startups succeed by turning incumbents’ strengths into weaknesses—just like Netflix did when it cannibalized Blockbuster’s business model with a frictionless subscription. But AI agents don’t force incumbents into a dilemma since they can integrate these tools effortlessly, leveraging their distribution power and datasets.\n\n- YC is its own nemesis. The very dev tools YC backs are making software absurdly easy to build, allowing companies to create their own AI-powered solutions instead of relying on startups.is already leading this shift, embracing AI to internalize software development and reduce reliance on third-party SaaS.\n\n- The AI pyramid is crumbling. While many believe the AI market is structured as a layered pyramid where application-layer startups can thrive,is proving otherwise. Indeed, new tools like Deep Research help OpenAI escape the commoditization of foundational models, securing its place as a product company controlling user experience, absorbing value that was supposed to flow to application-layer startups, and positioning itself as the dominant interface for AI-powered work.\n\nSo why does YC keep pushing AI agents?\n\nBecause VCs don’t just invest out of conviction—they also invest out of necessity. With billions to deploy, they fund as many startups as possible, knowing most will fail. Being VC-backed doesn’t mean a startup is onto something big—it often just means an investor had no better place to park their money.\n\nBelow is my full take on the topic.

        "text":"The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is often praised for improving efficiency and cutting costs, but its broader economic effects warrant scrutiny.\nThe U.S. tech sector is a cornerstone of the economy, with 1.36 million software developers in 2023 and 284,100 more projected by 2028. High-skill roles, particularly in software and data science, face increasing AI exposure—about one-third of U.S. jobs are at risk.\n\nOffshoring has already reshaped the job market. In 2022, businesses spent over $700 billion on outsourcing, with IT services accounting for $519 billion. By 2024, roughly 300,000 U.S. jobs were offshored annually. Despite high domestic demand, cost pressures continue shifting jobs overseas.\nHistory shows that widespread job displacement isn’t just a worker issue—it ripples through entire economies. The decline of manufacturing hollowed out the Rust Belt, leading to lasting economic decline. Tech once filled the void left by manufacturing, but today, no clear successor exists.\n\nThe immediate cost savings of AI-driven automation and offshoring may come at the expense of long-term economic stability. Without careful planning, the same cycle of job loss and economic decline could repeat.\n\nBalancing innovation and efficiency with economic resilience requires strategic foresight. Companies and policymakers must ensure technological progress benefits the many, not just the few.",

As technology rapidly evolves—especially AI and big data—the job market is also undergoing significant changes.\n\n𝐁𝐢𝐠 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞\n- The rapid growth of fintech, e-commerce, and AI-driven marketing is driving demand for data specialists and digital marketers.\n- Professionals with expertise in big data analytics and digital strategy are increasingly in demand.\n\n𝐀𝐈 𝐢𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠\n- AI-powered tools now automate many tasks, from data analysis to content optimization and personalized advertising.\n- Rather than replacing marketers, this shift requires social media strategists to enhance their analytical and creative skills to stay competitive.\n\n𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬\n- As the working-age population grows, the demand for digital access is increasing.\n- This opens up opportunities for marketers to leverage personalization, automation, and data-driven strategies to improve customer engagement.\n\nBy 2030, industries related to technology and data will continue to expand. AI and information processing technology are expected to create around 11 million new jobs.\n\n𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝐬𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟑𝟎:\n✅ AI & Big Data\n✅ Technological literacy\n✅ Creative thinking\n✅ Lifelong learning\n✅ Talent management\n✅ Systems thinking\n✅ Leadership and influence\n✅ Analytical thinking\n✅ Adaptability and resilience\n✅ Automation and the role of humans in marketing\n\nBy 2030, automation and AI are projected to influence 81.5% of total work output. However, AI will not replace marketers; rather, it will enhance productivity and efficiency. While repetitive and operational tasks may be automated, strategic, creative, and analytical roles will still rely on human expertise.\n\n𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐲 𝐚𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐝?\n- Embrace AI as a tool rather than fearing it.

Marketers who can combine creativity, data-driven decision-making, and technological proficiency will be the leaders of the future.\n\nHere for the full PDF:",

A huge thank you tofor bringing me onboard, and trusting me to help grow our brand and support our clients through their transformations, big and small.\n\nChange is happening faster than ever, and nowhere is that more evident than in the conversations around AI and digital transformation. The big question I hear from leaders isn’t whether to embrace AI, but how to bring their people along for the journey.\n\nSo far, the goal of AI in most organizations isn’t to replace people – it’s to enhance how we work. But for that to happen, we need to understand our workforce:\n\n🔹 Their skill levels & knowledge of AI\n🔹 Their aptitude for adapting to new technology\n🔹 Their motivations for engaging with AI in the workplace\n\nThis is where change management plays a critical role. At, we help organizations bridge the gap between AI adoption and human impact – ensuring teams are empowered, engaged, and ready to maximize the opportunities that AI brings.\n\nIf you're thinking about how to integrate AI into your business, drive digital transformation, or create a culture that embraces change, let’s connect!

It also takes awareness, desire, clear processes, and more to ensure it actually works for people.\n\nWorry and uncertainty happen when change feels out of our control.\n\nThis means organizations need to do more than just implement AI. They need to bring workers into the process, show the value, and provide the right support.\n\nAI shouldn’t be something done to workers. It should be something done with them",

But also, let’s not be deceived, AI will impact customer experience jobs and a significant portion of these jobs will be replaced.  It’s already happening and will continue to happen.\n\nOur focus should be on upskilling employees to work alongside AI, not against it.

A lot of hiring managers are realizing demonstrated ability is a better predictor of job performance.\n\n2. AI is reshaping recruitment. 🤖\n\nAI is screening resumes, sourcing and matching talent, and taking first-round interviews. Companies using AI can potentially make faster, better hires and candidates who know how to work with it will have an advantage. It’s a powerful tool, but it still works best alongside human judgment, not instead of.\n\n3. The global talent war is heating up. 🌍🔥\n\nGlobal talent hubs like Mexico, Poland, and Vietnam are seeing rapid growth. At the same time, high-cost markets (think NYC, London, and SF) are losing top talent to flexible, distributed teams.\n\n4. Increased time-to-hire. ⏳\n\n60% of organizations reported an increase in time-to-hire in 2024, with interview cancellations and rescheduling being the primary bottlenecks. Making AI integration more important to help cut delays and improve efficiency (Remote has some announcements soon to help with this!! 🤖).\n\n5. Passive vs active job seekers. 🕵️♂️\n\n60% of American workers are passive candidates - not actively applying but open to opportunities. Hiring teams relying on inbound applications risk missing top talent.\n\nWhat this means for hiring managers:\n\n✅ Filtering by degree could cost you great talent. Skills-based hiring gives you access to candidates with real-world experience.\n\n✅ Using AI alongside recruiter judgment leads to stronger hiring decisions. It streamlines the process, but human oversight remains key.\n\n✅ Talent is moving beyond traditional hubs. Expanding your search to global talent markets (Mexico, Poland, Vietnam) can give you access to highly skilled candidates at competitive rates.\n\n✅ Top talent isn’t always actively applying.

        "text":"My Take on Today’s Job Market\n\nI’ve done my fair share of hiring and firing. When I ran my company, I didn’t rely on ATS, AI-generated resume scores or trendy hiring gimmicks. I looked for basic but invaluable skills—personality, willingness to learn, and genuine excitement for the position. You can learn more about a person just by sitting across from them and letting them talk than from any keyword-stuffed resume. I was raised on the advice “Listen more than you speak,” and it’s never steered me wrong. Every interview taught me something new.\n\nNow, at 45, college-educated, and with more years of experience than some of these so-called \"career experts\" have been alive, I can’t help but roll my eyes at the latest wave of advice from fresh-faced professionals in their early 30s. Where exactly did they acquire these pearls of wisdom? From AI-driven hiring systems that scan resumes for trendy buzzwords and award points accordingly? Please. Their algorithms are just reflections of their own biases, reinforcing what they already think success should look like.\n\nThe thing is: one day, these same self-proclaimed experts will be 60-something, watching the next generation roll in with their \"superior\" methods, and they’ll be deemed outdated, just like the rest of us. The cycle will repeat, as it always has. And yet, today’s youth, much like every generation before them, believe they’ve cracked the code—that they are the most advanced version of humanity to date.\n\nIf that were true, then someone should explain how these so-called \"advanced\" beings are still producing the same basic byproducts as their ancestors—literally. Next time they’re changing their kid’s diaper, they might want to consider whether that mess is truly evidence of social and cultural evolution. Because if it is, then what does that make the person responsible for cleaning it up?",

Professionals entering the workforce today are on pace to hold twice as many jobs over their careers compared to 15 years ago.\n➡️ AI adoption is expanding the boundaries of roles, enabling productivity, task rotation, and innovation. This is driving demand for adaptive talent — specifically, professionals who combine technical expertise with strong human skills.\n➡️ According to new LinkedIn research, HR professionals list finding candidates with the right technical (51%) and soft (45%) skills as some of the top challenges they face - and nearly two-thirds (63%) say there’s a mismatch between the skills job seekers have and the skills their organisation needs. This insight isn’t surprising given the skills needed for jobs are expected to change 70% by 2030, accelerated by rapid developments in AI.\n\nDive deeper into our full report to read about all the trends we’re seeing in this emerging space and how business leaders, professionals and companies are adapting to prepare for what’s next.",

But when AI started reshaping entire industries overnight, I had to ask myself:\n\n→ What do I bring to the table that AI can’t?\n→ What skills do I need to evolve, not just keep up, but stay ahead?\n→ What does leadership even look like in an AI-powered world?\n\nI say take a step back.\nNot to chase the latest AI trend.\nNot to force-fit a business into the hype.\nBut to rethink the long-term value.\n\nI challenge you to do this. Take a day.\nTurn off the noise.\nStep away from the frantic AI race.\nAnd ask yourself the hard questions:\n→ What unique value do I offer that AI can’t replace?\n→ How will this change what people pay for?\n→ What must I build, not just learn, to stay ahead?\n\nActually map out a vision.\nNot just for next month. For the next year.\nEven a rough long-term roadmap is 5x more valuable than chasing short-term tactics.\n\nNow, let’s get real. what’s one way AI is making you rethink your career?",

Compared to the mid-2022 hiring peak, listings are 3.5 times fewer. Interestingly, while tech hiring has plummeted, overall job postings are up 10% since 2020.\n\nSo, why the sharp decline in tech roles?\n\n•Pandemic hiring boom aftermath: Companies overhired in 2021-2022 and are now adjusting.\n\n•Economic shifts: High interest rates and reduced VC funding have slowed startup hiring.\n\n•AI productivity gains: Tools like GenAI are boosting developer efficiency, potentially reducing immediate hiring needs.\n\nYet, it’s not all gloom. Sectors like construction (+25%) and electrical engineering (+20%) are seeing growth. Plus, startups like Linear and Bluesky are thriving with lean teams.\n\nThe big question: As AI enables non-developers to build software, will this create new opportunities for experienced engineers to refine and scale these solutions?\n\nWhat do you think?

When creativity, emotional intelligence or strategic thinking is needed, humans outperform AI.\n\n2️⃣ Cost & Scalability\n\nWith no large salaries, tax contributions or onboarding costs, there's usually opportunity to scale output more cost effectively using AI, but it comes down to the task. Complex tasks need complex systems which, while scalable, require upfront costs and maintenance.\n\n3️⃣ Technology Integration\n\nImplementing AI requires infrastructure, investment, and training. While integration is getting smoother, there's still a transition period where training and testing is required, so hiring may be simpler and quicker in these instances.\n\n4️⃣ Human Resource Development\n\nThe side many people don't focus on - training employees alongside AI increases job satisfaction. Employees develop new skills and have more time to prioritise their focus.\n\n5️⃣ Ethical and Cultural Considerations\n\nMorale amongst your team is key. Clear communication about AI's role is important to empower staff rather than create uncertainty. Transparency is also required for customer-facing AI integrations.\n\n\nThe best approach?\n\nFocus on hiring for strategic and leadership roles but for others, empower existing teams with AI capabilities rather than just adding to the headcount.\n\nThis way you'll maximise output, manage costs and maintain staff morale.",

I even have my own AI-generated DALL-E pic: I call her AI Lani 😄 and she helps me out with so much! 👏\n\nHere's how AI is elevating my recruiting game:\n✅ Efficiency Boost: AI takes care of time-consuming tasks like resume screening and writing candidate summaries, giving me more time to focus on what truly matters—building genuine relationships.\n✅ Better Insights: With AI-driven analytics, I gain deeper insights into candidate profiles and market trends, helping me make smarter, data-informed decisions.\n✅ Enhanced Candidate Experience: Automating routine communications ensures candidates feel valued and informed at every stage, without me missing a beat.\n✅ Supporting, Not Replacing: AI brings the data and automation, but the human touch—understanding candidate motivations, company culture, and those “intangibles”—that’s still 100% me.\n✅ Engaged Interviews: Tools like Fathom AI take notes during interviews, allowing me to stay fully present, connect meaningfully, and avoid the frantic note-taking.\n\nAnd hey, even Kona and Lili 🐶🐾 love that I use AI—because it means more time to throw the ball for Lili and give Kona treats and belly rubs! 😂\n\nThe best part? AI empowers me to do what I love most: connecting with people, guiding careers, and helping companies find the perfect fit. It’s not about replacing recruiters but enhancing our ability to bring even greater value.\n\nHow are you using AI in your daily work? Do you have an AI \"buddy\"? I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

This imbalance can lead to inefficient hiring practices that ultimately hurt both employers and candidates.\n\n-The HR Conundrum\nHR professionals are crucial in developing effective recruitment strategies. However, when HR teams lack the necessary training or experience, they may struggle to define roles with precision. This ambiguity results in:\nProlonged hiring cycles\nMisaligned candidate selections\n-Increased turnover rates\nResearch indicates that an overdependence on AI in hiring can cause companies to miss out on top talent—potentially costing up to $840,000 over two years due to poor hiring decisions.\n\n-The Risks of Overdependence on ATS and AI\nWhile technology can streamline recruitment, relying too heavily on these tools presents risks:\nLoss of Human Judgment: AI may fail to evaluate soft skills, cultural fit, or potential—key ingredients for building a strong team.\nBias and Discrimination: AI systems trained on biased data can inadvertently reinforce existing prejudices, resulting in unfair hiring practices.\nAlienation of Top Talent: Candidates often feel discouraged by impersonal, automated processes, with surveys revealing that 38% would reject offers from companies that rely heavily on AI.\n-Impact on Candidate Well-Being\nAmbiguous job requirements not only waste candidates’ time but also contribute to mental distress:\nIncreased Stress and Anxiety: Unclear roles can leave candidates uncertain about their fit, heightening stress during the application process.\nEmotional Exhaustion: Extended ambiguity forces candidates to invest extra effort into deciphering vague expectations, which can lead to burnout.\nDecreased Self-Efficacy: Repeated exposure to unclear job roles can erode candidates’ confidence in their abilities.\n-Recommendations for Employers\nTo foster a more effective and humane recruitment process, consider these strategies:\nInvest in HR Training: Ensure HR teams are equipped to define clear job requirements and engage meaningfully with candidates.\nBalance Technology with Human Insight: Use AI for administrative tasks, but rely on human judgment for evaluating soft skills and cultural fit.\nRegularly Audit AI Tools: Monitor and adjust AI systems to minimize bias and ensure fair hiring practices.\nEnhance the Candidate Experience: Maintain transparent communication and provide personalized interactions to attract and retain top talent.\nBy addressing these challenges and adopting a balanced approach, companies can not only improve hiring outcomes but also create a more engaged and resilient workforce.\nWhat are your thoughts on balancing technology with human insight in recruitment?",

In 2023 alone, companies across industries reported a 30% increase in productivity by integrating automation technologies.\n\nBut here’s the other side: For many professionals, this shift has triggered anxiety about job security. After all, if AI can write code, generate reports, or analyze data, where does that leave the human workforce?\n\nBreaking Down the Trend: What’s Really Happening?\n\nThe reality is more complex. While AI is eliminating repetitive, low-value tasks, it’s also opening up new roles and opportunities in areas like:\nAI Implementation – Companies need specialists to integrate and maintain AI solutions.\n\nData Interpretation – Humans are still essential to contextualize and apply AI-driven insights.\nCreative Problem-Solving – Innovation requires human ingenuity, something AI has yet to master.\n\nA recent study by McKinsey found that 60% of jobs will require hybrid skills—technical knowledge paired with creativity, communication, and critical thinking. The winners in this new landscape will be those who adapt quickly, upskilling to stay ahead of these trends.\n\nHow Companies Are Responding\n\nLeading organizations are approaching the AI shift strategically:\n🔍 Upskilling programs – Investing in employee development to match evolving tech demands.\n🔍 AI collaboration – Viewing AI as a tool to enhance productivity, not replace workers.\n🔍 New job creation – Roles like AI trainers, automation analysts, and data strategists are becoming crucial.\n\nWhat This Means for You\n\nWhether you're an entrepreneur, manager, or employee, staying on top of industry trends is non-negotiable. Success will belong to those who continually learn, pivot, and embrace innovation.\n\n💡 How do you see AI and automation impacting your role or industry?\n\n👉 Drop your thoughts in the comments!

Over 70 million workers are \"Skilled Through Alternative Routes\" (STARs). Are we overlooking them?\n✅ AI broadens the talent pool: AI helps match candidates with the right skills, even if they don’t fit the “traditional mold.”\n✅ Diverse teams = better outcomes: Hiring for skills leads to more innovative, productive, and resilient teams.\n\nAs a Bench sales recruiter, I’ve seen firsthand how focusing on skills over credentials can uncover hidden gems.

AI won’t be able to process candidate data.\n\nYour competitors are already using AI—are you?\n\n📌 Companies leveraging AI in recruitment are filling roles faster, reducing costs, and improving candidate quality.\n📌 Those who don’t will be left behind, struggling with slow, outdated processes.\n\nThe future of hiring is already here.

Unlike traditional resumes, which often blend together due to AI-assisted tailoring, video resumes offer:\n\n- Authenticity: Hiring managers get to see your communication skills, enthusiasm, and personality firsthand.\n- Differentiation: Instead of relying on keyword-stuffed documents, candidates can showcase their real strengths in a more engaging format.\n- Soft skills assessment: For roles requiring leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving, a well-crafted video can say more than a thousand words on paper.\n\nWhile AI has made resume building more efficient, it has also led to uniformity.

A lot of hiring managers are realizing demonstrated ability is a better predictor of job performance.\n\n2. AI is reshaping recruitment. 🤖\n\nAI is screening resumes, sourcing and matching talent, and taking first-round interviews. Companies using AI can potentially make faster, better hires and candidates who know how to work with it will have an advantage. It’s a powerful tool, but it still works best alongside human judgment, not instead of.\n\n3. The global talent war is heating up. 🌍🔥\n\nGlobal talent hubs like Mexico, Poland, and Vietnam are seeing rapid growth. At the same time, high-cost markets (think NYC, London, and SF) are losing top talent to flexible, distributed teams.\n\n4. Increased time-to-hire. ⏳\n\n60% of organizations reported an increase in time-to-hire in 2024, with interview cancellations and rescheduling being the primary bottlenecks. Making AI integration more important to help cut delays and improve efficiency (Remote has some announcements soon to help with this!! 🤖).\n\n5. Passive vs active job seekers. 🕵️♂️\n\n60% of American workers are passive candidates - not actively applying but open to opportunities. Hiring teams relying on inbound applications risk missing top talent.\n\nWhat this means for hiring managers:\n\n✅ Filtering by degree could cost you great talent. Skills-based hiring gives you access to candidates with real-world experience.\n\n✅ Using AI alongside recruiter judgment leads to stronger hiring decisions. It streamlines the process, but human oversight remains key.\n\n✅ Talent is moving beyond traditional hubs. Expanding your search to global talent markets (Mexico, Poland, Vietnam) can give you access to highly skilled candidates at competitive rates.\n\n✅ Top talent isn’t always actively applying. Proactive sourcing is still important, and with 800M+ candidate profiles, Remote Recruit can help you find the best fit.\n\nMore data and exciting announcements coming soon!\n\nSources: Forbes, Payscale 2024 Compensation Best Practices Report, Good Time 2025 Hiring Statistics, Jobvite, Harvard Business Review, LinkedIn 2024 Workplace Report & SHRM AI Hiring Trends, World Economic Forum, LinkedIn Workforce Report & NPR’s labor market studies.\n\nRemote 💜",

Mid-level (40%) and entry-level (37%) gigs are in the hot seat, per the AI-Enabled ICT Consortium.\n\n• New Jobs Alert: The World Economic Forum predicts a net gain of 78M jobs globally (170M created vs. 92M lost). Think AI ethics, rapid engineering, cybersecurity—IT’s future is bright!\n\n• Hours Impact: McKinsey says 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated. But creativity and complex problem-solving? Still human territory.\n\n• Upskill or Bust: AI can write code, but it can’t dream up systems or fix quirky bugs. Learn AI tools, data strategy, or governance to stay ahead.\n\nThe IT sector’s both the lab and the experiment—disruption’s real, but the opportunity’s massive. How are you gearing up?

        "text":"My Take on Today’s Job Market\n\nI’ve done my fair share of hiring and firing. When I ran my company, I didn’t rely on ATS, AI-generated resume scores or trendy hiring gimmicks. I looked for basic but invaluable skills—personality, willingness to learn, and genuine excitement for the position. You can learn more about a person just by sitting across from them and letting them talk than from any keyword-stuffed resume. I was raised on the advice “Listen more than you speak,” and it’s never steered me wrong. Every interview taught me something new.\n\nNow, at 45, college-educated, and with more years of experience than some of these so-called \"career experts\" have been alive, I can’t help but roll my eyes at the latest wave of advice from fresh-faced professionals in their early 30s. Where exactly did they acquire these pearls of wisdom? From AI-driven hiring systems that scan resumes for trendy buzzwords and award points accordingly? Please. Their algorithms are just reflections of their own biases, reinforcing what they already think success should look like.\n\nThe thing is: one day, these same self-proclaimed experts will be 60-something, watching the next generation roll in with their \"superior\" methods, and they’ll be deemed outdated, just like the rest of us. The cycle will repeat, as it always has. And yet, today’s youth, much like every generation before them, believe they’ve cracked the code—that they are the most advanced version of humanity to date.\n\nIf that were true, then someone should explain how these so-called \"advanced\" beings are still producing the same basic byproducts as their ancestors—literally. Next time they’re changing their kid’s diaper, they might want to consider whether that mess is truly evidence of social and cultural evolution. Because if it is, then what does that make the person responsible for cleaning it up?",

This is driving demand for adaptive talent — specifically, professionals who combine technical expertise with strong human skills.\n➡️ According to new LinkedIn research, HR professionals list finding candidates with the right technical (51%) and soft (45%) skills as some of the top challenges they face - and nearly two-thirds (63%) say there’s a mismatch between the skills job seekers have and the skills their organisation needs. This insight isn’t surprising given the skills needed for jobs are expected to change 70% by 2030, accelerated by rapid developments in AI.\n\nDive deeper into our full report to read about all the trends we’re seeing in this emerging space and how business leaders, professionals and companies are adapting to prepare for what’s next.",

Traditional hiring methods, which often rely on resumes and interviews, are being enhanced by AI-driven tools that promises greater efficiency, accuracy, and fairness.\n\n🔍 AI-Powered Talent Assessment: What’s Changing?\n\n✅ Data-Driven Hiring Decisions – AI analyzes vast amounts of candidate data to identify skills, competencies, and potential, reducing bias and improving hiring accuracy.\n\n✅ Smart Screening & Matching – AI-powered applicant tracking systems (ATS) can scan resumes, match candidates to job descriptions, and rank them based on suitability—saving recruiters countless hours.\n\n✅ Predictive Analytics – AI can assess not just current skills but also a candidate’s ability to learn, adapt, and succeed in a role over time.\n\n✅ Gamification & AI Assessments – Companies are leveraging AI-driven assessments, including cognitive ability tests and gamified evaluations, to measure problem-solving skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit.\n\n✅ Bias Reduction – AI can help mitigate unconscious bias in hiring by focusing on skills and performance indicators rather than subjective factors like name, gender, or background.\n\n🚀 What’s Next?\nAs AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more advanced talent assessment tools, including AI-driven video interviews that analyze speech patterns, facial expressions, and behavioral traits. While AI enhances efficiency, organizations must ensure ethical and fair use to avoid unintended biases.\n\nHow is your company leveraging AI in talent assessment? Let’s discuss in the comments! 👇",

Plus, startups like Linear and Bluesky are thriving with lean teams.\n\nThe big question: As AI enables non-developers to build software, will this create new opportunities for experienced engineers to refine and scale these solutions?\n\nWhat do you think?

        "text":"AI vs Hiring - What's Best for Your Business? \n\nA question now on the cards for all businesses looking to scale is - automate with AI or hire human talent?\n\nHere are 5 key points to consider:\n\n1️⃣ Understanding the Task\n\nAI thrives on more rule-based logical tasks, boosting efficiency while reducing human error. When creativity, emotional intelligence or strategic thinking is needed, humans outperform AI.\n\n2️⃣ Cost & Scalability\n\nWith no large salaries, tax contributions or onboarding costs, there's usually opportunity to scale output more cost effectively using AI, but it comes down to the task. Complex tasks need complex systems which, while scalable, require upfront costs and maintenance.\n\n3️⃣ Technology Integration\n\nImplementing AI requires infrastructure, investment, and training. While integration is getting smoother, there's still a transition period where training and testing is required, so hiring may be simpler and quicker in these instances.\n\n4️⃣ Human Resource Development\n\nThe side many people don't focus on - training employees alongside AI increases job satisfaction. Employees develop new skills and have more time to prioritise their focus.\n\n5️⃣ Ethical and Cultural Considerations\n\nMorale amongst your team is key. Clear communication about AI's role is important to empower staff rather than create uncertainty. Transparency is also required for customer-facing AI integrations.\n\n\nThe best approach?\n\nFocus on hiring for strategic and leadership roles but for others, empower existing teams with AI capabilities rather than just adding to the headcount.\n\nThis way you'll maximise output, manage costs and maintain staff morale.",

AI tools can be a great starting point. They help with formatting, ATS optimization, and save time. But when candidates don’t take the time to proofread or customize their resumes, recruiters immediately notice. A generic, AI-generated resume won’t set you apart, it will blend in.\n\nAnother misstep? Trying to “hack” ATS systems with tactics like white ink keyword stuffing. Not only does this not work (since modern ATS software reformats the text), but it risks making your resume unreadable if a human reviewer does see it.\n\nAt the end of the day, your resume’s goal isn’t just to get past software.

But let me tell you, from firsthand experience: AI isn’t taking over my role—it’s making me more productive, effective, and yes, even more human!\n\nAs a recruiter with over 20 years of experience, I've seen tools and trends come and go. But AI? It’s a true game-changer. I even have my own AI-generated DALL-E pic: I call her AI Lani 😄 and she helps me out with so much! 👏\n\nHere's how AI is elevating my recruiting game:\n✅ Efficiency Boost: AI takes care of time-consuming tasks like resume screening and writing candidate summaries, giving me more time to focus on what truly matters—building genuine relationships.\n✅ Better Insights: With AI-driven analytics, I gain deeper insights into candidate profiles and market trends, helping me make smarter, data-informed decisions.\n✅ Enhanced Candidate Experience: Automating routine communications ensures candidates feel valued and informed at every stage, without me missing a beat.\n✅ Supporting, Not Replacing: AI brings the data and automation, but the human touch—understanding candidate motivations, company culture, and those “intangibles”—that’s still 100% me.\n✅ Engaged Interviews: Tools like Fathom AI take notes during interviews, allowing me to stay fully present, connect meaningfully, and avoid the frantic note-taking.\n\nAnd hey, even Kona and Lili 🐶🐾 love that I use AI—because it means more time to throw the ball for Lili and give Kona treats and belly rubs! 😂\n\nThe best part? AI empowers me to do what I love most: connecting with people, guiding careers, and helping companies find the perfect fit. It’s not about replacing recruiters but enhancing our ability to bring even greater value.\n\nHow are you using AI in your daily work? Do you have an AI \"buddy\"? I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

This imbalance can lead to inefficient hiring practices that ultimately hurt both employers and candidates.\n\n-The HR Conundrum\nHR professionals are crucial in developing effective recruitment strategies. However, when HR teams lack the necessary training or experience, they may struggle to define roles with precision.

In 2023 alone, companies across industries reported a 30% increase in productivity by integrating automation technologies.\n\nBut here’s the other side: For many professionals, this shift has triggered anxiety about job security. After all, if AI can write code, generate reports, or analyze data, where does that leave the human workforce?\n\nBreaking Down the Trend: What’s Really Happening?\n\nThe reality is more complex. While AI is eliminating repetitive, low-value tasks, it’s also opening up new roles and opportunities in areas like:\nAI Implementation – Companies need specialists to integrate and maintain AI solutions.\n\nData Interpretation – Humans are still essential to contextualize and apply AI-driven insights.\nCreative Problem-Solving – Innovation requires human ingenuity, something AI has yet to master.\n\nA recent study by McKinsey found that 60% of jobs will require hybrid skills—technical knowledge paired with creativity, communication, and critical thinking. The winners in this new landscape will be those who adapt quickly, upskilling to stay ahead of these trends.\n\nHow Companies Are Responding\n\nLeading organizations are approaching the AI shift strategically:\n🔍 Upskilling programs – Investing in employee development to match evolving tech demands.\n🔍 AI collaboration – Viewing AI as a tool to enhance productivity, not replace workers.\n🔍 New job creation – Roles like AI trainers, automation analysts, and data strategists are becoming crucial.\n\nWhat This Means for You\n\nWhether you're an entrepreneur, manager, or employee, staying on top of industry trends is non-negotiable. Success will belong to those who continually learn, pivot, and embrace innovation.\n\n💡 How do you see AI and automation impacting your role or industry?\n\n👉 Drop your thoughts in the comments!

If your recruitment process is still relying on manual job postings, traditional sourcing, and human-only decision-making, you’re already losing the hiring race to competitors who are leveraging AI-driven recruitment.\n\nWhy AI is a game-changer in hiring\n\n🚀 AI-generated job & assignment descriptions – No more manually writing job ads; AI analyzes market trends and auto-generates tailored descriptions.\n🚀 Faster, smarter talent acquisition – AI instantly scans, filters, and ranks candidates based on skills, experience, and behavioral patterns.\n🚀 Automated talent pool management – AI keeps track of availability, skills, and career progression, so the best candidates are always within reach.\n🚀 AI-personalized communication – Integrating with tools like Crystal Knows, AI identifies personality types (DISC model) and adjusts communication style to maximize engagement.\n🚀 Instant search & matching based on data – AI doesn’t rely on guesswork; it analyzes structured data to find the perfect fit faster than any recruiter ever could.\n\nBut here’s the problem: bad data = bad AI = bad hiring\n\n❌ Outdated, unstructured ATS & CRM systems lead to inaccurate matches.\n❌ No GDPR compliance? AI won’t be able to process candidate data.\n\nYour competitors are already using AI—are you?\n\n📌 Companies leveraging AI in recruitment are filling roles faster, reducing costs, and improving candidate quality.\n📌 Those who don’t will be left behind, struggling with slow, outdated processes.\n\nThe future of hiring is already here. If your company isn’t integrating AI into recruitment, you’re not just behind; you’re actively losing top talent to competitors who are.\n\nCurious, how are you ñeveraging AI in recruitment?",

The analysis highlights that well-educated professionals in major metros like San Francisco, San Jose, Washington, D.C., and New York could see significant changes in their work as AI takes on more cognitive tasks such as coding, research, and content creation. While this technology could boost productivity in some instances, it also brings the risk of job displacement—a twist from previous automation trends that mostly impacted blue-collar and rural jobs.

Read on for his advice!\n\n🎤 Can you tell us about your journey at Amazon and what led you to your current role as a recruiter for Amazon AGI?\nOver 3 years ago, I was tapped on the shoulder by an old Recruiting Manager to join and support the recruiting efforts to build out Alexa AI. Fast forward to 2025, I now support Amazon AGI, the team creating state-of-the-art foundation models that deliver frontier intelligence and industry leading price-performance on Amazon Bedrock.\n\n🎤 What types of roles is AGI hiring for?\nThere’s a lot of unique opportunities here at Amazon.

Whether it's jumping on info-calls with passive candidates or joint-sourcing sessions, our AGI leaders take a vested interest in our efforts to scale up and build out our talent pools.\n\n---\n\nJoin our team and build the future with the Amazon AGI team. 🤖🚀",

It’s about proactively targeting the right candidates before you even need them.\n\nHere’s how top companies are doing it:\n\n1: Define Your “Ideal Candidate” with Precision\n\nGeneric job descriptions attract generic candidates. The best companies know exactly who they’re looking for.\n\n🟢 Example:doesn’t just hire “software engineers.” They target candidates with specific skills, like machine learning expertise or experience in scalable systems. This precision reduces misfires and speeds up hiring.\n\n2: Build Relationships, Not Just Pipelines\n\nTalent pipelines aren’t just databases—they’re networks. Companies like HubSpot engage with candidates long before they have open roles.\n\n🟢 Example:’s recruiters regularly share valuable content and interact with potential candidates on LinkedIn. When a role opens, they already have a pool of engaged, interested professionals ready to go.\n\n3: Use Data to Predict Talent Trends\n\nData-driven companies don’t guess—they analyze. They track where their top performers come from and what skills they bring.\n\n🟢 Example:uses data to identify the traits of their most successful employees. They then target candidates who match those traits, resulting in higher retention and performance.\n\n4: Automate the Grunt Work\n\nManual sourcing is a time-suck. Smart companies use tools to automate repetitive tasks.\n\n🟢 Example:uses AI-powered platforms like Pymetrics to screen candidates and assess their fit. This reduced their hiring time by 75% and improved candidate quality.\n\n5: Think Long-Term, Not Reactive\n\nThe best pipelines are built over time, not during a hiring crunch. Companies like Amazon focus on nurturing passive candidates.\n\n🟢 Example:maintains a pipeline of thousands of passive candidates. When it needs to scale, it can fill roles in weeks, not months.\n\nInstead of scrambling to fill roles, companies with strategic pipelines have a pool of pre-qualified, engaged candidates ready to go.\n\nThis means spending less time sifting through resumes and more time focusing on strategic priorities, such as growing the business or improving team culture.\n\nWhat’s the biggest challenge your company faces when building a talent pipeline?\nLet’s chat about solutions together! 👇",

Faster, more efficient, and data-driven hiring decisions. But the big question remains: Can AI truly understand human potential?\n\nMany organizations are adopting AI-powered recruitment tools to eliminate human bias, streamline processes, and improve candidate matching. However, critics argue that AI might be reinforcing biases instead of removing them. After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.\nThe Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring\n\n✅ Why AI is a Game-Changer:\n✔ Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.\n✔ Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.\n✔ Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.\n\n⚠ Concerns About AI in Recruitment:\n❌ Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.\n❌ Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?\n❌ Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.\nWith technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?\n\n💬 We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Reports from policymakers and industry leaders celebrate the promise of reskilling, insisting that workers will seamlessly transition into new careers.\n\nBut history tells a different story. Disruption is not neutral. Entire industries have crumbled under automation, leaving behind workers who lacked the time, resources, or opportunities to pivot. The numbers on AI-driven job creation often ignore the cost of transition—the financial strain, the gaps in retraining, and the reality that new roles rarely emerge where old ones disappear.\n\nThis is why education cannot take a backseat in the AI conversation. Unlike industries chasing short-term efficiency, education’s mandate is long-term: to preserve dignity, foster resilience, and ensure people are not left behind.\nIn my latest article, I explore:\n\n✅ Why the standard reskilling narrative is inadequate\n✅ How Further Education colleges are leading AI adoption responsibly\n✅ What businesses must learn from education before making costly AI missteps\n\nAI is reshaping the workforce. But without strategic intervention, it won’t be a net positive—it will be a net upheaval.\n\nRead the full article below.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts—how can education and industry work together to ensure AI creates real opportunities, not just optimistic headlines?",

Hear me out.\n\nA few observations:\n\n🔸We're experiencing a \"white-collar recession\" where knowledge workers are experiencing long-term unemployment--some stretching up to a year+.\n\n🔸The fed cuts are throwing gov workers into the market, some targeting sectors where their legacy software or irrelevant processes don't match up to today's market demand. While capable, their toolsets may not be as marketable as current tech.\n\n🔸And, of course, AI. What's the new saying? You won't be replaced by AI, but those who leverage AI will outpace those who don't. Particularly for knowledge workers--marketers, engineers, analysts--the pressure to stay fresh on adopting these tools is here.\n\nWhere are we with solutions?\n\n🔹Employers become more flexible, giving ample time and resources for training. \"Hire for potential.\"\n\n🔹Professionals take on the initiative of reskilling to stay competitive with market demand.\n\nVirginia and Maryland governors are attempting to create pathways for displaced workers. Wes Moore announced last week that there are over 1600 teaching jobs available in Maryland--a pathway for a second career.\n\nHere's my question: will these displaced fed workers embrace teaching as a second career? Are the 250k jobs posted on the Virginiahasjobs site aligned with the skill sets of the displaced workers?\n\nSomething has to give here-- The workforce is at an inflection point. What's your take?",

High-skill roles, particularly in software and data science, face increasing AI exposure—about one-third of U.S. jobs are at risk.\n\nOffshoring has already reshaped the job market. In 2022, businesses spent over $700 billion on outsourcing, with IT services accounting for $519 billion. By 2024, roughly 300,000 U.S. jobs were offshored annually. Despite high domestic demand, cost pressures continue shifting jobs overseas.\nHistory shows that widespread job displacement isn’t just a worker issue—it ripples through entire economies. The decline of manufacturing hollowed out the Rust Belt, leading to lasting economic decline. Tech once filled the void left by manufacturing, but today, no clear successor exists.\n\nThe immediate cost savings of AI-driven automation and offshoring may come at the expense of long-term economic stability. Without careful planning, the same cycle of job loss and economic decline could repeat.\n\nBalancing innovation and efficiency with economic resilience requires strategic foresight.

This readily available information bypasses the mental effort required for independent problem-solving. We become passive recipients of information rather than active seekers of knowledge.\n\n2\/ Diminished Critical Thinking Skills\nOver-reliance on AI's outputs reduces the need to verify information, question assumptions, or consider alternative perspectives. This constant reliance on AI can atrophy our critical thinking muscles, leading to a decline in our ability to independently evaluate information and form our own conclusions.\n\n3\/ Erosion of Curiosity and Questioning\nThe ease of obtaining answers from AI can stifle our natural curiosity and the desire to explore complex issues. Instead of formulating our own questions and seeking answers through investigation, we become content with accepting AI's output without deeper inquiry.\n\n4\/ Overdependence and Skill Degradation\nConsistent use of AI for tasks that previously required independent thought can lead to a decline in problem-solving skills and independent thinking. We become overly dependent on the tool, losing the ability to tackle challenges without AI's assistance.\n\n5\/ Ethical Judgment Bypass\nAlthough AI can process data, it lacks the ethical judgment and contextual understanding that humans possess. Relying solely on AI's output for complex decisions can lead to overlooking ethical considerations or unintended consequences, as AI operates without a moral compass.\n\n⤵️ The future of critical thinking in the age of AI depends on us.\n\nWill we allow convenience to dull our minds, or will we harness AI’s potential to sharpen them?",

Here’s the first takeaway:\nJob changes\n💡 AI will drive both job growth and automation – AI and Machine Learning Specialists, Data Analysts, and Cybersecurity Experts are among the fastest-growing roles (p. 19).\n💡 Clerical and administrative roles are in decline – Administrative assistants, bookkeeping clerks, and factory workers are among the jobs most at risk due to automation (p. 19).\n💡 Demographic shifts will reshape job demand – Aging populations are driving demand for healthcare workers, teachers, and vocational professionals (p. 15).\n\nAccording to the report, nearly 40% of skills required on the job are expected to change, and 63% of employers identify the skills gap as a primary barrier to business transformation.\n\nAdditionally, the report projects that 59% of the global workforce will require reskilling or upskilling by 2030, with 11% unlikely to receive it, translating to over 120 million workers at medium-term risk of redundancy.\n\nMore to come—stay tuned!

Your agency's capabilities & readiness to quickly pivot to meet reskilling & upskilling demands directed through the President's Management Agenda, Executive Actions, and other top-down mandates will be critical to your success as a learning leader, and to the success of the employees who depend on your team to provide them with the training needed to competently perform their jobs.\n\n2. You should expect and be prepared for a surge in AI, Cybersecurity, Data\/Analytics and other workforce modernization mandates. Given the unprecedented pace and rigor of execution demanded by the administration, you and the employees you serve will be faced with reskilling\/upskilling requirements that must be met within a matter of days or weeks — not months or years. Therefore, it's imperative that you be prepared to meet a wide range of talent development needs at any time across a broad set of technology, business, leadership, safety, and federal legal areas.\n\n3. Get your learning technology right. Simplicity & beauty are key. Jettison your cumbersome, disjointed, costly legacy learning management systems right now. Lean in to a modern, frictionless, FedRAMP-authorized enterprise learning experience platform that's purpose-built to elevate human performance. It must employ safe AI, offer multi-modal digital content & blended virtual ILT capabilities, AI-generated role-based learning paths, and it must enable you to assess and index skill proficiency so that your agency knows at any given moment where its skill strengths and gaps exist - you're going to be asked about this every day.\n\n4. You will be constantly measured against uncomfortable metrics, so mitigate risk and increase your probability for success by sole sourcing with an experienced, trusted partner with a long and strong track record. Don't overlook quality of the provider's Customer Success team - you're going to need the help of experienced professionals who know what they're doing. This strategy will yield successful economical, efficient, and effective outcomes.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

It’s rethinking work so AI and human potential thrive together.\n\n💡 How is your company preparing its workforce for these AI shifts?

As AI technologies advance, businesses optimize operations and enhance competitiveness, yet concerns about job displacement in routine tasks persist. The shift emphasizes roles requiring creativity and critical thinking, highlighting a growing demand for AI-related skills, which educational institutions must address. AI's economic impact also risks widening inequality, favoring resource-rich organizations, but it holds potential for economic inclusion by empowering startups.
