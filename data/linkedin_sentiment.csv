"The Job Market Is a Mess—But My Friend Found a Loophole

AI is replacing jobs.
AI is writing resumes.
AI is rejecting candidates before a human ever sees them.

At the same time, job seekers are flooding applications with AI-generated resumes just to get noticed.

Hiring managers? They’re drowning in a sea of polished but misleading applications—and turning to AI to weed them out.

So now, AI is fighting AI.

And the real, qualified candidates are getting lost in the noise.

But my friend Josh Rosenberg pulled off something brilliant.

He found a loophole—a way to skip the AI gatekeepers and go directly to decision-makers.

And it’s working.

"AI in Hiring: Is It Fair or Flawed? 🤖

AI is revolutionizing recruitment—from scanning resumes and shortlisting candidates to even conducting initial interviews. The promise? Faster, more efficient, and data-driven hiring decisions. But the big question remains: Can AI truly understand human potential?

Many organizations are adopting AI-powered recruitment tools to eliminate human bias, streamline processes, and improve candidate matching. However, critics argue that AI might be reinforcing biases instead of removing them. After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.
The Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring

✅ Why AI is a Game-Changer:
✔ Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.
✔ Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.
✔ Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.

⚠ Concerns About AI in Recruitment:
❌ Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.
❌ Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?
❌ Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.
With technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?

A friend recently came to me seeking feedback after submitting countless job applications with no luck. When I saw their ""fandangle"" resume —full of text boxes, graphics, and elaborate designs—it wasn’t hard to see why a highly qualified candidate wasn’t getting the responses they expected. 😬

In today’s job market, where AI and applicant tracking systems (ATS) play a major role in recruitment, many applicants don’t realise that ornate fonts, text boxes, and graphics might actually be working against them. If your resume isn’t formatted for AI, it could be automatically filtered out before a recruiter even sees it!

"🚨 Beware of Bogus Hiring Practices in the Tech Industry! 🚨

The job market is evolving, but unfortunately, not always in a fair way. Recently, I encountered a weird hiring trend that raises serious ethical concerns.

I appeared for an interview with a company, only to later realize that a third-party AI analytics company was also present, silently observing my performance. After the interview, instead of hearing back from the employer, I received an email from this third-party company—analyzing my performance and offering me another interview.

This made me question:
🔹 Was my interview data shared without my consent?
🔹 Did the hiring company get paid for ‘selling’ my interview performance?
🔹 Was there ever a real job vacancy, or was this just a data-harvesting scheme?

It seems like a new form of bogus hiring, where companies conduct interviews not to hire, but to sell candidates’ data to third-party AI firms—monetizing our efforts without any accountability. No feedback, no job offer, just data exploitation.

💡 To all job seekers: Be cautious. If something feels off about a hiring process, trust your instincts. Always research the company and question suspicious practices.

💬 To recruiters and companies: Candidates put in immense effort to prepare for interviews. Playing with their hopes and careers is unethical and unacceptable. Hiring should be about talent acquisition, not data monetization.

The rise of artificial intelligence in recruitment is being hailed as a game-changer, promising faster hiring, reducing bias, and data-driven decision-making.

"If you’re over 40, you have an advantage when job searching (you just don't know it)

Here’s why...

Older job seekers often feel at a disadvantage… but you’re actually in a strong position.

You grew up in a time when job searching meant:

📞 Picking up the phone
🤝 Building real connections
🚪 Walking into companies and making things happen

These 'old-school' skills are exactly what’s missing in today’s market.

So while everyone relies on job boards, AI and 'easy apply' you can outshine them by doing the same things you did before the market changed.

"Lately I've heard top AI companies offering seven-figure packages for specialized talent from San Francisco to Singapore 🤯

🇺🇲 U.S. reports confirm this: AI roles saw 10.4% wage growth in 2024 (3x national average) according to Veritone, with AI freelancers earning 21-40% more than peers per Oxford Institute research.

🌎 We validated this with Deel's global data spanning 150+ countries across full-time and contract roles. Turns out, these trends are even more pronounced globally:

- Contracts with ""AI"" in job titles surged 585% from 2023 to 2024
- We've processed more AI-related contracts in 2025 than in all of 2023
- AI Engineers saw a 340% increase in contracts, while senior AI leadership roles tripled
- The median AI salary is 120% higher than all other roles – up 6% YoY

What's the impact? In the short-term: a widening pay gap between AI and traditional tech positions. But in the long-term: I see three major shifts coming:
📈 1 - Rising compensation across tech roles as market adjustments ripple out
💰 2 - Premium salaries for professionals combining AI with domain expertise (finance, healthcare, etc)
🌐 3 - Innovation hubs diversifying globally beyond traditional tech centers

The AI talent wars will rewrite the global playbook for how technical talent is valued everywhere.

"AI vs AI in Hiring: A Double-Edged Sword 🤖⚔️

With AI tools like ChatGPT helping candidates craft optimized resumes and AI-driven Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) screening them, we are now seeing an interesting ""AI vs AI"" dynamic.

While AI-generated resumes can increase visibility and pass ATS filters, they risk becoming overly polished and generic.

The real challenge? AI-driven screening might prioritize keywords over actual skills and experience, potentially overlooking exceptional candidates.

💡 For Job Seekers: Use AI as a tool, but ensure your resume reflects your true expertise.

💡 For Employers: Balance AI screening with human judgment to evaluate skills, achievements, and cultural fit.

💡 For AI Developers: Evolve AI beyond keyword matching to assess true potential.

"Another day, another round of Big Tech layoffs - this time, Google’s cloud division. But let’s call this what it is: a *reshuffling of talent at the expense of workers.* 

Google is investing billions into AI, yet cutting staff in a growth sector. If cloud is the future, why the cuts? Because AI isn't here to ""augment"" jobs - it’s automating them faster than we admit.

Tech professionals used to believe that AI and cloud jobs were safe. Today’s news proves otherwise. The biggest companies are cutting ""underperformers"" and replacing them with AI and cheaper labor.

This isn’t a reorg. This isn’t ""business as usual."" This is a wake-up call.

"Navigating the Dual Impact of Generative AI on Employment

Generative AI stands at a crossroads, poised to redefine the job markets by simultaneously threatening job displacement whilst creating new opportunities.

On one hand, Goldman Sachs forecasts that AI could automate up to 300 million full-time jobs across the US and Europe, particularly in sectors reliant on routine, repetitive tasks.

This presents a stark shift, with professions like writing, photography, and software development facing high automation risks. Conversely, as Ai automates 29.5% of current work hours by 2030, the potential for new job creation remains substantial.

The World Economic Forum anticipates 97 million new roles emerging by 2025, partially offsetting the 85 million jobs that could be displaced, emphasising a need for workforce transformation.

Crucially, this transition underscores the importance of upskilling, emphasising human skills such as creativity and collaboration, which remain irreplaceable by AI.

"AI and the Death of Traditional Hiring: Will Resumes Become Obsolete?

For years, hiring has relied on:
❌ Resumes & Degrees – Static documents that don’t measure real skills.
❌ Interviews – Biased, time-consuming, and often inaccurate.

🚀 AI is changing the game:
✅ AI Skill Assessments – Algorithms that test real-world problem-solving, not just credentials.
✅ Predictive Hiring – AI analyzes behavioral patterns to match candidates with the best roles.
✅ Autonomous Recruitment Agents – AI bots conducting interviews, scoring applicants, and making offers.

This sentiment was echoed by, an AI Engineer at AISG, who shared that many of his AIAP classmates were mid-career professionals with no prior tech experience — yet they excelled in the programme and successfully transitioned into AI roles.

✅ Upskill professionals for the evolving job market
✅ Support those keen to enter the AI field

"AI, Job Cuts, and Singapore’s Economic Future – What’s Next?

The wave of job cuts driven by Artificial Intelligence has already begun, starting with Banking, Finance, and Insurance—industries that heavily rely on white-collar workers. As AI-driven automation becomes more sophisticated, more sectors will follow.

If the US faces a recession in 2025, it will ""Turbocharge"" global job cuts, particularly in economies that are deeply connected to US trade, including Singapore. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) projects Singapore’s economic growth to be between 1% and 3%—a low growth scenario combined with a US downturn would likely have a significant impact on our job market.

At the same time, many retrenched workers will turn to SkillsFuture to upskill in AI-related fields. Ironically, this could accelerate even more AI-driven job replacement, leading to further disruptions. The cycle is clear: the faster we adopt AI, the faster traditional jobs become obsolete.

Looking ahead, if our next-generation Singaporeans focus on AI-driven Robotics and Machine Intelligence, we may not be able to save all jobs globally—but we can certainly help our workforce transition faster into the new Industrialization era of Machine Intelligence.

The key question is: How do we balance AI adoption with sustainable employment?

"AI and the Labour Market: Evolution or Revolution?

Many think that – due to AI – we are on the brink of dramatic job losses.

But a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) suggests that, historically, labour market disruptions take decades to unfold.

Looking back over 140 years of employment data, the study finds that:

▪️ The most significant labour market disruptions happened between 1940 and 1970, when agricultural jobs disappeared.

▪️ Since 1990, the pace of occupational change has slowed, despite major advances in digital technology.

▪️ Even during the rise of the internet and automation, the labour market remained surprisingly stable compared to earlier periods.

So, what does this mean for AI?

The study suggests that AI is likely a General-Purpose Technology (GPT) – similar to steam power or electricity.

These innovations transformed work, but their full impact played out over decades.

Likewise, AI is expected to gradually reshape industries, rather than cause mass displacement in the short term.

So, instead of replacing jobs, AI will augment human work and create demand for new skills.

TLDR: businesses and workers should adapt and integrate AI, not expect an immediate employment crisis.

What do you think?

Is AI just another evolutionary step in the world of employment, or will it break historical patterns?

🔹 AI + Hiring: Smarter Recruitment Strategies

Ever feel like your phone reads your mind? One moment you’re talking about sneakers, and the next, Instagram bombards you with shoe ads. 🎯

Well, AI is now doing the same thing for hiring—except instead of making you buy things you don’t need, it’s helping companies find the right candidates.

🔍 What is Programmatic Advertising?
It’s an AI-driven process that automates job ad placements, ensuring they reach the right candidates in the right places—efficiently and cost-effectively.

Here’s why it’s a game-changer:

📌 Smarter Job Ads – Just like Netflix suggests movies you’ll actually watch, AI makes sure job ads reach people who actually fit the role.
💰 Pay for Performance – Recruiters now pay per click or per applicant, kind of like only paying for the episodes you actually watch (sorry, filler episodes!).
🎯 Precise Targeting – AI places job ads in the right places, just like how those too-accurate Amazon recommendations seem to know what you want before you do.
🔄 Auction-Style Placement – Think bidding for concert tickets, but instead, AI ensures job ads land in the best spots for the right audience.

The world of work is undergoing a rapid and profound transformation, driven by the relentless pace of technological change. New technologies and trends are reshaping industries and creating new career opportunities that were unimaginable just a few years ago. One such technology that is revolutionizing the job market is artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular, the role it is playing in transforming the job market is in focus.

"AI in Hiring: Is It Fair or Flawed? 🤖

AI is revolutionizing recruitment—from scanning resumes and shortlisting candidates to even conducting initial interviews. The promise? Faster, more efficient, and data-driven hiring decisions. But the big question remains: Can AI truly understand human potential?

Many organizations are adopting AI-powered recruitment tools to eliminate human bias, streamline processes, and improve candidate matching. However, critics argue that AI might be reinforcing biases instead of removing them. After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.
The Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring

✅ Why AI is a Game-Changer:
✔ Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.
✔ Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.
✔ Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.

⚠ Concerns About AI in Recruitment:
❌ Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.
❌ Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?
❌ Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.
With technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?

Instead of replacing work, AI is reshaping how we work:
✅ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐜𝐮𝐭: AI processes data at superhuman speed, but humans make the final call.
✅ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝: AI subtly reshapes workflows - email filters, smart scheduling - without us even noticing.
✅ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞: AI expands our choices, letting us test strategies before committing.

📉 𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬?
Most companies still track 𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐝, 𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐝, 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐠𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝. But what if…
🔹 AI helping me make 𝟏𝟎% 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 is more valuable than saving me an hour?
🔹 AI 𝐞𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐂𝐄𝐎 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐟𝐭𝐬 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 is worth more than cutting 5% of processes?

"Will AI Empower or Enslave? 

AI is no longer just about automating repetitive tasks. It is replacing roles once thought to require human intelligence—HR professionals, lawyers, doctors, teachers, and even artists.

The case for AI empowerment:

✅ Productivity and Innovation
AI can take over mundane, repetitive work, allowing humans to focus on creativity, strategy, and problem-solving.

✅ AI-Augmented Workforce
Instead of replacing jobs, AI could enhance human capabilities, creating new fields such as AI ethics, AI auditing, and AI-powered research.

✅ Global Accessibility
AI-driven education and healthcare can bring knowledge and medical expertise to the most remote corners of the world.

Remember:

AI agents are stepping into boardrooms, handling customer service, making legal decisions, and diagnosing diseases with precision.

#AI at Work: Augmenting, Not Replacing!

Anthropic just released some fascinating analysis using real-world data on AI's impact on the future of work (link in comments). Here are some key takeaways:

📌 Where AI is Thriving:
✅ Software Development & Technical Writing are leading the charge in AI adoption
✅ 36% of occupations use AI for at least a quarter of their tasks, while 4% rely on AI for three-quarters of their tasks

📌 AI is More About Augmentation (57%) Than Automation (43%)
Instead of replacing jobs, AI is enhancing human capabilities—helping professionals work smarter, not harder

📌 Who’s Using AI the Most?
🔹 Mid-to-high wage professionals (e.g.programmers, data scientists) see the most AI adoption.
🔹 AI adoption is lower at both the highest- and lowest-paid jobs, likely due to current tech limitations and practical barriers.

"OpenAI just launched AI agents that cost up to $20K a month.

That’s not just an AI chatbot. That’s an AI worker.

And if companies are willing to pay twenty grand a month for AI, that means they believe it’s more valuable than hiring a human.

Here’s what’s happening:

• These AI agents aren’t entry-level. They’re designed to replace high-income professionals—coding, research, problem-solving, even hypothesis testing.

• SoftBank just threw $3 billion at this. That’s not “maybe this will work” money. That’s “this is the future” money.

• OpenAI expects this to drive up to 25% of its revenue. That means companies are already lining up to integrate AI over human labor.

So here’s the truth—this isn’t about whether AI can do the job. It’s about who adapts first.

If you’re in a high-income profession, you need to be thinking about how to make AI work FOR you, not against you.
If your job involves knowledge work, this isn’t a drill—AI is coming for your industry.
If you’re still waiting to see how this all shakes out, you’re already behind.

- It's much easier to understand a candidate's fundamental knowledge by prompts.
- If used well and properly, AI can save you months, if not years of work.

"AI replacing jobs is a hot topic these days, and while AI is making progress, I’ve used it for trip planning and noticed a few things:

1 - It’s good for basics, but not for something curated. AI is great for general travel advice, like suggesting must-see spots, but for seasoned travelers looking for hidden gems, local expertise is still unmatched.

2 - You need to know how to ask the right questions. Writing a good prompt is key to getting useful answers, but even with daily use, I find it tricky sometimes.

3 - Fact-checking is essential. AI sometimes provides inaccurate or misleading information. I always double-check itineraries, timings, and details to ensure accuracy.

The biggest advantage of AI is its ability to process massive amounts of information quickly. However, to provide truly useful and reliable results, it needs to be constantly updated with accurate data from a reliable source.

These days, I see AI as a powerful tool to streamline routine tasks—checking documents for errors, generating simple itineraries, or summarizing tour descriptions. But when it comes to creating unique, high-quality travel experiences, human expertise remains irreplaceable (at least for now!).

"AI Won’t Take Over Corporate Jobs—Because Corporate Can’t Even Use It Yet

Most AI startups targeting enterprise have never actually worked in one. They assume AI can seamlessly replace workflows but overlook the realities of 50K+ employee orgs—silos, approvals, and budget cycles that move at a glacial pace. Without VP buy-in, nothing changes.

AI is replacing tasks. Jobs are shifting.

But these four skills? They’ll always be in demand whether you’re a solopreneur or climbing the career ladder.

1️⃣ Problem-Solving

AI follows instructions. You think critically.
If you can fix bottlenecks, you’ll never be out of work.

2️⃣ Communication
If you can’t sell, persuade, or explain, you’ll stay invisible.
Clarity builds trust, influence, and opportunity.
AI generates words, but you create real connections.

3️⃣ Adaptability & Learning
What worked last year? Might be useless next year.
The winners learn, pivot, and stay ahead.
AI is a tool—you use it or get replaced by someone who does.

➡️ AI-Powered Content Strategists ($120K-$180K) – AI-assisted branding & storytelling.

"Most companies are stuck in outdated hiring.

Let me be honest with you:

They post ads.
They sift through piles of resumes.
They scramble for talent.
They cling to old HR methods.

I used to chase traditional recruitment.
""Fill the position"" was my battle cry.

But that doesn't work.

Here's what changed:

I focused on ONE thing that transformed our hiring process.

Not ten strategies.
Not five strategies.
ONE strategy.

And something incredible happened...

The more I committed, the less old-school tactics mattered.

Those endless job boards?
Those generic resumes?
Those tedious interviews?

They stopped being important.


In the latestPodcast, I had an inspiring discussion with, VP of Digital Talent Transformation and Global Talent Acquisition at, about how AI is reshaping talent mobility, workforce planning, and career development.

In this episode, Jean discusses:

📌 AI is Changing Talent Retention
→ AI-driven marketplaces help employees find internal opportunities, reducing turnover

💡 HR Must Be Data-Driven
→ AI insights enable smarter workforce decisions, replacing guesswork

⚙️ Fixing Broken Internal Hiring
→ AI removes barriers, making career growth more accessible

🚀 Skills Over Job Titles
→ Prioritizing skills creates agile, future-ready organizations


Because here's the hard truth:

People may forget your old recruitment methods.
They’ll remember how you transformed talent.

Great leaders build people, not just fill positions.

With AI advancing rapidly, it’s tempting to think that replacing managers with AI could be an easy win. After all, AI can analyze data, automate workflows, and even provide performance feedback. But can it truly replace leadership?

While AI can support decision-making and streamline processes, leadership requires emotional intelligence, creativity, and adaptability—qualities that (so far) remain uniquely human.

However, if a manager lacks these essential human qualities and is only focused on data and decisions, then perhaps an AI could do the job just as well.

From what I’ve observed, AI isn’t replacing jobs. It’s boosting productivity in a way that elevates the average developer and allows teams to be more efficient.

- Company’s get more output per headcount and can make more money
- That money can be reinvested to hire more people and grow the business
- Junior developers can ramp up and add senior-level value much faster than before

- Use these projects to build a compelling portfolio

"Whenever people ask me ""How will AI help me and my business?"", I’ve realized they’re often asking completely different things. Some are curious about productivity, others about job security, and a few just want to know if AI can do their work for them.

But at its core, AI is about three things:
1️⃣ Insight – Making sense of massive data faster than humans ever could
2️⃣ Augmentation – Enhancing human skills, not replacing them
3️⃣ Automation – Handling repetitive tasks to free up time for more strategic work

Most of the anxiety around AI comes from its automation capabilities—understandably so. Job displacement is a real concern. But here’s what often gets overlooked: insight and augmentation actually enrich jobs.

✅ A lawyer using AI to draft contracts faster can now focus on negotiation strategies.
✅ A teacher leveraging AI-powered tutoring tools can personalize learning for every student.
✅ A data analyst using AI for trend detection can make smarter, faster decisions.

Rather than just replacing jobs, AI is changing the nature of work itself—often for the better. The real opportunity is in learning how to integrate it into your field, maximizing both efficiency and human creativity.

The robots aren't coming for your job – they're already here, and they've got your resume.

Everyone keeps saying, ""Don't worry, AI will create more jobs than it eliminates!""

But what if that's just a comforting lie we tell ourselves while automation silently devours entire career paths?

I've spent the last decade watching this transformation up close, and the data is becoming impossible to ignore.

Goldman Sachs recently reported that 300 million jobs could be replaced by AI by 2030.

That's not some distant future scenario – that's within your current career timeline.

Even more alarming, ResumeBuilder(.)com confirms that 23.5% of companies have already replaced workers with ChatGPT.

Not planning to replace workers.

Not thinking about replacing workers.

Already. Replaced. Workers.

The World Economic Forum predicts 7.5 million data entry jobs will simply vanish by 2027.

But surely your job is safe because it requires ""creativity"" or ""human judgment,"" right?

I used to believe my role in content strategy was irreplaceable – until I watched AI write compelling marketing copy in seconds that would have taken me hours.

Here's what nobody wants to admit: AI isn't just coming for repetitive tasks – it's rapidly mastering the creative and analytical work we thought was uniquely human.

The truth is more nuanced than total job apocalypse or business-as-usual.

Some roles will transform rather than disappear entirely.

New jobs will emerge, but they'll require radically different skills than many workers currently possess.

The transition will be brutal for millions who can't adapt quickly enough.

"Navigating the Dual Impact of Generative AI on Employment

Generative AI stands at a crossroads, poised to redefine the job markets by simultaneously threatening job displacement whilst creating new opportunities.

On one hand, Goldman Sachs forecasts that AI could automate up to 300 million full-time jobs across the US and Europe, particularly in sectors reliant on routine, repetitive tasks.

This presents a stark shift, with professions like writing, photography, and software development facing high automation risks. Conversely, as Ai automates 29.5% of current work hours by 2030, the potential for new job creation remains substantial.

The World Economic Forum anticipates 97 million new roles emerging by 2025, partially offsetting the 85 million jobs that could be displaced, emphasising a need for workforce transformation.

Crucially, this transition underscores the importance of upskilling, emphasising human skills such as creativity and collaboration, which remain irreplaceable by AI.

Coming back to the job market after a long break, the landscape is very different...bleak if you would. There seems to be this culture surrounding AI that could kill anyone's hope as a software engineer:

• AI is taking all the jobs
• You gotta pump out projects using AI to stay relevant on Github
Just to name a few.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for using AI to make our jobs and lives easier--that's the whole point of technology. But we can't let the culture take away the very thing that makes us humans: passion.

The passion that gives us a reason to smile at work. The passion that keeps us dreaming about what to build next. The passion that makes us DIVE into the problem and UNDERSTAND the problem instead of just fixing the problem. The passion that drives the acquisition of expertise that AI will never be able to replicate.

But let’s be real—this isn’t the first time technology has shaken things up. The internet didn’t replace marketers, but it sure changed how they work. Spreadsheets didn’t make accountants obsolete, but they did force them to level up.

AI is no different. It’s not here to take over—it’s here to amplify what we do best.

AI can write words, but it can’t tell a story that moves people.

It can analyze security threats, but it still needs human intuition to navigate complexity.

It can crunch data, but it can’t lead a team, inspire innovation, or make tough decisions.

The real question isn’t “Will AI replace me?”—it’s “How can I use AI to work smarter, think bigger, and make a greater impact?”

"Why AI Won’t Kill Jobs—But Poor Implementation Might 
 
AI is everywhere. But for all the talk about automation replacing jobs, here’s what’s missing: AI doesn’t eliminate jobs, bad strategy does.

1. Companies rushing to automate everything, only to realize efficiency without strategy just creates new problems.
2. Companies resisting AI entirely, only to fall behind competitors who use it to enhance human decision-making.

At FBSPL, we’re focused on the third path: AI as an amplifier, not a replacement. When used right, AI doesn’t take jobs—it removes friction, speeds up processes, and lets people focus on work that matters.

"AI and the Labour Market: Evolution or Revolution?

Many think that – due to AI – we are on the brink of dramatic job losses.

But a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) suggests that, historically, labour market disruptions take decades to unfold.

Looking back over 140 years of employment data, the study finds that:

▪️ The most significant labour market disruptions happened between 1940 and 1970, when agricultural jobs disappeared.

▪️ Since 1990, the pace of occupational change has slowed, despite major advances in digital technology.

▪️ Even during the rise of the internet and automation, the labour market remained surprisingly stable compared to earlier periods.

So, what does this mean for AI?

The study suggests that AI is likely a General-Purpose Technology (GPT) – similar to steam power or electricity.

These innovations transformed work, but their full impact played out over decades.

Likewise, AI is expected to gradually reshape industries, rather than cause mass displacement in the short term.

So, instead of replacing jobs, AI will augment human work and create demand for new skills.

TLDR: businesses and workers should adapt and integrate AI, not expect an immediate employment crisis.

What do you think?

Is AI just another evolutionary step in the world of employment, or will it break historical patterns?

Key takeaways:

- AI adoption is highest in software development and technical writing. About 36% of occupations see AI used in at least a quarter of their tasks, while only 4% use it for three-quarters of their tasks.

- AI is more about augmentation (57%) than automation (43%)—meaning it’s enhancing human work rather than replacing it outright.

- AI usage is highest in mid-to-high-wage jobs like programming and data science. It’s notably lower in both the lowest- and highest-paid jobs, likely due to AI’s current limitations and practical adoption barriers.

- Both low-wage and ultra-high-wage roles see little AI adoption—jobs requiring manual dexterity (like shampooers) or specialized human expertise (like obstetricians) are less affected. Instead, it’s the mid-to-high earners—think programmers and copywriters—who are the biggest AI users today.

"💡 AI is Here to Take Jobs… But is That a Bad Thing? 🤖💼

Klarna, the Swedish fintech giant, has made headlines by replacing the work of 700 employees by reducing its workforce from approximately 4,500 to 3,800. The company is focusing on AI-driven efficiencies in customer service and other operations. with AI. From customer service chatbots to fraud detection, loan approvals, and even marketing automation, AI is now handling tasks that once required human effort. The company plans to further decrease its headcount to around 2,000 employees.

This isn’t just about cost-cutting—it’s about efficiency. AI is reducing wait times, improving fraud detection, and making smarter, data-driven decisions faster than humans ever could.

But let’s talk about the elephant in the room. What happens to the people?

We’ve seen this before—automation replacing factory workers, ATMs replacing bank tellers, and now AI taking over knowledge-based roles. The question isn’t whether AI will take jobs (it already is!) but whether businesses and society will help workers transition to higher-value roles.

If you feel at risk, here’s what I’d advise:

✅ Develop AI literacy – You don’t have to become a developer, but understanding AI tools relevant to your industry will be a game-changer.
✅ Upskill in complementary areas – AI needs human oversight, creativity, and strategic thinking. Focus on skills like problem-solving, decision-making, and emotional intelligence.
✅ Find ways to work with AI, not against it – The most valuable employees will be those who know how to use AI to enhance their work rather than resist it.

The world of work is undergoing a rapid and profound transformation, driven by the relentless pace of technological change.

"Y Combinator’s latest batch application cycle just closed, once again pushing AI agents as the next billion-dollar opportunity. The idea? Fully automated AI replacing $100K/year jobs, unlocking massive value for startups.

But here’s the paradox: while YC fuels the hype, the reality looks far less promising :
- AI agents lack counter-positioning. As we know it, disruptive startups succeed by turning incumbents’ strengths into weaknesses—just like Netflix did when it cannibalized Blockbuster’s business model with a frictionless subscription. But AI agents don’t force incumbents into a dilemma since they can integrate these tools effortlessly, leveraging their distribution power and datasets.

- YC is its own nemesis. The very dev tools YC backs are making software absurdly easy to build, allowing companies to create their own AI-powered solutions instead of relying on startups.is already leading this shift, embracing AI to internalize software development and reduce reliance on third-party SaaS.

- The AI pyramid is crumbling. While many believe the AI market is structured as a layered pyramid where application-layer startups can thrive,is proving otherwise. Indeed, new tools like Deep Research help OpenAI escape the commoditization of foundational models, securing its place as a product company controlling user experience, absorbing value that was supposed to flow to application-layer startups, and positioning itself as the dominant interface for AI-powered work.

So why does YC keep pushing AI agents?

Because VCs don’t just invest out of conviction—they also invest out of necessity. With billions to deploy, they fund as many startups as possible, knowing most will fail. Being VC-backed doesn’t mean a startup is onto something big—it often just means an investor had no better place to park their money.

"The first real data on AI's workplace impact just dropped, and I'm fascinated by what Anthropic's Economic Index reveals.

While everyone's talking about automation and replacing jobs, 57% of AI use is actually augmentation - humans and AI working together to deliver better results. This matches what I've seen on the ground, especially in highly regulated fields like finance or fintech: AI enhances analysis but doesn't replace judgment.

Most telling: AI adoption clusters in mid-to-high salary knowledge work. Senior executives and physical laborers both show minimal AI impact. This tracks - AI excels at processing information, not at either making complex strategic decisions or performing physical tasks.

Here's the stat you should watch out for: Only 4% of jobs heavily use AI, but 36% are starting to experiment. We're seeing more ""Microsoft Excel for knowledge work"" than ""robots taking jobs.""

"AI Won’t Get You Hired—But AI-Powered Coaching Will

AI is everywhere.
Everyone is talking about:
- AI replacing jobs
- AI automating mundane tasks
- AI making work easier
But no one is talking about how Human Coaches Who Are Fluent in AI + Value-Based Decision Making is the ultimate career accelerator.

💡 The problem? Job seekers are automating everything—except the part that actually gets them hired.
❌ Automating tasks but not improving outcomes
❌ Applying faster but not standing out
❌ Optimizing resumes but not optimizing career strategy

Here’s What’s Missing:
Most people are stuck between two extremes—either ignoring AI or using it the wrong way. The real advantage? AI-powered coaching from someone who understands both strategy and technology.

🔹 AI makes job searching faster, but without strategy, positioning, and human connection, it won’t get you hired.
🔹 Human coaches fluent in AI help you stand out, build real relationships, and land offers—faster.
🔹 The future of job searching isn’t AI vs. humans—it’s AI + humans working together.

I’ve Been Studying This for Years—And I Use It Every Day
15 years ago, I was sleeping in my car—no network, no roadmap, no path forward.

But I refused to stay stuck. I learned how to position myself, build relationships, and continuously improve.

Today, I lead high-impact initiatives at Google, and for 10+ years, I’ve:
✔ Hired at top tech and consulting firms
✔ Consulted for top firms
✔ Coached executives & job seekers on AI-powered decision making

In my latest article, I break down exactly how to solve this problem—so you can use AI the right way and accelerate your job search.

The New Formula for Career Success:
💡 AI + Human Coaches Fluent in AI + Value-Based Strategy = Career Acceleration
🔹 AI alone is NOT the answer.
🔹 Human strategy alone is NOT enough.
🔹 The right blend of AI + expert coaching is how you win.

I am confused and need your help to understand ...

How can you say that AI-native companies achieve $3m+ in revenue per employee, up from $200k/employee, and in the same breath that “it’s not about AI replacing humans”?

By my calculation that is a 15x productivity improvement and doesn't it mean that 93% of humans in startups - and eventually in all companies- are no longer needed?

What am I missing?

Maybe the AI job description is different then the human job description?

Are we saying that we will have many more companies (each with very few people) and thus the same number of. humans will be needed as before?

Does ""not replacing people"" mean that humans don’t get fired, because they never got hired?

I hear this a lot. Many freshers think AI will replace software engineers, so they want to switch before it’s too late.

👉The Problem?

They see influencers sharing flashy “AI roadmaps”, hyping it up, making them feel they’ll be left behind if they don’t switch now.

So they rush to learn Python, TensorFlow, and cloud computing all at once—without understanding where to start or how deep to go.

But here’s what happens next: they struggle with math, statistics, and logic, find it hard, and eventually give up.

👉But is AI really replacing software jobs?

Not exactly. AI is changing how we work, not making developers obsolete.

✅ You don’t have to be an AI expert, but you must be AI-aware.

• Companies are integrating AI into software development, automating repetitive tasks.
• Knowing how to use AI tools is becoming as important as knowing how to write code.

Are you switching to AI because you love it—or because you’re afraid of missing out?

If you genuinely enjoy AI, go deep. Learn the math, master the models, and build real projects.

But if you’re only switching because of fear, you’re setting yourself up for failure.

This is what my CXO Accelerator Program is designed for.

To help ambitious professionals:
✅ AI-proof their careers
✅ Position themselves for high-level executive roles
✅ Learn what modern companies actually look for in a CXO

"🤖 Tech Tip Tuesday: AI Isn’t Taking Jobs—It’s Creating New Ones!
There’s a lot of talk about AI replacing jobs, but here’s the truth: AI is changing jobs more than it’s eliminating them. In fact, it’s creating entirely new roles that didn’t exist a few years ago.

🔹 How AI is Shaping the Future of Work 📊
✅ AI is Automating Repetitive Tasks – From data entry to scheduling, AI is handling routine work, freeing humans to focus on strategy and problem-solving.
✅ New Careers Are Emerging – Roles like AI Prompt Engineer, AI Trainer, AI Ethics Consultant, and Model Fine-Tuning Specialist are in high demand.
✅ Upskilling is Key – Learning how to work with AI (not against it) is the best way to stay ahead. AI won’t replace jobs—it will change how we work.

🔹 Real-World Example: AI in Finance 💰
Years ago, financial analysts spent hours manually crunching data. Today, AI does the heavy lifting, while analysts focus on insights, strategy, and decision-making. The job still exists—it just looks different!

🔹 The Takeaway 🚀
AI isn’t the enemy—it’s a tool. The question is: Are you evolving with it? Those who embrace AI will have a competitive edge in the job market.

"World Economic Forum reveals AI jobs that are most and least likely to be replaced by AI 🚨

World Economic Forum's latest report shows:
- 170 million new jobs will be created by 2030
- 92 million current roles will be displaced
- 44% of workers will need reskilling within 5 years

The jobs safest from AI? Chefs, sommeliers, and artisans at only 6% automation risk.

Why? Because AI can analyze data but can't taste wine like we do (yet).

The pattern is clear: The more technical and data-driven your job, the more likely AI can do it.

IMF Research from 2024 says AI will affect ~40% of global employment, with different impacts across economies:
- Advanced economies: ~60% of jobs exposed to AI
- Emerging markets: ~40% of jobs exposed
- Low-income countries: ~26% of jobs exposed

But there's hope for the human touch:
- Teaching: 80% human-centric
- Counseling: 86% human-centric
- Creative work: 83% human-centric

🚫 Accountants who just file taxes? Gone.
✅ The ones who advise high-net-worth clients? Untouchable.

I don’t think so, and here are some reasons why:

AI is creating more jobs than it’s taking.
By 2030, AI could generate 170 million new jobs—far outpacing the 92 million that automation will displace. Demand for AI specialists, cybersecurity experts, and creative thinkers is booming.

White-collar workers are feeling the impact.
Unlike past automation waves that affected blue-collar jobs, AI is now transforming knowledge work—coders, analysts, and even creatives. But AI isn’t replacing jobs; it’s redefining them.

Human-AI collaboration is the real game-changer.
Over 57% of AI use cases focus on augmenting human work, not replacing it. AI is taking over mundane tasks, giving professionals more room for strategy, creativity, and interpersonal skills.

Upskilling is key.
By 2030, 70% of job skills will have evolved. The winners? Companies investing in AI training and employees who embrace AI, not fear it.

AI will supercharge productivity and business.
McKinsey predicts AI-driven productivity gains could add $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. The real winners? Those who integrate AI early instead of resisting change.

🔹 India: 2,248 suicide deaths were specifically attributed to exam failure in 2022.
🔹 South Korea: 20% of school kids have thought about suicide due to academic pressure.
🔹 China: The

🔹 USA: $1.77 trillion in student

🔹 62% of Fortune 500 CEOs have advanced degrees—but companies are quietly dropping degree requirements because they don’t mean much anymore.
🔹 AI is learning faster than humans ever will. By the time you graduate, your job might not exist.

Meanwhile, companies complain they can’t find skilled workers. AI is replacing jobs faster than universities can update their courses.

Recently, I read the Future of Jobs 2025 report by the World Economic Forum and found several key insights that are particularly relevant to digital marketing. As technology rapidly evolves—especially AI and big data—the job market is also undergoing significant changes.

𝐁𝐢𝐠 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞
- The rapid growth of fintech, e-commerce, and AI-driven marketing is driving demand for data specialists and digital marketers.
- Professionals with expertise in big data analytics and digital strategy are increasingly in demand.

𝐀𝐈 𝐢𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
- AI-powered tools now automate many tasks, from data analysis to content optimization and personalized advertising.
- Rather than replacing marketers, this shift requires social media strategists to enhance their analytical and creative skills to stay competitive.

𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬
- As the working-age population grows, the demand for digital access is increasing.
- This opens up opportunities for marketers to leverage personalization, automation, and data-driven strategies to improve customer engagement.

By 2030, industries related to technology and data will continue to expand. AI and information processing technology are expected to create around 11 million new jobs.

𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝐬𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟑𝟎:
✅ AI & Big Data
✅ Technological literacy
✅ Creative thinking
✅ Lifelong learning
✅ Talent management
✅ Systems thinking
✅ Leadership and influence
✅ Analytical thinking
✅ Adaptability and resilience
✅ Automation and the role of humans in marketing

By 2030, automation and AI are projected to influence 81.5% of total work output. However, AI will not replace marketers; rather, it will enhance productivity and efficiency. While repetitive and operational tasks may be automated, strategic, creative, and analytical roles will still rely on human expertise.

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐲 𝐚𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐝?
- Embrace AI as a tool rather than fearing it. Those who know how to leverage AI effectively will have a competitive edge.
- Focus on skills that are hard to automate, such as strategy, creativity, data analysis, and customer experience optimization.
- Stay updated on technological trends and consumer behavior to adapt to industry changes.

Digital marketing is no longer just about advertising or content creation—it is increasingly intertwined with technology, data, and user experience. Marketers who can combine creativity, data-driven decision-making, and technological proficiency will be the leaders of the future.

"🚀 Exciting news! I’m thrilled to step into the role of Client Partner, Change & Transformation Enablement at Ripple Consulting – a boutique strategic change consultancy dedicated to helping organizations navigate transformation with a people-first approach. A huge thank you tofor bringing me onboard, and trusting me to help grow our brand and support our clients through their transformations, big and small.

Change is happening faster than ever, and nowhere is that more evident than in the conversations around AI and digital transformation. The big question I hear from leaders isn’t whether to embrace AI, but how to bring their people along for the journey.

So far, the goal of AI in most organizations isn’t to replace people – it’s to enhance how we work. But for that to happen, we need to understand our workforce:

🔹 Their skill levels & knowledge of AI
🔹 Their aptitude for adapting to new technology
🔹 Their motivations for engaging with AI in the workplace

This is where change management plays a critical role. At, we help organizations bridge the gap between AI adoption and human impact – ensuring teams are empowered, engaged, and ready to maximize the opportunities that AI brings.

If you're thinking about how to integrate AI into your business, drive digital transformation, or create a culture that embraces change, let’s connect!

"🚨 AI is transforming work—but at what cost? 🚨

As AI continues to reshape our workplaces, employees face a double-edged sword: the promise of greater efficiency and the pressure of constant adaptation. The rise of technostress—stress caused by rapid technological change—is a growing challenge, leading to burnout, disengagement, and mental fatigue.

🔹 Cognitive Overload: Endless new tools and updates can be overwhelming.

🔹 Fear of Obsolescence: Employees worry about being replaced by AI.

🔹 Pressure to Upskill: The need for continuous learning can feel relentless.

So, how can leaders turn AI-driven stress into sustainable success?

💡 Recognize the five types of technostress—techno-overload, techno-invasion, and more.

💡 Use tools like the Digital Flourishing Scale to assess team well-being.

💡 Coach teams to see AI as an opportunity, not a threat.

💡 Build a culture where learning is supported, not pressured.

AI should empower, not exhaust. As leaders, it’s our responsibility to ensure technology works for people—not the other way around.

• Bespoke Learning Journeys: AI will curate individualized learning paths, closing skill gaps and accelerating career growth.

• Tailored Leadership Coaching: “AI coaches” will offer personalized insights and recommended trainings to help leaders develop the skills they need to lead in this new era.

• Personalized Wellness Programs: AI-powered tools will monitor employee sentiment and provide resources to combat burnout and enhance mental health.

A new Pew Research survey found that 52% of U.S. workers feel more worried than hopeful about AI’s future at work. Only 6% think it will create more job opportunities for them in the long run.

For those looking to bring AI into the workplace, that’s a problem.

AI adoption is a major change. And like any change, it requires more than new technology. It also takes awareness, desire, clear processes, and more to ensure it actually works for people.

Worry and uncertainty happen when change feels out of our control.

The truth is that each use case will be different, but we will likely land somewhere in the middle of these extremes.  But also, let’s not be deceived, AI will impact customer experience jobs and a significant portion of these jobs will be replaced.  It’s already happening and will continue to happen.

"AI Won’t Replace You—But Someone Who Knows AI Will

For years, intelligence, knowledge, and technical expertise set professionals apart.
Today, AI has that intelligence—at a scale beyond human capability.

The result? Technical knowledge alone is no longer a differentiator.

What separates leaders from followers in the AI era is not what you know—it’s how you use AI to think, create, and solve problems in ways no one has before.

AI is already reshaping hiring trends.

- Overall job postings fell 8.4 percent in Q4 2024, signaling corporate caution.

- AI-related job postings surged by 68 percent in the same period, even as broader tech hiring slowed.

- AI jobs now represent 19.2 percent of all IT job postings, up from 8.3 percent just two years ago.

- AI is not replacing humans. But those who learn how to use AI effectively will replace those who don’t.

Another way to think about this is that in a quarter of high performing startups, individual engineers are now ~20x more productive — and we know this is not just a software or startup trend.

It’s hard to see how this rapid rise in productivity doesn’t negatively impact hiring, labor markets and wages significantly in the coming months and years unless we can similarly use AI to make education, reskilling and labor markets in general dramatically more personalized, resilient and efficient.

#MAANG companies setting a new hiring standard?

The hiring landscape is evolving rapidly. With AI-generated resumes flooding the market, recruiters at MAANG companies are facing a challenge - how do you differentiate a genuinely skilled candidate from one with a perfectly optimized but impersonal resume?

Well, enter video resumes.

Tech giants are increasingly prioritizing video introductions as part of their hiring process. Unlike traditional resumes, which often blend together due to AI-assisted tailoring, video resumes offer:

- Authenticity: Hiring managers get to see your communication skills, enthusiasm, and personality firsthand.
- Differentiation: Instead of relying on keyword-stuffed documents, candidates can showcase their real strengths in a more engaging format.
- Soft skills assessment: For roles requiring leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving, a well-crafted video can say more than a thousand words on paper.

While AI has made resume building more efficient, it has also led to uniformity. MAANG companies are adapting by prioritizing personal connection over automation.

What do you think - are video resumes the future of hiring, or just a passing trend? Would you be comfortable submitting one?

"Hiring or job searching? 🔍 
This new data will shift your strategy. 

1. Skills > Degrees. 🎓

1 in 3 companies are ditching degree requirements and going all-in on skills-first hiring.is part of this shift, only considering education if required (law degrees, etc). A lot of hiring managers are realizing demonstrated ability is a better predictor of job performance.

2. AI is reshaping recruitment. 🤖

AI is screening resumes, sourcing and matching talent, and taking first-round interviews. Companies using AI can potentially make faster, better hires and candidates who know how to work with it will have an advantage. It’s a powerful tool, but it still works best alongside human judgment, not instead of.

3. The global talent war is heating up. 🌍🔥

Global talent hubs like Mexico, Poland, and Vietnam are seeing rapid growth. At the same time, high-cost markets (think NYC, London, and SF) are losing top talent to flexible, distributed teams.

4. Increased time-to-hire. ⏳

60% of organizations reported an increase in time-to-hire in 2024, with interview cancellations and rescheduling being the primary bottlenecks. Making AI integration more important to help cut delays and improve efficiency (Remote has some announcements soon to help with this!! 🤖).

5. Passive vs active job seekers. 🕵️♂️

60% of American workers are passive candidates - not actively applying but open to opportunities. Hiring teams relying on inbound applications risk missing top talent.

What this means for hiring managers:

✅ Filtering by degree could cost you great talent. Skills-based hiring gives you access to candidates with real-world experience.

✅ Using AI alongside recruiter judgment leads to stronger hiring decisions. It streamlines the process, but human oversight remains key.

✅ Talent is moving beyond traditional hubs. Expanding your search to global talent markets (Mexico, Poland, Vietnam) can give you access to highly skilled candidates at competitive rates.

✅ Top talent isn’t always actively applying. Proactive sourcing is still important, and with 800M+ candidate profiles, Remote Recruit can help you find the best fit.

"** Rethinking Recruitment in the Age of AI **

The world of work is transforming, especially for knowledge workers.🎓
AI is not just automating tasks—it’s redefining expertise.

🚀 What’s Changing?
A decade ago, years of coding experience directly correlated with coding skill—no longer the case. AI tools enable newer coders to produce high-quality work faster.
However many companies still use outdated metrics like ""years of experience"" or questions like ""have you done this before?"" to assess talent.  ✓|✘

The real differentiators today are:
- Adaptability & learning agility 📚
- Clear, logical thinking & problem-solving 🧠
- Deep domain or technical knowledge in a given area 👨‍💻
- Effective collaboration & innovation 🔄
- Willingness to embrace new technology 🤖

How Companies Can Stay Ahead🏆
- Shift hiring focus from tenure to potential and mindset.
- Evaluate candidates based on their ability to integrate AI into workflows.
- Prioritize problem-solving, teamwork, and AI literacy over years of experience.

Organizations that adapt will attract top talent and stay competitive.

As technology continues to evolve, the role of AI in Human Resources is becoming increasingly indispensable. 🤖💼 It’s not just a trend—it’s reshaping the way we manage talent and enhance employee experiences. Here’s why AI is essential in HR today:

Efficiency and Automation 💡: Tasks like screening resumes and managing payroll can be automated, allowing HR teams to focus on more meaningful work, like fostering a positive workplace culture and developing talent.

Smarter Recruitment 🧑‍💻: AI tools help identify top candidates faster by analyzing resumes based on key skills and experience, reducing unconscious bias and streamlining the hiring process.

Boosting Employee Experience 😊: Virtual assistants and chatbots powered by AI provide quick answers to employee questions, improving engagement and satisfaction in the workplace.

Predictive Analytics 🔮: AI helps HR teams anticipate trends like employee attrition and performance, allowing them to act before issues arise and retain top talent.
Personalized Learning Paths 📚: AI tailors development programs to individual needs, ensuring employees are constantly growing and progressing in their careers.

Driving Diversity & Inclusion 🌍: By removing bias from recruitment and monitoring diversity metrics, AI helps organizations build fairer, more inclusive workplaces.

"T. Alexander Puutio and I were curious: as more and more companies adopt AI hiring tools, how does algorithmic bias affect job candidates?

Our research confirmed some not-so-surprising assumptions. For example, GPT-4o is more likely to select candidates who attended ""elite"" (see high-cost) schools.

We also stumbled upon some pretty absurd observations, like GPT-4o repeatedly selecting the first resume in a list even among otherwise equal resumes. I guess there is something about getting your resume to the top of the pile . . .

Our research, published in the, concluded that while AI hiring tools offer a cost savings for companies, both employers and candidates may lose out. Employers relying too heavily on AI hiring tools can overlook great candidates while candidates, stuck with an increasingly impersonal hiring process, may be rejected for arbitrary reasons at best or discriminatory ones at worst.

"My Take on Today’s Job Market

I’ve done my fair share of hiring and firing. When I ran my company, I didn’t rely on ATS, AI-generated resume scores or trendy hiring gimmicks. I looked for basic but invaluable skills—personality, willingness to learn, and genuine excitement for the position. You can learn more about a person just by sitting across from them and letting them talk than from any keyword-stuffed resume. I was raised on the advice “Listen more than you speak,” and it’s never steered me wrong. Every interview taught me something new.

Now, at 45, college-educated, and with more years of experience than some of these so-called ""career experts"" have been alive, I can’t help but roll my eyes at the latest wave of advice from fresh-faced professionals in their early 30s. Where exactly did they acquire these pearls of wisdom? From AI-driven hiring systems that scan resumes for trendy buzzwords and award points accordingly? Please. Their algorithms are just reflections of their own biases, reinforcing what they already think success should look like.

The thing is: one day, these same self-proclaimed experts will be 60-something, watching the next generation roll in with their ""superior"" methods, and they’ll be deemed outdated, just like the rest of us. The cycle will repeat, as it always has. And yet, today’s youth, much like every generation before them, believe they’ve cracked the code—that they are the most advanced version of humanity to date.

If that were true, then someone should explain how these so-called ""advanced"" beings are still producing the same basic byproducts as their ancestors—literally. Next time they’re changing their kid’s diaper, they might want to consider whether that mess is truly evidence of social and cultural evolution.

🛑 Amazon is cracking down on AI-generated answers in job interviews— yes, you read that right.

🤖 To be clear, Amazon is NOT opposing AI. The company actively uses AI in its operations, but when it comes to hiring, it wants real, human responses instead of AI-generated ones.

💡 Companies are getting smarter about AI, and if you're copy-pasting AI responses, you might be hurting your chances instead of helping them. Recruiters want to see your real skills, not AI-generated ones.

🎯 So, how do you stand out? Instead of relying entirely on AI, focus on building genuine interview skills, crafting a strong resume, and understanding what hiring managers actually look for.

🌟 This is exactly what industry experts discuss at Tech Jobs Fair— where professionals connect, share insights, and explore real-world hiring trends.

Highly recommend a read of Karin Kimbrough's blog where she notes some really interesting insights:

➡️ Work is changing, and AI is accelerating the shifts. Professionals entering the workforce today are on pace to hold twice as many jobs over their careers compared to 15 years ago.
➡️ AI adoption is expanding the boundaries of roles, enabling productivity, task rotation, and innovation. This is driving demand for adaptive talent — specifically, professionals who combine technical expertise with strong human skills.
➡️ According to new LinkedIn research, HR professionals list finding candidates with the right technical (51%) and soft (45%) skills as some of the top challenges they face - and nearly two-thirds (63%) say there’s a mismatch between the skills job seekers have and the skills their organisation needs. This insight isn’t surprising given the skills needed for jobs are expected to change 70% by 2030, accelerated by rapid developments in AI.

"The way organizations assess talent is undergoing a seismic shift—thanks to AI. Traditional hiring methods, which often rely on resumes and interviews, are being enhanced by AI-driven tools that promises greater efficiency, accuracy, and fairness.

🔍 AI-Powered Talent Assessment: What’s Changing?

✅ Data-Driven Hiring Decisions – AI analyzes vast amounts of candidate data to identify skills, competencies, and potential, reducing bias and improving hiring accuracy.

✅ Smart Screening & Matching – AI-powered applicant tracking systems (ATS) can scan resumes, match candidates to job descriptions, and rank them based on suitability—saving recruiters countless hours.

✅ Predictive Analytics – AI can assess not just current skills but also a candidate’s ability to learn, adapt, and succeed in a role over time.

✅ Gamification & AI Assessments – Companies are leveraging AI-driven assessments, including cognitive ability tests and gamified evaluations, to measure problem-solving skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit.

✅ Bias Reduction – AI can help mitigate unconscious bias in hiring by focusing on skills and performance indicators rather than subjective factors like name, gender, or background.

🚀 What’s Next?
As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more advanced talent assessment tools, including AI-driven video interviews that analyze speech patterns, facial expressions, and behavioral traits. While AI enhances efficiency, organizations must ensure ethical and fair use to avoid unintended biases.

"Happy Friday, LinkedIn Fam!

This morning, someone asked me, 'What’s the best AI career advice?'

It’s not what you think.

I see everyone scrambling:
→ Trying to read up on every AI tool
→ Pivoting their brand overnight to be AI this or AI that
→ Slapping “AI Expert” in their keywords and hoping for the best

I get it. I respect the hustle.

But almost no one is asking the real question:

The most valuable thing you can do right now?

Pause. Step back. Think.

Not about the tools.
Not about the trends.
Not about what everyone else is chasing.

About this:
We now have machine intelligence that is exponentially improving, endlessly scalable, and dirt cheap.

This isn’t just another wave of innovation.
It’s a fundamental shift in how value is created.

I thought to myself.
I’ve built companies, led teams, and been part of amazing innovation at Fortune 100s and startups alike. But when AI started reshaping entire industries overnight, I had to ask myself:

→ What do I bring to the table that AI can’t?
→ What skills do I need to evolve, not just keep up, but stay ahead?
→ What does leadership even look like in an AI-powered world?

I say take a step back.
Not to chase the latest AI trend.
Not to force-fit a business into the hype.
But to rethink the long-term value.

I challenge you to do this. Take a day.
Turn off the noise.
Step away from the frantic AI race.
And ask yourself the hard questions:
→ What unique value do I offer that AI can’t replace?
→ How will this change what people pay for?
→ What must I build, not just learn, to stay ahead?

Actually map out a vision.
Not just for next month. For the next year.
Even a rough long-term roadmap is 5x more valuable than chasing short-term tactics.

"Has AI Already Made Hiring Developers Obsolete?

Hi, Tom here.

Recent data from Indeed reveals that software developer vacancies are at just 65% of their January 2020 levels, marking a 35% decrease. Compared to the mid-2022 hiring peak, listings are 3.5 times fewer. Interestingly, while tech hiring has plummeted, overall job postings are up 10% since 2020.

So, why the sharp decline in tech roles?

•Pandemic hiring boom aftermath: Companies overhired in 2021-2022 and are now adjusting.

•Economic shifts: High interest rates and reduced VC funding have slowed startup hiring.

•AI productivity gains: Tools like GenAI are boosting developer efficiency, potentially reducing immediate hiring needs.

Yet, it’s not all gloom. Sectors like construction (+25%) and electrical engineering (+20%) are seeing growth. Plus, startups like Linear and Bluesky are thriving with lean teams.

"Robot & Human Recruiters Collaborating-Deciding Who Gets Hired:

The collaboration between robot recruiters (AI-driven automation) and human recruiters has the potential for a happy ending—but only if managed strategically. The key is augmentation, not replacement—where AI enhances human capabilities rather than eliminating them.

Here’s how this can play out:

Why It Can Work Well (The Happy Ending)

✅ Speed & Efficiency – AI can quickly scan and filter resumes, schedule interviews, and automate repetitive tasks, allowing human recruiters to focus on relationship-building and strategic hiring.
✅ Bias Reduction – AI can help eliminate unconscious bias in the screening process by focusing purely on qualifications and experience (if properly trained).
✅ Enhanced Data Insights – AI can analyze market trends, salary benchmarks, and candidate behavior to help recruiters make better hiring decisions.
✅ Scalability – AI allows recruiters to manage a larger talent pipeline without sacrificing personalization.

Potential Pitfalls (The Unhappy Ending)

⚠️ Lack of Human Touch – AI can’t replace the emotional intelligence, negotiation skills, and rapport-building that human recruiters bring.
⚠️ Bias in AI Models – If the AI is trained on biased data, it can amplify discrimination rather than reduce it.
⚠️ Candidate Experience Issues – Over-reliance on automation can make candidates feel like just another number in the system.
⚠️ Resistance from Recruiters – If recruiters feel threatened rather than empowered by AI, adoption could be slow and ineffective.

What’s the Best Outcome?

The best-case scenario is a hybrid recruiting model, where AI takes care of the grunt work (screening, scheduling, initial outreach), and human recruiters handle relationship-building, negotiation, and strategic hiring decisions.

🚀 The future of recruitment isn’t about AI replacing recruiters—it’s about making recruiters superhuman. 🚀

"AI is about to make traditional recruitment methods obsolete...if not already

Here's what we're seeing:
• Every CV is becoming perfectly optimised for each job description
• Application volumes are exploding
• Traditional screening methods are becoming ineffective
• Time-to-hire is increasing despite better tools

We believe relying on trusted networks and referrals will largely be unaffected by this, because you'll be tapping into something AI can't replicate (yet 😅): genuine professional relationships and trusted recommendations.

This isn't just our opinion:
• Referred candidates are hired 80% faster
• They stay 3x longer on average
• And recruitment costs drop by up to 50%

(Part of) The future of recruitment isn't about processing more applications, it's about accessing the right networks and getting qualified recommendations from trusted professionals.

"AI vs Hiring - What's Best for Your Business? 

A question now on the cards for all businesses looking to scale is - automate with AI or hire human talent?

Here are 5 key points to consider:

1️⃣ Understanding the Task

AI thrives on more rule-based logical tasks, boosting efficiency while reducing human error. When creativity, emotional intelligence or strategic thinking is needed, humans outperform AI.

2️⃣ Cost & Scalability

With no large salaries, tax contributions or onboarding costs, there's usually opportunity to scale output more cost effectively using AI, but it comes down to the task. Complex tasks need complex systems which, while scalable, require upfront costs and maintenance.

3️⃣ Technology Integration

Implementing AI requires infrastructure, investment, and training. While integration is getting smoother, there's still a transition period where training and testing is required, so hiring may be simpler and quicker in these instances.

4️⃣ Human Resource Development

The side many people don't focus on - training employees alongside AI increases job satisfaction. Employees develop new skills and have more time to prioritise their focus.

5️⃣ Ethical and Cultural Considerations

Morale amongst your team is key. Clear communication about AI's role is important to empower staff rather than create uncertainty. Transparency is also required for customer-facing AI integrations.


The best approach?

Focus on hiring for strategic and leadership roles but for others, empower existing teams with AI capabilities rather than just adding to the headcount.

This way you'll maximise output, manage costs and maintain staff morale.",2025-03-04,"{'likes': 0, 'comments_count': 0, 'reposts': 0, 'total_engagement': 0}",LinkedIn, ,Positive,Factual
"After reviewing thousands of resumes throughout my career, I’ve noticed common mistakes that hold job seekers back.

One of the biggest trends right now? Over-reliance on AI. AI tools can be a great starting point. They help with formatting, ATS optimization, and save time. But when candidates don’t take the time to proofread or customize their resumes, recruiters immediately notice. A generic, AI-generated resume won’t set you apart, it will blend in.

Another misstep? Trying to “hack” ATS systems with tactics like white ink keyword stuffing. Not only does this not work (since modern ATS software reformats the text), but it risks making your resume unreadable if a human reviewer does see it.

At the end of the day, your resume’s goal isn’t just to get past software. It’s to engage the person making the hiring decision. Clarity, strategy, and relevance matter.

"🤖 AI Isn't Taking Over Recruiting—It's Supercharging It! 🚀
There's a lot of chatter about AI replacing jobs, especially in recruiting. But let me tell you, from firsthand experience: AI isn’t taking over my role—it’s making me more productive, effective, and yes, even more human!

As a recruiter with over 20 years of experience, I've seen tools and trends come and go. But AI? It’s a true game-changer. I even have my own AI-generated DALL-E pic: I call her AI Lani 😄 and she helps me out with so much! 👏

Here's how AI is elevating my recruiting game:
✅ Efficiency Boost: AI takes care of time-consuming tasks like resume screening and writing candidate summaries, giving me more time to focus on what truly matters—building genuine relationships.
✅ Better Insights: With AI-driven analytics, I gain deeper insights into candidate profiles and market trends, helping me make smarter, data-informed decisions.
✅ Enhanced Candidate Experience: Automating routine communications ensures candidates feel valued and informed at every stage, without me missing a beat.
✅ Supporting, Not Replacing: AI brings the data and automation, but the human touch—understanding candidate motivations, company culture, and those “intangibles”—that’s still 100% me.
✅ Engaged Interviews: Tools like Fathom AI take notes during interviews, allowing me to stay fully present, connect meaningfully, and avoid the frantic note-taking.

And hey, even Kona and Lili 🐶🐾 love that I use AI—because it means more time to throw the ball for Lili and give Kona treats and belly rubs! 😂

The best part? AI empowers me to do what I love most: connecting with people, guiding careers, and helping companies find the perfect fit. It’s not about replacing recruiters but enhancing our ability to bring even greater value.

#solutions :

In today's fast-paced job market, many companies struggle to define clear job requirements—a challenge often rooted in undertrained HR teams and an overreliance on technology such as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and artificial intelligence (AI). This imbalance can lead to inefficient hiring practices that ultimately hurt both employers and candidates.

-The HR Conundrum
HR professionals are crucial in developing effective recruitment strategies. However, when HR teams lack the necessary training or experience, they may struggle to define roles with precision. This ambiguity results in:
Prolonged hiring cycles
Misaligned candidate selections
-Increased turnover rates
Research indicates that an overdependence on AI in hiring can cause companies to miss out on top talent—potentially costing up to $840,000 over two years due to poor hiring decisions.

-The Risks of Overdependence on ATS and AI
While technology can streamline recruitment, relying too heavily on these tools presents risks:
Loss of Human Judgment: AI may fail to evaluate soft skills, cultural fit, or potential—key ingredients for building a strong team.
Bias and Discrimination: AI systems trained on biased data can inadvertently reinforce existing prejudices, resulting in unfair hiring practices.
Alienation of Top Talent: Candidates often feel discouraged by impersonal, automated processes, with surveys revealing that 38% would reject offers from companies that rely heavily on AI.
-Impact on Candidate Well-Being
Ambiguous job requirements not only waste candidates’ time but also contribute to mental distress:
Increased Stress and Anxiety: Unclear roles can leave candidates uncertain about their fit, heightening stress during the application process.
Emotional Exhaustion: Extended ambiguity forces candidates to invest extra effort into deciphering vague expectations, which can lead to burnout.
Decreased Self-Efficacy: Repeated exposure to unclear job roles can erode candidates’ confidence in their abilities.
-Recommendations for Employers
To foster a more effective and humane recruitment process, consider these strategies:
Invest in HR Training: Ensure HR teams are equipped to define clear job requirements and engage meaningfully with candidates.
Balance Technology with Human Insight: Use AI for administrative tasks, but rely on human judgment for evaluating soft skills and cultural fit.
Regularly Audit AI Tools: Monitor and adjust AI systems to minimize bias and ensure fair hiring practices.
Enhance the Candidate Experience: Maintain transparent communication and provide personalized interactions to attract and retain top talent.
By addressing these challenges and adopting a balanced approach, companies can not only improve hiring outcomes but also create a more engaged and resilient workforce.

"Dear Readers,

It’s the question on everyone’s mind as industries undergo rapid transformation driven by AI and automation.

From customer service chatbots to advanced data-driven decision-making tools, AI is no longer the future—it’s here, reshaping how businesses operate. In 2023 alone, companies across industries reported a 30% increase in productivity by integrating automation technologies.

But here’s the other side: For many professionals, this shift has triggered anxiety about job security. After all, if AI can write code, generate reports, or analyze data, where does that leave the human workforce?

Breaking Down the Trend: What’s Really Happening?

The reality is more complex. While AI is eliminating repetitive, low-value tasks, it’s also opening up new roles and opportunities in areas like:
AI Implementation – Companies need specialists to integrate and maintain AI solutions.

Data Interpretation – Humans are still essential to contextualize and apply AI-driven insights.
Creative Problem-Solving – Innovation requires human ingenuity, something AI has yet to master.

A recent study by McKinsey found that 60% of jobs will require hybrid skills—technical knowledge paired with creativity, communication, and critical thinking. The winners in this new landscape will be those who adapt quickly, upskilling to stay ahead of these trends.

How Companies Are Responding

Leading organizations are approaching the AI shift strategically:
🔍 Upskilling programs – Investing in employee development to match evolving tech demands.
🔍 AI collaboration – Viewing AI as a tool to enhance productivity, not replace workers.
🔍 New job creation – Roles like AI trainers, automation analysts, and data strategists are becoming crucial.

What This Means for You

Whether you're an entrepreneur, manager, or employee, staying on top of industry trends is non-negotiable. Success will belong to those who continually learn, pivot, and embrace innovation.

"""Transform Hiring by Putting Skills First 🚀

Just read an insightful article by Raj Mukherjee on how AI is revolutionizing hiring by prioritizing skills over traditional credentials. It reminded me of the importance of looking beyond degrees and focusing on what truly matters—a candidate’s abilities.

Key takeaways:
✅ Rethink hiring requirements: Degrees don’t define talent. Over 70 million workers are ""Skilled Through Alternative Routes"" (STARs). Are we overlooking them?
✅ AI broadens the talent pool: AI helps match candidates with the right skills, even if they don’t fit the “traditional mold.”
✅ Diverse teams = better outcomes: Hiring for skills leads to more innovative, productive, and resilient teams.

As a Bench sales recruiter, I’ve seen firsthand how focusing on skills over credentials can uncover hidden gems. Let’s embrace this shift and build stronger, more inclusive teams.

"If your company doesn’t adopt AI in recruitment, you will lose!

The way companies hire talent is changing faster than ever—and AI is at the center of it. If your recruitment process is still relying on manual job postings, traditional sourcing, and human-only decision-making, you’re already losing the hiring race to competitors who are leveraging AI-driven recruitment.

Why AI is a game-changer in hiring

🚀 AI-generated job & assignment descriptions – No more manually writing job ads; AI analyzes market trends and auto-generates tailored descriptions.
🚀 Faster, smarter talent acquisition – AI instantly scans, filters, and ranks candidates based on skills, experience, and behavioral patterns.
🚀 Automated talent pool management – AI keeps track of availability, skills, and career progression, so the best candidates are always within reach.
🚀 AI-personalized communication – Integrating with tools like Crystal Knows, AI identifies personality types (DISC model) and adjusts communication style to maximize engagement.
🚀 Instant search & matching based on data – AI doesn’t rely on guesswork; it analyzes structured data to find the perfect fit faster than any recruiter ever could.

But here’s the problem: bad data = bad AI = bad hiring

❌ Outdated, unstructured ATS & CRM systems lead to inaccurate matches.
❌ No GDPR compliance? AI won’t be able to process candidate data.

Your competitors are already using AI—are you?

📌 Companies leveraging AI in recruitment are filling roles faster, reducing costs, and improving candidate quality.
📌 Those who don’t will be left behind, struggling with slow, outdated processes.

- Fix AI hiring systems so they don’t filter out great candidates
- Prioritize real skills and problem-solving over rigid job descriptions

"AI in HR: A Game-Changer or a Human Challenger?

AI is no longer just automating HR—it’s transforming it. From hiring to employee engagement, AI is reshaping how we work.
For years, we said, “AI can’t replace HR—it lacks emotional intelligence and creativity.” But is that still true?

💡 The real question is: How long before AI learns emotional intelligence and workplace culture?

AI is already detecting emotions, mimicking human interactions, and predicting workforce trends. It’s also driving key HR functions:

🔹 Talent Acquisition: AI scans resumes, analyzes soft skills and reduces hiring bias.
🔹 Learning & Development: Personalized training, AI-powered coaching, and skills gap predictions.
🔹 Diversity & Inclusion: AI detects bias, tracks workplace sentiment, and drives fair hiring.

AI won’t replace HR—it’s making it smarter. But are we truly leveraging its potential?

I am confident that having a strong network is more crucial than ever. Many roles are filled through direct referrals, resume handoffs, and proactive outreach from hiring managers via LinkedIn.

🔹 Stay informed on AI’s impact in your field. Start experimenting with AI tools and more advanced functionality. Reinvent, retool and refocus where necessary.
🔹 Strengthen connections with trusted professionals in your industry and areas of interest (LinkedIn connections, Virtual coffees, and Help others when possible)
🔹 Tailor your LinkedIn so your LinkedIn feed keeps you informed on your industry and areas of interest (Follow companies, Follow People)

"AI/ML jobs are exploding but most software engineers are looking in the wrong places & that’s why they’re missing out. 

As an Engineering Manager with 20+ years of experience, I’ve seen industry trends come and go.

But what’s happening with AI? This is different.

The U.S. government is investing $500 billion into AI infrastructure over the next four years.

Apple just announced 20,000+ AI-related hires.

And major players like Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI are leading the charge.

AI is going to become an even bigger domain than what it is now, with every company adopting some form of AI systems to enhance their products and services.

But here’s the problem I see most engineers trying to break into AI/ML face:

► AI/ML jobs are fragmented across dozens of platforms.
► Most people only search for roles at Big Tech, ignoring AI-first startups.
► By the time a job posting reaches LinkedIn or Indeed, thousands have already applied.

If you’re serious about breaking into AI/ML, you need to start looking where others aren’t.

I recently found a free AI job resource that updates hourly with AI/ML jobs from 20,000+ companies, not just the ones everyone already knows about.

🔹 You don’t have to filter through generic job boards.
🔹 You can easily find AI-first startups and fast-growing companies.

And as a result, you can stay ahead of the curve, before jobs flood with thousands of applicants.

I get it. Companies are flooded with applications. Automation is tempting. But are we really okay outsourcing decisions about someone's livelihood to an algorithm? An algorithm that could be biased, flawed, or just plain wrong?

The lack of personalized feedback. It's about a trend that dehumanizes the job search process. Makes candidates feel like numbers, not people with skills, dreams, & stories to tell.

We need to talk about this. Are we building a future where humans are judged by robots?

"From building the Alexa AI team to shaping the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) at Amazon—Alexander Lopez has spent the last three years recruiting top AI talent to drive innovation. Curious about what it takes to break into AGI? Alex shares insights on career paths, industry trends, and what makes recruiting in this space so unique. Read on for his advice!

🎤 Can you tell us about your journey at Amazon and what led you to your current role as a recruiter for Amazon AGI?
Over 3 years ago, I was tapped on the shoulder by an old Recruiting Manager to join and support the recruiting efforts to build out Alexa AI. Fast forward to 2025, I now support Amazon AGI, the team creating state-of-the-art foundation models that deliver frontier intelligence and industry leading price-performance on Amazon Bedrock.

🎤 What types of roles is AGI hiring for?
There’s a lot of unique opportunities here at Amazon. There’s a link at the end of this post that shares all the open job opportunities, among them you’ll find positions at different levels for Machine Learning Data Associates, Engineers, Applied Scientists, and more.

🎤 What advice do you have for someone who wants to start their career in the AGI space?
What was new, is no longer new, as the world of AGI is rapidly evolving! That said, ideally, we’re looking for talent who can bridge the gap between different domains, think creatively about complex problems, and work well in highly collaborative environments. Additionally, those who can learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, and contribute to the advancement of this transformative field.

🎤 Happy 3 year Amaversary! What’s been a standout moment for you so far since starting here?
Over the past 3 years, our team has grown exponentially, bringing on board some of the brightest minds in the industry. I'm immensely proud of the incredible talent we've recruited, the innovative solutions our new Amazonians have delivered to our customers, and the constant drive to hire and develop the best (Key Amazon Leadership principle).

🎤 What’s something unique about your job as a recruiter that people might not expect?
Collaboration, co-creation, and synergy comes to mind. Whether it's jumping on info-calls with passive candidates or joint-sourcing sessions, our AGI leaders take a vested interest in our efforts to scale up and build out our talent pools.

"AI is changing M&A… or is it?

Everyone’s talking about how AI is ""revolutionising"" deal origination and due diligence. But let’s be real—where is it actually making an impact, and where is it just buzz?

✅ Where AI delivers real results:
🔹 Automated deal sourcing → AI flags high-potential targets based on hiring trends, partnerships, and leadership moves.
🔹 Due diligence risk detection → AI scans contracts, litigation records, and compliance risks in minutes, not weeks.
🔹 Predictive analytics → AI models can forecast which companies are primed for acquisition based on historical data.

❌ Where AI still falls short:
🔹 Relationship-driven negotiations → No algorithm can replace trust.
🔹 Contextual judgment calls → AI can detect signals, but it can’t make strategic decisions for you.
🔹 Bad data, bad outcomes → AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on.

For years, intelligence, knowledge, and technical expertise set professionals apart.
Today, AI has that intelligence—at a scale beyond human capability.

- AI-related job postings surged by 68 percent in the same period, even as broader tech hiring slowed.

✅ Automated interview scheduling: No more back-and-forth emails—AI suggests optimal interview slots for both candidates and hiring teams.
✅ Passive candidate research: AI monitors social media, GitHub, and industry trends to find top talent who aren’t actively job-seeking.
✅ Video interview analysis: AI assesses tone, confidence, and engagement, helping recruiters evaluate soft skills more objectively.
✅ Talent market predictions: AI analyzes hiring trends, skill shortages, and salary benchmarks, allowing businesses to plan smarter recruitment strategies.

"AI vs. traditional hiring → the time & cost breakdown

Still relying on manual hiring? 

That’s why you’re losing top IT talent.

Here’s how AI-powered recruitment is crushing traditional hiring methods:

📊 ⏳ Time-to-hire

Without AI: 30+ days ⏳ (Resume screening alone takes 10+ hours per role!)
With AI: 7-14 days ⚡ (Instant screening & automated matching)

📊 📈 Resume screening speed

Without AI: 1 recruiter = 50 resumes/hour
With AI: 1 AI system = 1000+ resumes/hour (with higher accuracy)

📊 👻 Candidate drop-off rate

Without AI: 50%+ (slow response times = candidates ghosting)
With AI: 20% or less (instant engagement & real-time updates)

📊 💰 Cost per hire

Without AI: €7,500+ (recruiters spending weeks per hire)
With AI: €3,000-€5,000 (cutting manual effort & time wastage)

📊 🏆 Offer acceptance rate

Without AI: 50-60% (delays kill interest)
With AI: 80%+ (faster process = higher engagement)

AI isn’t replacing recruiters.

It’s making them 10x more efficient.

#MAANG companies setting a new hiring standard?

The hiring landscape is evolving rapidly. With AI-generated resumes flooding the market, recruiters at MAANG companies are facing a challenge - how do you differentiate a genuinely skilled candidate from one with a perfectly optimized but impersonal resume?

Well, enter video resumes.

Tech giants are increasingly prioritizing video introductions as part of their hiring process. Unlike traditional resumes, which often blend together due to AI-assisted tailoring, video resumes offer:

- Authenticity: Hiring managers get to see your communication skills, enthusiasm, and personality firsthand.
- Differentiation: Instead of relying on keyword-stuffed documents, candidates can showcase their real strengths in a more engaging format.
- Soft skills assessment: For roles requiring leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving, a well-crafted video can say more than a thousand words on paper.

While AI has made resume building more efficient, it has also led to uniformity. MAANG companies are adapting by prioritizing personal connection over automation.

What do you think - are video resumes the future of hiring, or just a passing trend? Would you be comfortable submitting one?

This new data will shift your strategy. 

1. Skills > Degrees. 🎓

1 in 3 companies are ditching degree requirements and going all-in on skills-first hiring.is part of this shift, only considering education if required (law degrees, etc). A lot of hiring managers are realizing demonstrated ability is a better predictor of job performance.

2. AI is reshaping recruitment. 🤖

AI is screening resumes, sourcing and matching talent, and taking first-round interviews. Companies using AI can potentially make faster, better hires and candidates who know how to work with it will have an advantage. It’s a powerful tool, but it still works best alongside human judgment, not instead of.

3. The global talent war is heating up. 🌍🔥

Global talent hubs like Mexico, Poland, and Vietnam are seeing rapid growth. At the same time, high-cost markets (think NYC, London, and SF) are losing top talent to flexible, distributed teams.

4. Increased time-to-hire. ⏳

60% of organizations reported an increase in time-to-hire in 2024, with interview cancellations and rescheduling being the primary bottlenecks. Making AI integration more important to help cut delays and improve efficiency (Remote has some announcements soon to help with this!! 🤖).

5. Passive vs active job seekers. 🕵️♂️

60% of American workers are passive candidates - not actively applying but open to opportunities. Hiring teams relying on inbound applications risk missing top talent.

What this means for hiring managers:

✅ Filtering by degree could cost you great talent. Skills-based hiring gives you access to candidates with real-world experience.

✅ Using AI alongside recruiter judgment leads to stronger hiring decisions. It streamlines the process, but human oversight remains key.

✅ Talent is moving beyond traditional hubs. Expanding your search to global talent markets (Mexico, Poland, Vietnam) can give you access to highly skilled candidates at competitive rates.

✅ Top talent isn’t always actively applying. Proactive sourcing is still important, and with 800M+ candidate profiles, Remote Recruit can help you find the best fit.

- Clear, logical thinking & problem-solving 🧠
- Deep domain or technical knowledge in a given area 👨‍💻

Our research confirmed some not-so-surprising assumptions. For example, GPT-4o is more likely to select candidates who attended ""elite"" (see high-cost) schools.

We also stumbled upon some pretty absurd observations, like GPT-4o repeatedly selecting the first resume in a list even among otherwise equal resumes. I guess there is something about getting your resume to the top of the pile . . .

Our research, published in the, concluded that while AI hiring tools offer a cost savings for companies, both employers and candidates may lose out.

🏆 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐊𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐀𝐈 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐇𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐧-𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜 🏆
To prevent AI from turning hiring into a cold, automated mechanism, companies must find a balance between technology and human interaction.
Here are four key strategies to maintain a human touch in AI-driven recruitment:

✅ 🤝 A Hybrid Approach
AI can streamline pre-selection, but human interaction must remain central in interviews and final evaluations.
✅ 💬 Personalized Communication
Avoid fully automated responses.
Ensure candidates receive real, meaningful engagement.
✅ 🧠 Soft Skills Assessment
AI helps, but a human recruiter is still the best judge of motivation, cultural fit, and purpose.
Use real conversations, role-playing, and behavioral interviews.
✅ 🔎 Transparency & Ethics
Candidates should know when AI is involved and how decisions are made.
Avoid bias by continuously improving AI models.

"My Take on Today’s Job Market

I’ve done my fair share of hiring and firing. When I ran my company, I didn’t rely on ATS, AI-generated resume scores or trendy hiring gimmicks. I looked for basic but invaluable skills—personality, willingness to learn, and genuine excitement for the position. You can learn more about a person just by sitting across from them and letting them talk than from any keyword-stuffed resume. I was raised on the advice “Listen more than you speak,” and it’s never steered me wrong. Every interview taught me something new.

Now, at 45, college-educated, and with more years of experience than some of these so-called ""career experts"" have been alive, I can’t help but roll my eyes at the latest wave of advice from fresh-faced professionals in their early 30s. Where exactly did they acquire these pearls of wisdom? From AI-driven hiring systems that scan resumes for trendy buzzwords and award points accordingly? Please. Their algorithms are just reflections of their own biases, reinforcing what they already think success should look like.

The thing is: one day, these same self-proclaimed experts will be 60-something, watching the next generation roll in with their ""superior"" methods, and they’ll be deemed outdated, just like the rest of us. The cycle will repeat, as it always has. And yet, today’s youth, much like every generation before them, believe they’ve cracked the code—that they are the most advanced version of humanity to date.

If that were true, then someone should explain how these so-called ""advanced"" beings are still producing the same basic byproducts as their ancestors—literally. Next time they’re changing their kid’s diaper, they might want to consider whether that mess is truly evidence of social and cultural evolution. Because if it is, then what does that make the person responsible for cleaning it up?",2025-03-08,"{'likes': 0, 'comments_count': 0, 'reposts': 0, 'total_engagement': 0}",LinkedIn, ,Positive,Factual

"Have you seen the latest LinkedIn Work Change Report?

Highly recommend a read of Karin Kimbrough's blog where she notes some really interesting insights:

➡️ Work is changing, and AI is accelerating the shifts. Professionals entering the workforce today are on pace to hold twice as many jobs over their careers compared to 15 years ago.
➡️ AI adoption is expanding the boundaries of roles, enabling productivity, task rotation, and innovation. This is driving demand for adaptive talent — specifically, professionals who combine technical expertise with strong human skills.
➡️ According to new LinkedIn research, HR professionals list finding candidates with the right technical (51%) and soft (45%) skills as some of the top challenges they face - and nearly two-thirds (63%) say there’s a mismatch between the skills job seekers have and the skills their organisation needs. This insight isn’t surprising given the skills needed for jobs are expected to change 70% by 2030, accelerated by rapid developments in AI.

"The way organizations assess talent is undergoing a seismic shift—thanks to AI. Traditional hiring methods, which often rely on resumes and interviews, are being enhanced by AI-driven tools that promises greater efficiency, accuracy, and fairness.

🔍 AI-Powered Talent Assessment: What’s Changing?

✅ Data-Driven Hiring Decisions – AI analyzes vast amounts of candidate data to identify skills, competencies, and potential, reducing bias and improving hiring accuracy.

✅ Smart Screening & Matching – AI-powered applicant tracking systems (ATS) can scan resumes, match candidates to job descriptions, and rank them based on suitability—saving recruiters countless hours.

✅ Predictive Analytics – AI can assess not just current skills but also a candidate’s ability to learn, adapt, and succeed in a role over time.

✅ Gamification & AI Assessments – Companies are leveraging AI-driven assessments, including cognitive ability tests and gamified evaluations, to measure problem-solving skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit.

✅ Bias Reduction – AI can help mitigate unconscious bias in hiring by focusing on skills and performance indicators rather than subjective factors like name, gender, or background.

🚀 What’s Next?
As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more advanced talent assessment tools, including AI-driven video interviews that analyze speech patterns, facial expressions, and behavioral traits. While AI enhances efficiency, organizations must ensure ethical and fair use to avoid unintended biases.

"Happy Friday, LinkedIn Fam!

This morning, someone asked me, 'What’s the best AI career advice?'

It’s not what you think.

I see everyone scrambling:
→ Trying to read up on every AI tool
→ Pivoting their brand overnight to be AI this or AI that
→ Slapping “AI Expert” in their keywords and hoping for the best

I get it. I respect the hustle.

But almost no one is asking the real question:

The most valuable thing you can do right now?

Pause. Step back. Think.

Not about the tools.
Not about the trends.
Not about what everyone else is chasing.

About this:
We now have machine intelligence that is exponentially improving, endlessly scalable, and dirt cheap.

This isn’t just another wave of innovation.
It’s a fundamental shift in how value is created.

I thought to myself.
I’ve built companies, led teams, and been part of amazing innovation at Fortune 100s and startups alike. But when AI started reshaping entire industries overnight, I had to ask myself:

→ What do I bring to the table that AI can’t?
→ What skills do I need to evolve, not just keep up, but stay ahead?
→ What does leadership even look like in an AI-powered world?

I say take a step back.
Not to chase the latest AI trend.
Not to force-fit a business into the hype.
But to rethink the long-term value.

I challenge you to do this. Take a day.
Turn off the noise.
Step away from the frantic AI race.
And ask yourself the hard questions:
→ What unique value do I offer that AI can’t replace?
→ How will this change what people pay for?
→ What must I build, not just learn, to stay ahead?

Actually map out a vision.
Not just for next month. For the next year.
Even a rough long-term roadmap is 5x more valuable than chasing short-term tactics.

"Has AI Already Made Hiring Developers Obsolete?

Hi, Tom here.

Recent data from Indeed reveals that software developer vacancies are at just 65% of their January 2020 levels, marking a 35% decrease. Compared to the mid-2022 hiring peak, listings are 3.5 times fewer. Interestingly, while tech hiring has plummeted, overall job postings are up 10% since 2020.

So, why the sharp decline in tech roles?

•Pandemic hiring boom aftermath: Companies overhired in 2021-2022 and are now adjusting.

•Economic shifts: High interest rates and reduced VC funding have slowed startup hiring.

•AI productivity gains: Tools like GenAI are boosting developer efficiency, potentially reducing immediate hiring needs.

Yet, it’s not all gloom. Sectors like construction (+25%) and electrical engineering (+20%) are seeing growth. Plus, startups like Linear and Bluesky are thriving with lean teams.

"Robot & Human Recruiters Collaborating-Deciding Who Gets Hired:

The collaboration between robot recruiters (AI-driven automation) and human recruiters has the potential for a happy ending—but only if managed strategically. The key is augmentation, not replacement—where AI enhances human capabilities rather than eliminating them.

Here’s how this can play out:

Why It Can Work Well (The Happy Ending)

✅ Speed & Efficiency – AI can quickly scan and filter resumes, schedule interviews, and automate repetitive tasks, allowing human recruiters to focus on relationship-building and strategic hiring.
✅ Bias Reduction – AI can help eliminate unconscious bias in the screening process by focusing purely on qualifications and experience (if properly trained).
✅ Enhanced Data Insights – AI can analyze market trends, salary benchmarks, and candidate behavior to help recruiters make better hiring decisions.
✅ Scalability – AI allows recruiters to manage a larger talent pipeline without sacrificing personalization.

Potential Pitfalls (The Unhappy Ending)

⚠️ Lack of Human Touch – AI can’t replace the emotional intelligence, negotiation skills, and rapport-building that human recruiters bring.
⚠️ Bias in AI Models – If the AI is trained on biased data, it can amplify discrimination rather than reduce it.
⚠️ Candidate Experience Issues – Over-reliance on automation can make candidates feel like just another number in the system.
⚠️ Resistance from Recruiters – If recruiters feel threatened rather than empowered by AI, adoption could be slow and ineffective.

What’s the Best Outcome?

The best-case scenario is a hybrid recruiting model, where AI takes care of the grunt work (screening, scheduling, initial outreach), and human recruiters handle relationship-building, negotiation, and strategic hiring decisions.

🚀 The future of recruitment isn’t about AI replacing recruiters—it’s about making recruiters superhuman. 🚀

Here's what we're seeing:
• Every CV is becoming perfectly optimised for each job description
• Application volumes are exploding
• Traditional screening methods are becoming ineffective
• Time-to-hire is increasing despite better tools

We believe relying on trusted networks and referrals will largely be unaffected by this, because you'll be tapping into something AI can't replicate (yet 😅): genuine professional relationships and trusted recommendations.

This isn't just our opinion:
• Referred candidates are hired 80% faster
• They stay 3x longer on average
• And recruitment costs drop by up to 50%

"AI vs Hiring - What's Best for Your Business? 

A question now on the cards for all businesses looking to scale is - automate with AI or hire human talent?

Here are 5 key points to consider:

1️⃣ Understanding the Task

AI thrives on more rule-based logical tasks, boosting efficiency while reducing human error. When creativity, emotional intelligence or strategic thinking is needed, humans outperform AI.

2️⃣ Cost & Scalability

With no large salaries, tax contributions or onboarding costs, there's usually opportunity to scale output more cost effectively using AI, but it comes down to the task. Complex tasks need complex systems which, while scalable, require upfront costs and maintenance.

3️⃣ Technology Integration

Implementing AI requires infrastructure, investment, and training. While integration is getting smoother, there's still a transition period where training and testing is required, so hiring may be simpler and quicker in these instances.

4️⃣ Human Resource Development

The side many people don't focus on - training employees alongside AI increases job satisfaction. Employees develop new skills and have more time to prioritise their focus.

5️⃣ Ethical and Cultural Considerations

Morale amongst your team is key. Clear communication about AI's role is important to empower staff rather than create uncertainty. Transparency is also required for customer-facing AI integrations.


The best approach?

Focus on hiring for strategic and leadership roles but for others, empower existing teams with AI capabilities rather than just adding to the headcount.

"After reviewing thousands of resumes throughout my career, I’ve noticed common mistakes that hold job seekers back.

One of the biggest trends right now? Over-reliance on AI. AI tools can be a great starting point. They help with formatting, ATS optimization, and save time. But when candidates don’t take the time to proofread or customize their resumes, recruiters immediately notice. A generic, AI-generated resume won’t set you apart, it will blend in.

Another misstep? Trying to “hack” ATS systems with tactics like white ink keyword stuffing. Not only does this not work (since modern ATS software reformats the text), but it risks making your resume unreadable if a human reviewer does see it.

"🤖 AI Isn't Taking Over Recruiting—It's Supercharging It! 🚀
There's a lot of chatter about AI replacing jobs, especially in recruiting. But let me tell you, from firsthand experience: AI isn’t taking over my role—it’s making me more productive, effective, and yes, even more human!

As a recruiter with over 20 years of experience, I've seen tools and trends come and go. But AI? It’s a true game-changer. I even have my own AI-generated DALL-E pic: I call her AI Lani 😄 and she helps me out with so much! 👏

Here's how AI is elevating my recruiting game:
✅ Efficiency Boost: AI takes care of time-consuming tasks like resume screening and writing candidate summaries, giving me more time to focus on what truly matters—building genuine relationships.
✅ Better Insights: With AI-driven analytics, I gain deeper insights into candidate profiles and market trends, helping me make smarter, data-informed decisions.
✅ Enhanced Candidate Experience: Automating routine communications ensures candidates feel valued and informed at every stage, without me missing a beat.
✅ Supporting, Not Replacing: AI brings the data and automation, but the human touch—understanding candidate motivations, company culture, and those “intangibles”—that’s still 100% me.
✅ Engaged Interviews: Tools like Fathom AI take notes during interviews, allowing me to stay fully present, connect meaningfully, and avoid the frantic note-taking.

And hey, even Kona and Lili 🐶🐾 love that I use AI—because it means more time to throw the ball for Lili and give Kona treats and belly rubs! 😂

In today's fast-paced job market, many companies struggle to define clear job requirements—a challenge often rooted in undertrained HR teams and an overreliance on technology such as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and artificial intelligence (AI). This imbalance can lead to inefficient hiring practices that ultimately hurt both employers and candidates.

-The HR Conundrum
HR professionals are crucial in developing effective recruitment strategies. However, when HR teams lack the necessary training or experience, they may struggle to define roles with precision. This ambiguity results in:
Prolonged hiring cycles
Misaligned candidate selections
-Increased turnover rates
Research indicates that an overdependence on AI in hiring can cause companies to miss out on top talent—potentially costing up to $840,000 over two years due to poor hiring decisions.

-The Risks of Overdependence on ATS and AI
While technology can streamline recruitment, relying too heavily on these tools presents risks:
Loss of Human Judgment: AI may fail to evaluate soft skills, cultural fit, or potential—key ingredients for building a strong team.
Bias and Discrimination: AI systems trained on biased data can inadvertently reinforce existing prejudices, resulting in unfair hiring practices.
Alienation of Top Talent: Candidates often feel discouraged by impersonal, automated processes, with surveys revealing that 38% would reject offers from companies that rely heavily on AI.
-Impact on Candidate Well-Being
Ambiguous job requirements not only waste candidates’ time but also contribute to mental distress:
Increased Stress and Anxiety: Unclear roles can leave candidates uncertain about their fit, heightening stress during the application process.
Emotional Exhaustion: Extended ambiguity forces candidates to invest extra effort into deciphering vague expectations, which can lead to burnout.
Decreased Self-Efficacy: Repeated exposure to unclear job roles can erode candidates’ confidence in their abilities.
-Recommendations for Employers
To foster a more effective and humane recruitment process, consider these strategies:
Invest in HR Training: Ensure HR teams are equipped to define clear job requirements and engage meaningfully with candidates.
Balance Technology with Human Insight: Use AI for administrative tasks, but rely on human judgment for evaluating soft skills and cultural fit.
Regularly Audit AI Tools: Monitor and adjust AI systems to minimize bias and ensure fair hiring practices.
Enhance the Candidate Experience: Maintain transparent communication and provide personalized interactions to attract and retain top talent.
By addressing these challenges and adopting a balanced approach, companies can not only improve hiring outcomes but also create a more engaged and resilient workforce.

"Dear Readers,

It’s the question on everyone’s mind as industries undergo rapid transformation driven by AI and automation.

From customer service chatbots to advanced data-driven decision-making tools, AI is no longer the future—it’s here, reshaping how businesses operate. In 2023 alone, companies across industries reported a 30% increase in productivity by integrating automation technologies.

But here’s the other side: For many professionals, this shift has triggered anxiety about job security. After all, if AI can write code, generate reports, or analyze data, where does that leave the human workforce?

Breaking Down the Trend: What’s Really Happening?

The reality is more complex. While AI is eliminating repetitive, low-value tasks, it’s also opening up new roles and opportunities in areas like:
AI Implementation – Companies need specialists to integrate and maintain AI solutions.

Data Interpretation – Humans are still essential to contextualize and apply AI-driven insights.
Creative Problem-Solving – Innovation requires human ingenuity, something AI has yet to master.

A recent study by McKinsey found that 60% of jobs will require hybrid skills—technical knowledge paired with creativity, communication, and critical thinking. The winners in this new landscape will be those who adapt quickly, upskilling to stay ahead of these trends.

How Companies Are Responding

Leading organizations are approaching the AI shift strategically:
🔍 Upskilling programs – Investing in employee development to match evolving tech demands.
🔍 AI collaboration – Viewing AI as a tool to enhance productivity, not replace workers.
🔍 New job creation – Roles like AI trainers, automation analysts, and data strategists are becoming crucial.

What This Means for You

Whether you're an entrepreneur, manager, or employee, staying on top of industry trends is non-negotiable. Success will belong to those who continually learn, pivot, and embrace innovation.

💡 How do you see AI and automation impacting your role or industry?

"""Transform Hiring by Putting Skills First 🚀

Just read an insightful article by Raj Mukherjee on how AI is revolutionizing hiring by prioritizing skills over traditional credentials. It reminded me of the importance of looking beyond degrees and focusing on what truly matters—a candidate’s abilities.

Key takeaways:
✅ Rethink hiring requirements: Degrees don’t define talent. Over 70 million workers are ""Skilled Through Alternative Routes"" (STARs). Are we overlooking them?
✅ AI broadens the talent pool: AI helps match candidates with the right skills, even if they don’t fit the “traditional mold.”
✅ Diverse teams = better outcomes: Hiring for skills leads to more innovative, productive, and resilient teams.

As a Bench sales recruiter, I’ve seen firsthand how focusing on skills over credentials can uncover hidden gems. Let’s embrace this shift and build stronger, more inclusive teams.

What’s your take? How can we make hiring more skills-focused in IT staffing? Let’s discuss! 👇

"If your company doesn’t adopt AI in recruitment, you will lose!

The way companies hire talent is changing faster than ever—and AI is at the center of it. If your recruitment process is still relying on manual job postings, traditional sourcing, and human-only decision-making, you’re already losing the hiring race to competitors who are leveraging AI-driven recruitment.

Why AI is a game-changer in hiring

🚀 AI-generated job & assignment descriptions – No more manually writing job ads; AI analyzes market trends and auto-generates tailored descriptions.
🚀 Faster, smarter talent acquisition – AI instantly scans, filters, and ranks candidates based on skills, experience, and behavioral patterns.
🚀 Automated talent pool management – AI keeps track of availability, skills, and career progression, so the best candidates are always within reach.
🚀 AI-personalized communication – Integrating with tools like Crystal Knows, AI identifies personality types (DISC model) and adjusts communication style to maximize engagement.
🚀 Instant search & matching based on data – AI doesn’t rely on guesswork; it analyzes structured data to find the perfect fit faster than any recruiter ever could.

But here’s the problem: bad data = bad AI = bad hiring

❌ Outdated, unstructured ATS & CRM systems lead to inaccurate matches.
❌ No GDPR compliance? AI won’t be able to process candidate data.

Your competitors are already using AI—are you?

📌 Companies leveraging AI in recruitment are filling roles faster, reducing costs, and improving candidate quality.
📌 Those who don’t will be left behind, struggling with slow, outdated processes.

The future of hiring is already here. If your company isn’t integrating AI into recruitment, you’re not just behind; you’re actively losing top talent to competitors who are.

"AI is everywhere, transforming industries and automating processes. But here’s what is missing from the conversation: Who is going to build, manage, and govern all this AI?

I’ve seen companies pour millions into AI, expecting instant results - only to realize they don’t have the right people to make it work. They assume hiring AI professionals is simple, but the truth is AI talent is scarce, the best candidates have multiple offers, and AI hiring tools are eliminating qualified people before a human even sees their resume.

We are now in a situation where:
- Companies desperately need AI talent but can’t find it
- AI hiring systems are making the problem worse
- Most organizations are not investing in AI reskilling for their workforce

AI cannot run itself. Companies who want to succeed need to:
- Invest in AI training and reskilling, not just external hiring
- Fix AI hiring systems so they don’t filter out great candidates
- Prioritize real skills and problem-solving over rigid job descriptions

At, we have build AI models that work in real business environments, and I can tell you this - technology is never the hardest part. The hardest part is finding and developing the right people.

If businesses don’t fix this now, they’ll struggle - not because they lack AI, but because they lack the workforce to make it work.

Call me old-fashioned, but shouldn't a person be involved in evaluating a person's potential?

I get it. Companies are flooded with applications. Automation is tempting. But are we really okay outsourcing decisions about someone's livelihood to an algorithm? An algorithm that could be biased, flawed, or just plain wrong?

The lack of personalized feedback. It's about a trend that dehumanizes the job search process. Makes candidates feel like numbers, not people with skills, dreams, & stories to tell.

We need to talk about this. Are we building a future where humans are judged by robots?

"From building the Alexa AI team to shaping the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) at Amazon—Alexander Lopez has spent the last three years recruiting top AI talent to drive innovation. Curious about what it takes to break into AGI? Alex shares insights on career paths, industry trends, and what makes recruiting in this space so unique. Read on for his advice!

🎤 Can you tell us about your journey at Amazon and what led you to your current role as a recruiter for Amazon AGI?
Over 3 years ago, I was tapped on the shoulder by an old Recruiting Manager to join and support the recruiting efforts to build out Alexa AI. Fast forward to 2025, I now support Amazon AGI, the team creating state-of-the-art foundation models that deliver frontier intelligence and industry leading price-performance on Amazon Bedrock.

🎤 What types of roles is AGI hiring for?
There’s a lot of unique opportunities here at Amazon. There’s a link at the end of this post that shares all the open job opportunities, among them you’ll find positions at different levels for Machine Learning Data Associates, Engineers, Applied Scientists, and more.

🎤 What advice do you have for someone who wants to start their career in the AGI space?
What was new, is no longer new, as the world of AGI is rapidly evolving! That said, ideally, we’re looking for talent who can bridge the gap between different domains, think creatively about complex problems, and work well in highly collaborative environments. Additionally, those who can learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, and contribute to the advancement of this transformative field.

🎤 Happy 3 year Amaversary! What’s been a standout moment for you so far since starting here?
Over the past 3 years, our team has grown exponentially, bringing on board some of the brightest minds in the industry. I'm immensely proud of the incredible talent we've recruited, the innovative solutions our new Amazonians have delivered to our customers, and the constant drive to hire and develop the best (Key Amazon Leadership principle).

🎤 What’s something unique about your job as a recruiter that people might not expect?
Collaboration, co-creation, and synergy comes to mind. Whether it's jumping on info-calls with passive candidates or joint-sourcing sessions, our AGI leaders take a vested interest in our efforts to scale up and build out our talent pools.

"AI is changing M&A… or is it?

Everyone’s talking about how AI is ""revolutionising"" deal origination and due diligence. But let’s be real—where is it actually making an impact, and where is it just buzz?

✅ Where AI delivers real results:
🔹 Automated deal sourcing → AI flags high-potential targets based on hiring trends, partnerships, and leadership moves.
🔹 Due diligence risk detection → AI scans contracts, litigation records, and compliance risks in minutes, not weeks.
🔹 Predictive analytics → AI models can forecast which companies are primed for acquisition based on historical data.

❌ Where AI still falls short:
🔹 Relationship-driven negotiations → No algorithm can replace trust.
🔹 Contextual judgment calls → AI can detect signals, but it can’t make strategic decisions for you.
🔹 Bad data, bad outcomes → AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on.

The takeaway? AI isn’t replacing M&A teams—it’s giving them a sharper competitive edge.

-Tech hiring becoming AI-focused
-Fewer entry-level opportunities

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲

• Startups have less full-time headcount than they did at any point in the last 5 years.

• This ""lean company"" trend is taking place across different funding stages.

• It is happening across many industries (SaaS + Fintech + Healthtech is shown but the same trend is true for Hardware, etc).

𝗥𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲)

1. Companies over-hired in the boom years and are now just being more capital efficient with their payroll.

2. Companies are using a lot more consultants/fractional or offshored resources and those people don't get equity so they don't show up in the analysis.

3. Companies are using AI to make their lean teams more productive, meaning they no longer need to hire as many folks as before.

My personal take is that explanation 1 is mostly responsible for the decline from 2022 to 2023. Startups just got religion again on being better stewards of capital.

But the decline from 2023 to 2024...now maybe that's partly AI. And if we run these numbers again in 2025 and they're lower still, then I think AI has to be a primary reason.

AI may not be taking your job today. It may be preventing your dream startup from ever hiring the role you want in the future.

"The Decline in Software Development Job Postings: What’s Driving It?

We’re seeing a marked decrease in developer roles across major markets including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Canada. Here are the top reasons:

- Over-Hiring During COVID: Companies scrambled to meet pandemic-fueled digital demand, and now many are recalibrating headcounts.
- Remote Work Shifts: After going “all-remote,” some organizations are pulling back or opting for hybrid models, reducing net-new positions.
- Team Reshuffling: Instead of opening new roles, many businesses are reassigning current talent to priority projects.
- Rising Interest Rates: Higher borrowing costs mean tighter budgets, prompting a cautious stance on hiring.
- AI-Driven Efficiency: Advancements in AI are automating tasks that previously required large engineering teams, dampening the need for more hires.

🚀 The AI Revolution: Are We Ready?
AI is transforming industries, redefining workflows, and reshaping jobs. From self-driving cars to AI-powered chatbots, automation is revolutionizing business operations. But is AI replacing jobs, or creating new opportunities? Let’s explore.

AI enhances efficiency but also replaces traditional roles in: ✅ Manufacturing: Robots streamline production. ✅ Retail & Customer Service: AI chatbots manage queries. ✅ Finance: AI automates risk assessment and trading. ✅ Healthcare: AI assists in diagnostics and surgeries.
However, AI also creates jobs in cybersecurity, data science, and AI ethics. The key challenge? Upskilling the workforce.


📈 The Rise of AI-Augmented Jobs
AI enhances human potential, enabling focus on creativity and strategy: 🔹 HR & Recruitment: AI helps streamline hiring, but human judgment is crucial. 🔹 Marketing: AI predicts trends, but marketers craft impactful campaigns. 🔹 Healthcare: AI aids in diagnosis, but doctors ensure ethical decisions.

"The Product Management hiring market is shifting – here’s what you need to know:

The market is picking up, but it’s not the same as before. Hiring is slower, competition is tougher, and business impact matters more than ever.

If you’re hiring (or job hunting), these trends matter:

→ Hiring is still messy
Talent teams are rebuilding, but slow processes, high volumes, and delays persist.

→ Jobs are on the rise
More PM roles, but hiring is selective—niche expertise gives you an edge.

→ Jobs aren’t always advertised
Many companies hire quietly—networking and visibility matter more than job boards.

→ Hands-on vs leadership
Companies favour experienced ICs—leaders must prove execution, not just management.

→ Specialisation matters
Generalist PMs face more competition—AI, fintech, B2B SaaS, and growth PMs are in demand.

→ Business impact is key
Hiring managers want data-driven PMs who can prove revenue, efficiency, and ROI.

→ Harder to switch industries
Companies prioritise industry experience—pivots require clear transferable skills.

→ Salaries remain competitive
Expect offers within 10% of your current salary—big jumps (20%+) are rare.

💡 The key takeaway?
The market is moving, but strategy matters. Positioning and networking give you an edge.

"Did you know that 75% of hiring managers admit to hiring the wrong person for the role?
How to fix it?

Candidate Targeting.

Building a strategic talent pipeline isn’t about posting jobs and hoping for the best. It’s about proactively targeting the right candidates before you even need them.

Here’s how top companies are doing it:

1: Define Your “Ideal Candidate” with Precision

Generic job descriptions attract generic candidates. The best companies know exactly who they’re looking for.

🟢 Example:doesn’t just hire “software engineers.” They target candidates with specific skills, like machine learning expertise or experience in scalable systems. This precision reduces misfires and speeds up hiring.

2: Build Relationships, Not Just Pipelines

Talent pipelines aren’t just databases—they’re networks. Companies like HubSpot engage with candidates long before they have open roles.

🟢 Example:’s recruiters regularly share valuable content and interact with potential candidates on LinkedIn. When a role opens, they already have a pool of engaged, interested professionals ready to go.

3: Use Data to Predict Talent Trends

Data-driven companies don’t guess—they analyze. They track where their top performers come from and what skills they bring.

🟢 Example:uses data to identify the traits of their most successful employees. They then target candidates who match those traits, resulting in higher retention and performance.

4: Automate the Grunt Work

Manual sourcing is a time-suck. Smart companies use tools to automate repetitive tasks.

🟢 Example:uses AI-powered platforms like Pymetrics to screen candidates and assess their fit. This reduced their hiring time by 75% and improved candidate quality.

5: Think Long-Term, Not Reactive

The best pipelines are built over time, not during a hiring crunch. Companies like Amazon focus on nurturing passive candidates.

🟢 Example:maintains a pipeline of thousands of passive candidates. When it needs to scale, it can fill roles in weeks, not months.

Instead of scrambling to fill roles, companies with strategic pipelines have a pool of pre-qualified, engaged candidates ready to go.

This means spending less time sifting through resumes and more time focusing on strategic priorities, such as growing the business or improving team culture.

What’s the biggest challenge your company faces when building a talent pipeline?

"AI in Hiring: Is It Fair or Flawed? 🤖

AI is revolutionizing recruitment—from scanning resumes and shortlisting candidates to even conducting initial interviews. The promise? Faster, more efficient, and data-driven hiring decisions. But the big question remains: Can AI truly understand human potential?

Many organizations are adopting AI-powered recruitment tools to eliminate human bias, streamline processes, and improve candidate matching. However, critics argue that AI might be reinforcing biases instead of removing them. After all, an algorithm learns from past data, and if that data contains biased hiring patterns, the AI may unknowingly replicate them.
The Debate: Pros & Cons of AI in Hiring

✅ Why AI is a Game-Changer:
✔ Faster Hiring: AI screens thousands of resumes in seconds, reducing the workload for recruiters.
✔ Objective Decision-Making: AI-based systems focus on skills and qualifications, potentially reducing bias.
✔ Better Candidate Matching: AI can analyse vast amounts of data to find the best fit for a role.

⚠ Concerns About AI in Recruitment:
❌ Bias in Algorithms: AI learns from historical data, which may contain inherent biases, leading to unfair hiring decisions.
❌ Lack of Human Judgment: Can AI assess soft skills, emotional intelligence, and cultural fit as effectively as a human recruiter?
❌ Data Privacy Issues: AI relies on large datasets, raising concerns about data security and ethical hiring practices.
With technology rapidly evolving, we must ask ourselves: Is AI making hiring better or worse?

"AI is dismantling jobs faster than workers can adapt. Education must hold the line.

We’ve heard it before: AI will create more jobs than it destroys. Reports from policymakers and industry leaders celebrate the promise of reskilling, insisting that workers will seamlessly transition into new careers.

But history tells a different story. Disruption is not neutral. Entire industries have crumbled under automation, leaving behind workers who lacked the time, resources, or opportunities to pivot. The numbers on AI-driven job creation often ignore the cost of transition—the financial strain, the gaps in retraining, and the reality that new roles rarely emerge where old ones disappear.

This is why education cannot take a backseat in the AI conversation. Unlike industries chasing short-term efficiency, education’s mandate is long-term: to preserve dignity, foster resilience, and ensure people are not left behind.
In my latest article, I explore:

✅ Why the standard reskilling narrative is inadequate
✅ How Further Education colleges are leading AI adoption responsibly
✅ What businesses must learn from education before making costly AI missteps

As a passionate recruiter and lover of technology I have a gut feeling that there is another golden age of recruitment on the horizon (anyone with less than 10 years in recruitment this did happen) .
As Ai is more widely adopted for aiding everyone to do everything, things will start to look more and more generic including CV's/resumes.

"""AI is revolutionizing recruitment""

I was scrolling through TikTok recently and came across a video discussing the growing role of AI in recruitment. While AI certainly offers incredible benefits, such as speeding up the screening process, it got me thinking: Are we overlooking something critical?

The video highlighted how many qualified candidates are getting automatically rejected by AI-powered systems due to overly rigid screening functions. These systems might not fully capture a candidate's potential, missing out on those who could be a perfect fit for the role but don’t quite meet the keyword-heavy criteria set by the algorithm.

This is where recruiters continue to be absolutely fundamental to the process. 🤝

While AI can help us sort through massive pools of applicants, it’s the human touch that ensures no good candidate falls through the cracks. We bring context, understanding, and a level of empathy that technology just can’t replace.

At the end of the day, AI is a tool, but it’s the recruiter’s expertise and intuition that really connects the dots and builds the most successful teams. 🚀",2024-12-01,"{'likes': 11, 'comments_count': 3, 'reposts': 0, 'total_engagement': 11}",LinkedIn, ,Positive,Opinionated

"Are we moving into the ""Great Reskilling"" era? Hear me out.

A few observations:

🔸We're experiencing a ""white-collar recession"" where knowledge workers are experiencing long-term unemployment--some stretching up to a year+.

🔸The fed cuts are throwing gov workers into the market, some targeting sectors where their legacy software or irrelevant processes don't match up to today's market demand. While capable, their toolsets may not be as marketable as current tech.

🔸And, of course, AI. What's the new saying? You won't be replaced by AI, but those who leverage AI will outpace those who don't. Particularly for knowledge workers--marketers, engineers, analysts--the pressure to stay fresh on adopting these tools is here.

Where are we with solutions?

🔹Employers become more flexible, giving ample time and resources for training. ""Hire for potential.""

🔹Professionals take on the initiative of reskilling to stay competitive with market demand.

Virginia and Maryland governors are attempting to create pathways for displaced workers. Wes Moore announced last week that there are over 1600 teaching jobs available in Maryland--a pathway for a second career.

Here's my question: will these displaced fed workers embrace teaching as a second career? Are the 250k jobs posted on the Virginiahasjobs site aligned with the skill sets of the displaced workers?

"The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is often praised for improving efficiency and cutting costs, but its broader economic effects warrant scrutiny.
The U.S. tech sector is a cornerstone of the economy, with 1.36 million software developers in 2023 and 284,100 more projected by 2028. High-skill roles, particularly in software and data science, face increasing AI exposure—about one-third of U.S. jobs are at risk.

Offshoring has already reshaped the job market. In 2022, businesses spent over $700 billion on outsourcing, with IT services accounting for $519 billion. By 2024, roughly 300,000 U.S. jobs were offshored annually. Despite high domestic demand, cost pressures continue shifting jobs overseas.
History shows that widespread job displacement isn’t just a worker issue—it ripples through entire economies. The decline of manufacturing hollowed out the Rust Belt, leading to lasting economic decline. Tech once filled the void left by manufacturing, but today, no clear successor exists.

The immediate cost savings of AI-driven automation and offshoring may come at the expense of long-term economic stability. Without careful planning, the same cycle of job loss and economic decline could repeat.

-  Know the basics of AI
-  Spot real use cases in daily work
-  Apply AI concepts into workflows

2. Capabilities & Adaptability
-  Craft effective prompts
-  Explore functionalities with curiosity
-  Develop creative solutions to problems

3. Risk Awareness
-  Identify ethical issues early
-  Guard & protect sensitive data
-  Recognise biases & hallucinations

"Does the convenience of AI come at the cost of our critical thinking skills? 

Are we becoming overly dependent on AI, hindering our ability to think deeply and independently?

⤵️Let's examine five ways AI might be contributing to intellectual laziness:

1/ Reduced Effort in Information Gathering and Analysis
AI readily provides answers, eliminating the need for extensive research and critical analysis. This readily available information bypasses the mental effort required for independent problem-solving. We become passive recipients of information rather than active seekers of knowledge.

2/ Diminished Critical Thinking Skills
Over-reliance on AI's outputs reduces the need to verify information, question assumptions, or consider alternative perspectives. This constant reliance on AI can atrophy our critical thinking muscles, leading to a decline in our ability to independently evaluate information and form our own conclusions.

3/ Erosion of Curiosity and Questioning
The ease of obtaining answers from AI can stifle our natural curiosity and the desire to explore complex issues. Instead of formulating our own questions and seeking answers through investigation, we become content with accepting AI's output without deeper inquiry.

4/ Overdependence and Skill Degradation
Consistent use of AI for tasks that previously required independent thought can lead to a decline in problem-solving skills and independent thinking. We become overly dependent on the tool, losing the ability to tackle challenges without AI's assistance.

5/ Ethical Judgment Bypass
Although AI can process data, it lacks the ethical judgment and contextual understanding that humans possess. Relying solely on AI's output for complex decisions can lead to overlooking ethical considerations or unintended consequences, as AI operates without a moral compass.

⤵️ The future of critical thinking in the age of AI depends on us.

It’s a long read, and I know not everyone has the time (or patience!) to get through it. So, I thought I’d make it easier by sharing key insights for people over the next few weeks....... Here’s the first takeaway:
Job changes
💡 AI will drive both job growth and automation – AI and Machine Learning Specialists, Data Analysts, and Cybersecurity Experts are among the fastest-growing roles (p. 19).
💡 Clerical and administrative roles are in decline – Administrative assistants, bookkeeping clerks, and factory workers are among the jobs most at risk due to automation (p. 19).
💡 Demographic shifts will reshape job demand – Aging populations are driving demand for healthcare workers, teachers, and vocational professionals (p. 15).

According to the report, nearly 40% of skills required on the job are expected to change, and 63% of employers identify the skills gap as a primary barrier to business transformation.

Additionally, the report projects that 59% of the global workforce will require reskilling or upskilling by 2030, with 11% unlikely to receive it, translating to over 120 million workers at medium-term risk of redundancy.

And what better day to talk about this than International Women’s Day?

Because when we focus on skills, not just job titles or degrees, we unlock hidden talent, especially for women who are:

- Returning to work after maternity leave
- Pivoting into new careers
- Stepping into leadership roles

I’ve seen firsthand how skills-based hiring fuels innovation, stronger decision-making, and better business performance. Companies that embrace this mindset don’t just improve diversity; they gain a competitive edge in today’s fast-moving markets.

Key Takeaways for Vietnam & SEA:

✅ The tech & AI talent pool could grow 8x, but many companies still rely on outdated hiring methods.
✅ Green jobs & sustainability roles will need massive reskilling: Are businesses ready?
✅ Women remain underrepresented in leadership & tech, yet skills-based hiring could boost their representation by 24% in AI roles.

On this International Women’s Day, let’s commit to making skills-based hiring the norm, not the exception. It’s not just about inclusion, it’s about unlocking real business potential.

"6 weeks into the new administration, too early to call how the federal government will drive talent transformation, but here's what I'd say to my federal learning leaders if I were asked to predict...

1. Your agency's capabilities & readiness to quickly pivot to meet reskilling & upskilling demands directed through the President's Management Agenda, Executive Actions, and other top-down mandates will be critical to your success as a learning leader, and to the success of the employees who depend on your team to provide them with the training needed to competently perform their jobs.

2. You should expect and be prepared for a surge in AI, Cybersecurity, Data/Analytics and other workforce modernization mandates. Given the unprecedented pace and rigor of execution demanded by the administration, you and the employees you serve will be faced with reskilling/upskilling requirements that must be met within a matter of days or weeks — not months or years. Therefore, it's imperative that you be prepared to meet a wide range of talent development needs at any time across a broad set of technology, business, leadership, safety, and federal legal areas.

3. Get your learning technology right. Simplicity & beauty are key. Jettison your cumbersome, disjointed, costly legacy learning management systems right now. Lean in to a modern, frictionless, FedRAMP-authorized enterprise learning experience platform that's purpose-built to elevate human performance. It must employ safe AI, offer multi-modal digital content & blended virtual ILT capabilities, AI-generated role-based learning paths, and it must enable you to assess and index skill proficiency so that your agency knows at any given moment where its skill strengths and gaps exist - you're going to be asked about this every day.

4. You will be constantly measured against uncomfortable metrics, so mitigate risk and increase your probability for success by sole sourcing with an experienced, trusted partner with a long and strong track record. Don't overlook quality of the provider's Customer Success team - you're going to need the help of experienced professionals who know what they're doing.

"AI isn’t just changing jobs—it’s changing the very nature of work.

I recently spoke with Yahoo Finance about the evolving demand for tech talent and the tech layoffs making headlines (link in comments).

While AI is reshaping industries, the real challenge isn’t just which jobs are in demand—it’s how companies redesign work itself.

Too many organizations focus only on AI automation, missing the bigger opportunity:

❗ What happens when employees complete tasks faster?

When AI automates tasks, leaders must deliberately decide how to reinvest human potential—or risk employees becoming disengaged, underutilized, and without a clear roadmap for their future.

The key isn’t just reskilling. It’s rethinking work so AI and human potential thrive together.

At this point, I feel like I’m speed-running the entire job market just to get ghosted by companies I didn’t even want in the first place.

But you know what? If AI and hiring managers won’t give me a chance, I’ll just create my own opportunity. The best candidates aren’t always the ones with the perfect CV—they’re the ones who refuse to give up.

"AI: The Essential Ally for IT Recruiters 👋
